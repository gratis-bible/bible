  <div type='book' osisID='Acts'>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>The first account I wrote, Theophilus, concerned all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>until the day in which he was received up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>To these he also showed himself alive after he suffered, by many proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days, and speaking about God's Kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>Being assembled together with them, he commanded them, "Do not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which you heard from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>For John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>Therefore, when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set within his own authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>When he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>While they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white clothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>who also said, "You men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who was received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you saw him going into the sky."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>When they had come in, they went up into the upper room, where they were staying; that is Peter, John, Jacob, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, Jacob the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>All these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>In these days, Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers (and the number of names was about one hundred twenty), and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>"Brothers, it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>For he was numbered with us, and received his portion in this ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>Now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness, and falling headlong, his body burst open, and all his intestines gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>It became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called 'Hakel-Dema,' that is, 'The field of blood.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>For it is written in the scroll of Psalms,'Let his habitation be made desolate.Let no one dwell therein;'and,'Let another take his office.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>"Of the men therefore who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>beginning from the baptism of John, to the day that he was received up from us, of these one must become a witness with us of his resurrection."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>They put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>They prayed, and said, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have chosen</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>to take part in this ministry and office of apostle from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>They drew lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the Eleven apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>Suddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and one sat on each of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other languages, as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>When this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking in his own language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>They were all amazed and marveled, saying, "Behold, are not all these who speak Galileans?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>How do we hear, everyone in our own native language?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the parts of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>Cretans and Arabians: we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>They were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, "What does this mean?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>Others, mocking, said, "They are filled with new wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>But Peter, standing up with the Eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke out to them, "You men of Judea, and all you who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only the third hour of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>But this is what has been spoken through the prophet Joel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>'It will be in the last days, says God,that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh.Your sons and your daughters will prophesy.Your young men will see visions.Your old men will dream dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>Yes, and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days,I will pour out my Spirit, and they will prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>I will show wonders in the sky above,and signs on the earth beneath;blood, and fire, and billows of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>The sun will be turned into darkness,and the moon into blood,before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>It will be, that whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>"Men of Israel, hear these words! Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as you yourselves know,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>him, being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>whom God raised up, having freed him from the pains of death, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>For David says concerning him,'I saw the Lord always before my face,For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced.Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>because you will not leave my soul in hell,neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>You made known to me the ways of life.You will make me full of gladness with your presence.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>"Brothers, I may tell you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that one of his descendants would sit on his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Messiah, that neither was he left in hell, nor did his flesh see decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>This Jesus God raised up, to which we all are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself,'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit by my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>"Let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Messiah, this Jesus whom you crucified."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>With many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>Then those who received his word were baptized. There were added that day about three thousand souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>They continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>Fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>All who believed were together, and had all things in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>Day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>praising God, and having favor with all the people. The Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>A certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried, whom they put daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask gifts for the needy of those who entered into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive gifts for the needy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>Peter, fastening his eyes on him, with John, said, "Look at us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>He listened to them, expecting to receive something from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>But Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none, but what I have, that I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>He took him by the right hand, and raised him up. Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>Leaping up, he stood, and began to walk. He entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>All the people saw him walking and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>They recognized him, that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>And as he held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>When Peter saw it, he responded to the people, "You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this man? Why do you fasten your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a man who was a murderer to be granted to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>and killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>By faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>"Now, brothers, I know that you did this in ignorance, as did also your rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>But the things which God announced by the mouth of all his prophets, that Messiah should suffer, he thus fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>"Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>and that he may send the Messiah Jesus, who was ordained for you before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God spoke long ago by the mouth of his holy prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>For Moses indeed said to the fathers, 'The Lord your God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, like me. You shall listen to him in all things whatever he says to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>It will be, that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, 'In your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>God, having raised up his Servant, sent him to you first, to bless you, in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>As they spoke to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>being upset because they taught the people and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>They laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>It happened in the morning, that their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>Annas the high priest was there, with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and as many as were relatives of the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>When they had stood them in the middle of them, they inquired, "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of the people, and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>if we are examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in him does this man stand here before you whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>He is 'the stone which was regarded as worthless by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>And there is salvation in none other, for there is no other name under heaven, that is given among men by which we must be saved!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled. They recognized that they had been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>Seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>saying, "What shall we do to these men? Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>But so that this spreads no further among the people, let us threaten them, that from now on they do not speak to anyone in this name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>They called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>for we cannot help telling the things which we saw and heard."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>When they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for everyone glorified God for that which was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>For the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed was more than forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>Being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>When they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, "Master, it is you who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>who by the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of your servant, David, said,'Why do the nations rage,and the peoples plot a vain thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings of the earth take a stand,and the rulers take council together,against the Lord, and against his Messiah.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>"For truly, in this city against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>to do whatever your hand and your council foreordained to happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>Now, Lord, look at their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.30'>while you stretch out your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy Servant Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were gathered together. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul. Not one of them claimed that anything of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>With great power, the apostles gave their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Great grace was on them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>For neither was there among them any who lacked, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.35'>and put them at the apostles' feet, and distribution was made to each, according as anyone had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of Encouragement), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.37'>having a field, sold it, and brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>But a certain man named Ananias, with Sappirah, his wife, sold a possession,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.2'>and kept back part of the price, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part, and put it at the apostles' feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>While you kept it, did not it remain your own? After it was sold, was not it in your power? How is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.5'>Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and died. Great fear came on all who heard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.6'>The young men arose and wrapped him up, and they carried him out and buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.7'>About three hours later, his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.8'>Peter answered her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much."She said, "Yes, for so much."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.9'>But Peter asked her, "How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.10'>She fell down immediately at his feet, and died. The young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>Great fear came on the whole church, and on all who heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>By the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. They were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.13'>None of the rest dared to join them, however the people honored them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>More believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>They even carried out the sick into the streets, and put them on cots and mattresses, so that as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.16'>Multitudes also came together from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick people, and those who were tormented by unclean spirits: and they were all healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.17'>But the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.18'>and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public custody.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.19'>But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night, and brought them out, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.20'>"Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>When they heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, and those who were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.22'>But the officers who came did not find them in the prison. They returned and reported,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>"We found the prison shut and locked, and the guards standing before the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>Now when the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>One came and told them, "Behold, the men whom you put in prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>Then the captain went with the officers, and brought them without violence, for they were afraid that the people might stone them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.27'>When they had brought them, they set them before the council. The high priest questioned them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.28'>saying, "Did not we strictly command you not to teach in this name? Behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood on us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>But Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God rather than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed, hanging him on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.31'>God exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.33'>But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and wanted to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>But one stood up in the council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law, honored by all the people, and commanded to put the men out for a little while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.35'>He said to them, "You men of Israel, be careful concerning these men, what you are about to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>For before these days Todah rose up, making himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.37'>After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment, and drew away some people after him. He also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.38'>Now I tell you, withdraw from these men, and leave them alone. For if this counsel or this work is of man, it will be overthrown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.39'>But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them, and you would be found even to be fighting against God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.40'>They agreed with him. Summoning the apostles, they beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.41'>They therefore departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.42'>Every day, in the temple and at home, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming Jesus, the Messiah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.7.4'>Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and lived in Haran. From there, when his father was dead, God moved him into this land, where you are now living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.5'>He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. He promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when he still had no child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.6'>God spoke in this way: that his seed would live as foreigners in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.7'>'I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,' said God, 'and after that will they come out, and serve me in this place.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.8'>He gave him the covenant of circumcision. So Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.9'>"The patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt. God was with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.10'>and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. He made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.11'>Now a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction. Our fathers found no food.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.4'>He fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.5'>He said, "Who are you, Lord?"The Lord said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.6'>But rise up, and enter into the city, and you will be told what you must do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.7'>The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the sound, but seeing no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no one. They led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>He was without sight for three days, and neither ate nor drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias!"He said, "Behold, it's me, Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>The Lord said to him, "Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus. For behold, he is praying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he did to your saints at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>Here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>But the Lord said to him, "Go your way, for he is my chosen vessel to bear my name before the nations and kings, and the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>For I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name's sake."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>Ananias departed, and entered into the house. Laying his hands on him, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he received his sight. He arose and was baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>He took food and was strengthened. He stayed several days with the disciples who were at Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>Immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>All who heard him were amazed, and said, "Is not this he who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called on this name? And he had come here intending to bring them bound before the chief priests!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>But Saul increased more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, proving that this is the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>When many days were fulfilled, the Jews conspired together to kill him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>but their plot became known to Saul. They watched the gates both day and night that they might kill him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>When Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.28'>He was with them coming in and going out in Jerusalem, proclaiming boldly in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>He spoke and disputed against the Hellenists, but they were seeking to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.30'>When the brothers knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him off to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, and were built up. They were multiplied, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>It happened, as Peter went throughout all those parts, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, because he was paralyzed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed!" Immediately he arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>All who lived at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which when translated, means Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and acts of mercy which she did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.37'>It happened in those days that she fell sick, and died. When they had washed her, they placed her in an upper chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him not to delay in coming to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>Peter got up and went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper chamber. All the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>Peter put them all out, and kneeled down and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, get up!" She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>He gave her his hand, and raised her up. Calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.43'>It happened, that he stayed many days in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>Now there was a certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>a devout man, and one who feared God with all his house, who gave gifts for the needy generously to the people, and always prayed to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>At about the ninth hour of the day, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him, and saying to him, "Cornelius!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>He, fastening his eyes on him, and being frightened, said, "What is it, Lord?"He said to him, "Your prayers and your gifts to the needy have gone up for a memorial before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>Now send men to Joppa, and get Simon, who is surnamed Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>He lodges with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>Having explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>Now on the next day as they were on their journey, and got close to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>He became hungry and desired to eat, but while they were preparing, he fell into a trance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>He saw heaven opened and a certain container descending to him, like a great sheet let down by four corners on the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>in which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>A voice came to him, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>But Peter said, "Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>A voice came to him again the second time, "What God has cleansed, you must not call unclean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>This was done three times, and immediately the vessel was received up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>Now while Peter was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood before the gate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, was lodging there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>While Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men seek you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>But arise, get down, and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>Peter went down to the men, and said, "Behold, I am he whom you seek. Why have you come?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God, and well spoken of by all the Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house, and to listen to what you say."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>So he called them in and lodged them. On the next day he arose and went out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>On the next day they entered into Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and his near friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>When it happened that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>But Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up! I myself am also a man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>He said to them, "You yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to join himself or come to one of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>Therefore also I came without complaint when I was sent for. I ask therefore, why did you send for me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>Cornelius said, "Four days ago until this hour, the ninth hour, I was praying in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>Send therefore to Joppa, and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter. He lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the seaside.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>Therefore I sent to you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>And Peter opened his mouth and said, "Truly I perceive that God does not show favoritism;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>but in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming good news of peace by Jesus Christ-he is Lord of all-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>that spoken word you yourselves know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>We are witnesses of everything he did both in the countryside of Judea, and in Jerusalem; whom they also killed, hanging him on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>God raised him up the third day, and gave him to be revealed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>He commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>All the prophets testify about him, that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>They of the circumcision who believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>For they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying God.Then Peter answered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>"Can any man forbid the water, that these who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we should not be baptized?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay some days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>When Peter had come up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>saying, "You went in to uncircumcised men, and ate with them!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>But Peter began, and explained to them in order, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>"I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain container descending, like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners. It came as far as me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>When I had looked intently at it, I considered, and saw the four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter, kill and eat!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>But I said, 'Not so, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>But a voice answered the second time out of heaven, 'What God has cleansed, do not call unclean.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>This was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>Behold, immediately three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>The Spirit told me to go with them, without discriminating. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying to him, 'Send to Joppa, and get Simon, whose surname is Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.14'>who will speak to you words by which you will be saved, you and all your house.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, 'John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>If then God gave to them the same gift as us, when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, "Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>They therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, proclaiming the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>The report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem. They sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>who, when he had come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad. He exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they should remain near to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>Barnabas went out to Tarsus to look for Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>When he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. It happened, that for a whole year they were gathered together with the church, and taught many people. The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>Now in these days, prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>One of them named Agabus stood up, and indicated by the Spirit that there should be a great famine all over the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>As any of the disciples had plenty, each determined to send relief to the brothers who lived in Judea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.30'>which they also did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.12'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.1'>Now about that time, Herod the king stretched out his hands to oppress some of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>He killed Jacob, the brother of John, with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>When he saw that it pleased the Jewish people, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This was during the days of unleavened bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>When he had arrested him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>Peter therefore was kept in the prison, but constant prayer was made by the church to God for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>The same night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. Guards in front of the door kept the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side, and woke him up, saying, "Stand up quickly!" His chains fell off from his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>The angel said to him, "Get dressed and put on your sandals." He did so. He said to him, "Put on your cloak, and follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he saw a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>When they were past the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened to them by itself. They went out, and went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>When Peter had come to himself, he said, "Now I truly know that the Lord has sent out his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from everything the Jewish people were expecting."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>Thinking about that, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>When Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a maid named Rhoda came to answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>When she recognized Peter's voice, she did not open the gate for joy, but ran in, and reported that Peter was standing in front of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>They said to her, "You are crazy!" But she insisted that it was so. They said, "It is his angel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>But Peter continued knocking. When they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>But he, beckoning to them with his hand to be silent, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He said, "Tell these things to Jacob, and to the brothers." Then he departed, and went to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>When Herod had sought for him, and did not find him, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. He went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus, the king's personal aide, their friend, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>On an appointed day, Herod dressed himself in royal clothing, sat on the throne, and gave a speech to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>The people shouted, "The voice of a god, and not of a man!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.23'>Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.24'>But the word of God grew and multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.25'>Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their service, also taking with them John whose surname was Mark.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.13'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.1'>Now in the church that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.2'>As they served the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, "Separate Barnabas and Saul for me, for the work to which I have called them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.3'>Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.4'>So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.5'>When they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. They had also John as their attendant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.6'>When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain man, a sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.7'>who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.8'>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.9'>But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.10'>and said, "Full of all deceit and all cunning, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.11'>Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season!"Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him. He went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.12'>Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.13'>Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.14'>But they, passing on from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.15'>After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, speak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.16'>Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, "Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.17'>The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they stayed as foreigners in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, he led them out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.18'>For a period of about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.19'>When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.20'>for about four hundred fifty years. After these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.21'>Afterward they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.22'>When he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, to whom he also testified, 'I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.23'>From this man's seed, according to his promise, God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.24'>before his coming, when John had first preached the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.25'>As John was fulfilling his course, he said, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. But behold, one comes after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.26'>Brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, the word of this salvation is sent out to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.27'>For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they did not know him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.28'>Though they found no cause for death, they still asked Pilate to have him killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.29'>When they had fulfilled all things that were written about him, they took him down from the tree, and placed him in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.30'>But God raised him from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.31'>and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.32'>We bring you good news of the promise made to the fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.33'>that God has fulfilled the same to us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second psalm,'You are my Son.Today I have become your father.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.34'>"Concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he has spoken thus: 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.35'>Therefore he says also in another psalm, 'You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.36'>For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was placed with his fathers, and saw decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.37'>But he whom God raised up saw no decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.38'>Be it known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man is proclaimed to you remission of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.39'>and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the Law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.40'>Beware therefore, lest that come on you which is spoken in the Prophets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.41'>'Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish;for I work a work in your days,a work which you will in no way believe, if one declares it to you.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.42'>So when they went out they begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.43'>Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.44'>The next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.45'>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.46'>Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, "It was necessary that God's word should be spoken to you first. Since indeed you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.47'>For so has the Lord commanded us, saying,'I have set you as a light for the Gentiles,that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.48'>As the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God. As many as were appointed to eternal life believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.49'>The Lord's word was spread abroad throughout all the region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.50'>But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.51'>But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.52'>The disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.14'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.1'>It happened in Iconium that they entered together into the Jewish synagogue, and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.2'>But the disbelieving Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.3'>Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.4'>But the multitude of the city was divided. Part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.5'>When some of both the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers, made a violent attempt to mistreat and stone them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.6'>they became aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.7'>There they preached the Good News.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.8'>At Lystra a certain man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.9'>He was listening to Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.10'>said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet!" He leaped up and walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia, "The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.12'>They called Barnabas "Jupiter," and Paul "Mercury," because he was the chief speaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.13'>The priest of Jupiter, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.14'>But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and sprang into the multitude, crying out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.15'>"Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the sky and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.16'>who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.17'>Yet he did not leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.18'>Even saying these things, they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.19'>But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.20'>But as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and entered into the city. On the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.21'>When they had preached the Good News to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.22'>confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.23'>When they had appointed elders for them in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.24'>They passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.25'>When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.26'>From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.27'>When they had arrived, and had gathered the church together, they reported all the things that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.28'>They stayed there with the disciples for a long time.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.15'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.1'>Some men came down from Judea and taught the brothers, "Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.2'>Therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no small discord and discussion with them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas, and some others of them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.3'>They, being sent on their way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles. They caused great joy to all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.4'>When they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all things that God had done with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.5'>But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the Law of Moses."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.6'>The apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>When there had been much discussion, Peter rose up and said to them, "Brothers, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the nations should hear the word of the Good News, and believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.8'>God, who knows the heart, testified about them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just like he did to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.9'>He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.10'>Now therefore why do you tempt God, that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.11'>But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they are."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.12'>All the multitude kept silence, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul reporting what signs and wonders God had done among the nations through them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.13'>After they were silent, Jacob answered, "Brothers, listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.14'>Simeon has reported how God first visited the nations, to take out of them a people for his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.15'>This agrees with the words of the prophets. As it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.16'>'After these things I will return.I will again build the tabernacle of David, which has fallen.I will again build its ruins.I will set it up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.17'>That the rest of men may seek after the Lord;All the Gentiles who are called by my name,'Says the Lord, who makes these things</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.18'>known from of old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.19'>"Therefore my judgment is that we do not trouble those from among the Gentiles who turn to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.20'>but that we write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.21'>For Moses from generations of old has in every city those who proclaim him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.22'>Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.23'>They wrote these things by their hand:"The apostles, the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.24'>Because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, to whom we gave no commandment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.25'>it seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.26'>men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.28'>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.29'>that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality, from which if you keep yourselves, it will be well with you. Farewell."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.30'>So, when they were sent off, they came to Antioch. Having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.31'>When they had read it, they rejoiced over the encouragement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.32'>Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers with many words, and strengthened them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.33'>After they had spent some time there, they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to those that had sent them forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.35'>But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming the word of the Lord, with many others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.36'>After some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.37'>Barnabas planned to take John, who was called Mark, with them also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.38'>But Paul did not think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia, and did not go with them to do the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.39'>Then the contention grew so sharp that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away to Cyprus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.40'>but Paul chose Silas, and went out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.41'>He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>He came to Derbe and Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess who believed; but his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.2'>The brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium gave a good testimony about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Paul wanted to have him go out with him, and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been ordained by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.5'>So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.6'>When they had gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.7'>When they had come opposite Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>Passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>A vision appeared to Paul in the night. There was a man of Macedonia standing, begging him, and saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.10'>When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to proclaim the Good News to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.11'>Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.12'>and from there to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the foremost of the district, a Roman colony. We were staying some days in this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>On the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the gate by a riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down, and spoke to the women who had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>A certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one who worshiped God, heard us; whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>When she and her household were baptized, she begged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and stay." So she persuaded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>It happened, as we were going to prayer, that a certain girl having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by fortune telling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>She followed Paul and us, shouting, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>She was doing this for many days.But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!" It came out that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>When they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, "These men, being Jews, are agitating our city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>The multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them, and commanded them to be beaten with rods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>When they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>who, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bonds were loosened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>The jailer, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.28'>But Paul shouted loudly, saying, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>He called for lights and sprang in, and, fell down trembling before Paul and Silas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>and brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>They spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>He took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized, he and all his household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>He brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his household, having believed in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, "Let those men go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, "The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out, and go in peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us publicly, without a trial, men who are Romans, and have cast us into prison! Do they now release us secretly? No indeed! Let them come themselves and bring us out!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>The sergeants reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>and they came and begged them. When they had brought them out, they asked them to depart from the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>They went out of the prison, and entered into Lydia's house. When they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them, and departed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>Paul, as was his custom, went in to them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>explaining and demonstrating that the Messiah had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Messiah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>Some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas, of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and not a few of the chief women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But the Jews, being moved with jealousy,  took along some wicked men from the marketplace, and gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar. Assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and certain brothers before the rulers of the city, crying, "These who have turned the world upside down have come here also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>whom Jason has received. These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>The multitude and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>When they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>Many of them therefore believed; also of the prominent Greek women, and not a few men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also, they came there likewise, agitating the multitudes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>Then the brothers immediately sent out Paul to go as far as to the sea, and Silas and Timothy still stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>But those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens. Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him very quickly, they departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also were conversing with him. Some said, "What does this babbler want to say?"Others said, "He seems to be advocating foreign deities," because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>They took hold of him, and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>For you bring certain strange things to our ears. We want to know therefore what these things mean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus, and said, "You men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: 'TO AN UNKNOWN God.' What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>neither is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, and all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>He made from one every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons, and the boundaries of their dwellings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>that they should seek God, if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>'For in him we live, and move, and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'For we are also his offspring.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, engraved by art and design of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked. But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, "We want to hear you again concerning this."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>Thus Paul went out from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>But certain men joined with him, and believed, among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>He found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, who had recently come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome. He came to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>and because he practiced the same trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>He departed there, and went into the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. Many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, "Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>He lived there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>saying, "This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I do not want to be a judge of these matters."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>He drove them from the judgment seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>Then all laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. Gallio did not care about any of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>Paul, having stayed after this many more days, took his leave of the brothers, and sailed from there for Syria, together with Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>They came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>When they asked him to stay a longer time, he declined;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>but taking his leave of them, and saying, "I will return again to you if God wills," he set sail from Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>Having spent some time there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus. He was mighty in the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside, and explained to him the way of God more accurately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he had come, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>for he powerfully refuted the Jews, publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>It happened that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper country, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?"They said to him, "No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>He said, "Into what then were you baptized?"They said, "Into John's baptism."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>Paul said, "John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with other languages and prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>They were about twelve men in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>He entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for a period of three months, reasoning and persuading about the things concerning the Kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>This continued for two years, so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and the evil spirits went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>But some of the itinerant Jews, exorcists, took on themselves to invoke over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>The evil spirit answered, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>The man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overpowered them all, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>Many also of those who had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. They counted the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>So the word of the Lord was growing and becoming mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>Now after these things had ended, Paul determined in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>Having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>About that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, "Sirs, you know that by this business we have our wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>You see and hear, that not at Ephesus alone, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing, and that she should even be deposed from her magnificence, whom all Asia and the world worships."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>When they heard this they were filled with anger, and began to shout, saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>The city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>When Paul wanted to enter in to the people, the disciples did not allow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>Certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>Some therefore shouted one thing, and some another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most of them did not know why they had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>They brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. Alexander beckoned with his hand, and would have made a defense to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice for a time of about two hours shouted, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>When the town clerk had quieted the multitude, he said, "You men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them press charges against one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>But if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day's riot, there being no cause. Concerning it, we would not be able to give an account of this commotion."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.41'>When he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging them, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>When he had gone through those parts, and had encouraged them with many words, he came into Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>When he had spent three months there, and a plot was made against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus of Beroea; Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>But these had gone ahead, and were waiting for us at Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>We sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and continued his speech until midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>There were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>A certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window, weighed down with deep sleep. As Paul spoke still longer, being weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>Paul went down, and fell upon him, and embracing him said, "Do not be troubled, for his life is in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>When he had gone up, and had broken bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of day, he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>They brought the boy in alive, and were greatly comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>But we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for he had so arranged, intending himself to go by land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.14'>When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard, and came to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>Sailing from there, we came the following day opposite Chios. The next day we landed at Samos, and the day after we came to Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to himself the elders of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>When they had come to him, he said to them, "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>Now, behold, I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.23'>except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But I make my life an account of nothing precious to myself, so that I may finish my race, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to fully testify to the Good News of the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>"Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about proclaiming the Kingdom, will see my face no more.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>When he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, "The Lord's will be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>After these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, bringing one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we would stay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.17'>When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>The day following, Paul went in with us to Jacob; and all the elders were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>When he had greeted them, he reported one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles through his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>They, when they heard it, glorified God. They said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Judeans of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>What then? They will certainly hear that you have come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>Therefore do what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>Take them, and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they have been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk keeping the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written our decision that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols, from blood, from strangled things, and from sexual immorality."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purified himself and went with them into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>crying out, "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the Law, and this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>For they had previously seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>All the city was moved, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple. Immediately the doors were shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>Immediately he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. They, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>Then the commanding officer came near, arrested him, commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>Some shouted one thing, and some another, among the crowd. When he could not find out the truth because of the noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>When he came to the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, "Away with him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he asked the commanding officer, "May I speak something to you?"He said, "Do you know Greek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>Are not you then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>But Paul said, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you, allow me to speak to the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people. When there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>"Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which I now make to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they were even more quiet. He said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>"I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the Law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as you all are this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>As also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify, from whom also I received letters to the brothers, and traveled to Damascus to bring them also who were there to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>It happened that, as I made my journey, and came close to Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from the sky a great light around me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' He said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>"Those who were with me indeed saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' The Lord said to me, 'Arise, and go into Damascus. There you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>When I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>One Ananias, a devout man according to the Law, well reported of by all the Jews who lived in Damascus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>came to me, and standing by me said to me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' In that very hour I looked up at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>He said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>Now why do you wait? Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>"It happened that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>and saw him saying to me, 'Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not receive testimony concerning me from you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>I said, 'Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>When the blood of Stephen, your witness, was shed, I also was standing by, and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>"He said to me, 'Depart, for I will send you out far from here to the Gentiles.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>They listened to him until he said that; then they lifted up their voice, and said, "Rid the earth of this fellow, for he is not fit to live!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>As they yelled, and threw off their cloaks, and threw dust into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the commanding officer commanded him to be brought into the barracks, ordering him to be examined by scourging, that he might know for what crime they yelled at him like that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>When they had tied him up with thongs, Paul asked the centurion who stood by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and not found guilty?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>When the centurion heard it, he went to the commanding officer and told him, "What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>The commanding officer came and asked him, "Tell me, are you a Roman?"He said, "Yes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>The commanding officer answered, "I bought my citizenship for a great price."Paul said, "But I was born a Roman."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>Immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him, and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman, because he had bound him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>But on the next day, desiring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Judeans, he freed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>Paul, looking steadfastly at the council, said, "Brothers, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>The high priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me according to the Law, and command me to be struck contrary to the law?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>Those who stood by said, "Do you malign God's high priest?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>Paul said, "I did not know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he shouted in the council, "Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>When he had said this, an argument arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess all of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>A great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and contended, saying, "We find no evil in this man. What if a spirit spoke to him, or an angel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>When a great argument arose, the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>The following night, the Lord stood by him, and said, "Cheer up, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must testify also at Rome."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>When it was day, the Judeans banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>There were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>They came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, "We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>Now therefore, you with the council inform the commanding officer that he should bring him down to you, as though you were going to judge his case more exactly. We are ready to kill him before he comes near."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>But Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>Paul summoned one of the centurions, and said, "Bring this young man to the commanding officer, for he has something to tell him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>So he took him, and brought him to the commanding officer, and said, "Paul, the prisoner, summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to tell you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>The commanding officer took him by the hand, and going aside, asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>He said, "The Judeans have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>Therefore do not yield to them, for more than forty men lie in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him. Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>So the commanding officer let the young man go, charging him, "Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>He called to himself two of the centurions, and said, "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, with seventy horsemen, and two hundred men armed with spears, at the third hour of the night."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>He asked them to provide animals, that they might set Paul on one, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>He wrote a letter like this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>"Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>"This man was seized by the Judeans, and was about to be killed by them, when I came with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>Desiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought him down to their council.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>I found him to be accused about questions of their law, but not to be charged with anything worthy of death or of imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>When I was told that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you immediately, charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>But on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>When the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from. When he understood that he was from Cilicia, he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>"I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive." He commanded that he be kept in Herod's palace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that by your foresight reforms are coming to this nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>But, that I do not delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>The Judeans also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered, "Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>In the temple they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the Law, and which are written in the Prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection, both of the just and unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>They ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>unless it is for this one thing that I shouted out standing among them, 'Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, "When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>He ordered the centurion that he should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, "Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul. Therefore also he sent for him more often, and talked with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Judeans, Felix left Paul in bonds.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>Then the high priest and the principal men of the Judeans informed him against Paul, and they begged him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem; plotting to kill him on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>However Festus answered that Paul should be kept in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>"Let them therefore," said he, "that are in power among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>When he had stayed among them more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>When he had come, the Judeans who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>while he said in his defense, "Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Judeans, answered Paul and said, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be judged by me there concerning these things?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Judeans, as you also know very well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>For if I have done wrong, and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of those things is true that they accuse me of, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, "You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you shall go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and greeted Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>As they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, "There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the Jewish elders informed me, asking for a sentence against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>To whom I answered that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, before the accused has met the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>When therefore they had come together here, I did not delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>but had certain questions against him about their own religion, and about one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>Being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>Agrippa said to Festus, "I also would like to hear the man myself.""Tomorrow," he said, "you shall hear him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>Festus said, "King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Judeans petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have something to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to also specify the charges against him."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>Agrippa said to Paul, "You may speak for yourself."Then Paul stretched out his hand, and made his defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>"I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you this day concerning all the things that I am accused by the Judeans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which are among Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>"Indeed, all Jews know my way of life from my youth up, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>having known me from the first, if they are willing to testify, that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>Now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I am accused by the Judeans, O King!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>Why is it judged incredible with you, if God does raise the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>"I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>This I also did in Jerusalem. I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>Punishing them often in all the synagogues, I tried to make them blaspheme. Being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>"Whereupon as I traveled to Damascus with the authority and commission from the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>at noon, O King, I saw on the way a light from the sky, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who traveled with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>When we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>"I said, 'Who are you, Lord?'"He said, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>But arise, and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of the things which I will reveal to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>"Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>but declared first to them of Damascus, at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>For this reason Jews seized me in the temple, and tried to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the Prophets and Moses said would happen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>how the Messiah must suffer, and how, by the resurrection of the dead, he would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>As he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul, you are crazy! Your great learning is driving you insane!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>But he said, "I am not crazy, most excellent Festus, but boldly declare words of truth and reasonableness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>For the king knows of these things, to whom also I speak freely. For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him, for this has not been done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>Agrippa said to Paul, "With a little persuasion are you trying to make me a Christian?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>Paul said, "I pray to God, that whether with little or with much, not only you, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these bonds."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>The king rose up with the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>When they had withdrawn, they spoke one to another, saying, "This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>Agrippa said to Festus, "This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>When it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>Embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea; Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>The next day, we landed at Sidon. Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him permission to go to his friends and refresh himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>When we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, and he put us on board.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>When we had sailed slowly many days, and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus, the wind not allowing us further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>With difficulty sailing along it we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>When much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast had now already gone by, Paul admonished them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>and said to them, "Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>Because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised going to sea from there, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a port of Crete, looking northeast and southeast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But before long, a stormy wind beat down from shore, which is called Euraquilo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>When the ship was caught, and could not face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>After they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help reinforce the ship. Fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor, and so were driven along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>As we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw things overboard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>On the third day, they threw out the ship's tackle with their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>When neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days, and no small storm pressed on us, all hope that we would be saved was now taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>When they had been long without food, Paul stood up in the middle of them, and said, "Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>Now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>For there stood by me this night an angel, belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>saying, 'Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>Therefore, sirs, cheer up! For I believe God, that it will be just as it has been spoken to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>But we must run aground on a certain island."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>They took soundings, and found twenty fathoms. After a little while, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>Fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for daylight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>As the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>While the day was coming on, Paul begged them all to take some food, saying, "This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>Therefore I beg you to take some food, for this is for your safety; for not a hair will perish from any of your heads."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>When he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it, and began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>Then they all cheered up, and they also took food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>In all, we were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>When it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay with a beach, and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>Casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes. Hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>But coming to a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground. The bow struck and remained immovable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>The soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim out and escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stopped them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go toward the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>and the rest should follow, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. So it happened that they all escaped safely to the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>When we had escaped, then we learned that the island was called Malta.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>The natives showed us uncommon kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and placed them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, "No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet Justice has not allowed to live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>However he shook off the creature into the fire, and was not harmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>But they expected that he would have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly, but when they watched for a long time and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and courteously entertained us for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>It happened that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery. Paul entered in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>Then when this was done, the rest also who had diseases in the island came, and were cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>They also honored us with many honors, and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>After three months, we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was "The Twin Brothers."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>From there we weighed anchor and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>where we found brothers, and were entreated to stay with them for seven days. So we came to Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>From there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God, and took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>When we entered into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>It happened that after three days Paul called together those who were the Jewish leaders. When they had come together, he said to them, "I, brothers, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But when the Judeans spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>For this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>They said to him, "We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we desire to hear from you what you think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>When they had appointed him a day, many people came to him at his lodging. He explained to them, testifying about the Kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from morning until evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>Some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>When they did not agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had spoken one word, "The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah, the prophet, to your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>saying,'Go to this people, and say,in hearing, you will hear,but will in no way understand.In seeing, you will see,but will in no way perceive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>For this people's heart has grown callous.Their ears are dull of hearing.Their eyes they have closed.Lest they should see with their eyes,hear with their ears,understand with their heart,and would turn again,and I would heal them.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>"Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the nations. They will also listen." [</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.29'>When he had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who were coming to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>proclaiming the Kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.</verse>
