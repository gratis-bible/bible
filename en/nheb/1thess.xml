      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We always give thanks to God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>We know, brothers loved by God, that you are chosen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>and that our Good News came to you not in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and with much assurance. You know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>You became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>so that you became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>For from you the word of the Lord has been declared, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out; so that we need not to say anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception we had from you; and how you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead-Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For you yourselves know, brothers, our visit to you was not in vain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as you know, at Philippi, we grew bold in our God to tell you the Good News of God in much conflict.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deception.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>But even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who tests our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For neither were we at any time found using words of flattery, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness (God is witness),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>nor seeking glory from men (neither from you nor from others), when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we were like children among you, like a nursing mother cherishes her own children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>Even so, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you, not the Good News of God only, but also our own souls, because you had become very dear to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail; for working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the Good News of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>You are witnesses with God, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>As you know, as a father with his own children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>we exhorted, comforted, and implored every one of you to lead a life worthy of God, who calls you into his own Kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>For this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when you received from us the word of the message of God, you accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also works in you who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus; for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they did from the Judeans;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and did not please God, and are contrary to all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always. But wrath has come on them to the uttermost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But we, brothers, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence, not in heart, tried even harder to see your face with great desire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>because we wanted to come to you-indeed, I, Paul, once and again-but Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Is not it even you, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>For you are our glory and our joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Therefore, when we could not stand it any longer, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>and sent Timothy, our brother and God's fellow worker in the Good News of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>that no one be moved by these afflictions. For you know that we are appointed to this task.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For truly, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction, even as it happened, and you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>For this cause I also, when I could not stand it any longer, sent that I might know your faith, for fear that by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor would have been in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But when Timothy came just now to us from you, and brought us glad news of your faith and love, and that you have good memories of us always, longing to see us, even as we also long to see you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>for this cause, brothers, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>For now we live, since you stand firm in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also do toward you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>to the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>Finally then, brothers, we beg and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to live and to please God, even as you are living, that you excel more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is the will of God: your sanctification, that you abstain from sexual immorality,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who do not know God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>that no one should take advantage of and wrong a brother or sister in this matter; because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore he who rejects this does not reject man, but God, who has also given his Holy Spirit to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But concerning brotherly love, you have no need that one write to you. For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brothers, that you abound more and more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, even as we instructed you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and may have need of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>But we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you do not grieve like the rest, who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For this we tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with God's trumpet. The dead in Christ will rise first,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. So we will be with the Lord forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Therefore comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>For when they are saying, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>You are all children of light, and children of the day. We do not belong to the night, nor to darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>so then let us not sleep, as the rest do, but let us watch and be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>and to respect and honor them in love for their work's sake.Be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>We exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good, for one another, and for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>Pray without ceasing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Do not quench the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Do not despise prophesies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>Abstain from every form of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brothers, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</verse>
