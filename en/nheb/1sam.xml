  <div type='book' osisID='1Sam'>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to the Lord, were there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but the Lord had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>Her rival taunted her severely, to irritate her, because the Lord had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>As he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the Lord, so she taunted her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>Elkanah her husband said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drank. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the Lord's temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the Lord, and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>She vowed a vow, and said, "Lord of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a boy, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>It happened, as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli saw her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>Eli said to her, "How long will you make yourself drunk? Put away your wine from you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>Hannah answered, "No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>Do not count your handmaid as a worthless woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my distress and my anguish."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>Then Eli answered, "Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>She said, "Let your handmaid find favor in your sight." So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression wasn't sad any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before the Lord, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>It happened, when the time had come, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, saying, "Because I have asked him of the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the Lord the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>But Hannah did not go up; for she said to her husband, "Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord, and stay there forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>Elkanah her husband said to her, "Do what seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may the Lord establish his word."So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with a three year old bull, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the Lord's house in Shiloh. The child was young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>She said, "Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>For this child I prayed; and the Lord has given me my petition which I asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>Therefore also I have granted him to the Lord. As long as he lives he is granted to the Lord." He worshiped the Lord there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>Hannah prayed, and said:"My heart exults in the Lord!My horn is exalted in the Lord.My mouth is enlarged over my enemies,because I rejoice in your salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>There is no one as holy as the Lord,For there is no one besides you,nor is there any rock like our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>"Talk no more so exceeding proudly.Do not let arrogance come out of your mouth,For the Lord is a God of knowledge.By him actions are weighed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>"The bows of the mighty men are broken.Those who stumbled are armed with strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread.Those who were hungry are satisfied.Yes, the barren has borne seven.She who has many children languishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>"The Lord kills, and makes alive.He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>The Lord makes poor, and makes rich.He brings low, he also lifts up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>He raises up the poor out of the dust.He lifts up the needy from the dunghill,To make them sit with princes,and inherit the throne of glory.For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's.He has set the world on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>He will keep the feet of his holy ones,but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness;for no man shall prevail by strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>Those who strive with the Lord shall be broken to pieces.He will thunder against them in the sky."The Lord will judge the ends of the earth.He will give strength to his king,and exalt the horn of his anointed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child served the Lord before Eli the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>Now the sons of Eli were base men; they did not know the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, "Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>If the man said to him, "Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul desires"; then he would say, "No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>The sin of the young men was very great before the Lord; for they despised the offering of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>But Samuel ministered before the Lord, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, "The Lord give you seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of the Lord." They went to their own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>The Lord visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>He said to them, "Why do you do such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make the Lord's people disobey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him?" Notwithstanding, they did not listen to the voice of their father, because the Lord intended to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with the Lord, and also with men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>A man of God came to Eli, and said to him, "Thus says the Lord, I plainly revealed myself to the house of your father, when they were slaves in Egypt to the house of Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me. And I gave to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>Why do you kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>"Therefore the Lord, the God of Israel, says, 'I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever.' But now the Lord says, 'Be it far from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>You shall see the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which I shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>The man of yours, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall consume your eyes, and grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>"'This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall both die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, "Please put me into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread."'"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>The child Samuel ministered to the Lord before Eli. The word of the Lord was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.2'>It happened at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.3'>and the lamp of God hadn't yet gone out, and Samuel had lain down in the Lord's temple, where the ark of God was;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.4'>that the Lord called Samuel; and he said, "Here I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.5'>He ran to Eli, and said, "Here I am; for you called me."He said, "I did not call; lie down again."He went and lay down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.6'>The Lord called yet again, "Samuel!"Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am; for you called me."He answered, "I did not call, my son; lie down again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.7'>Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.8'>The Lord called Samuel again the third time. He arose and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am; for you called me."Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.9'>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, "Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he calls you, that you shall say, 'Speak, Lord; for your servant hears.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.10'>The Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times, "Samuel! Samuel!"Then Samuel said, "Speak; for your servant hears."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.11'>The Lord said to Samuel, "Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.12'>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.13'>For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he did not restrain them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.14'>Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be removed with sacrifice nor offering forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.15'>Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord. Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.16'>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, "Samuel, my son!"He said, "Here I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.17'>He said, "What is the thing that he has spoken to you? Please do not hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.18'>Samuel told him every bit, and hid nothing from him.He said, "It is the Lord. Let him do what seems good to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.19'>Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.20'>All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.21'>The Lord appeared again in Shiloh; for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.1'>The word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.2'>The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was struck before the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.3'>When the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Why has the Lord struck us today before the Philistines? Let us get the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.4'>So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, who sits above the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.5'>When the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.6'>When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, "What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?" They understood that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.7'>The Philistines were afraid, for they said, "God has come into the camp." They said, "Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.8'>Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.9'>Be strong, and behave like men, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Strengthen yourselves like men, and fight!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.10'>The Philistines fought, and Israel was struck, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.11'>The ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.12'>There ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn, and with earth on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.13'>When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. When the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.14'>When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, "What does the noise of this tumult mean?"The man hurried, and came and told Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.15'>Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.16'>The man said to Eli, "I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army."He said, "How did the matter go, my son?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.17'>He who brought the news answered, "Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.18'>It happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck broke, and he died; for he was an old man, and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.19'>His daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered. When she heard the news that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth; for her pains came on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.20'>About the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, "Do not be afraid; for you have given birth to a son." But she did not answer, neither did she regard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.21'>She named the child Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel"; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.22'>She said, "The glory has departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.1'>Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.2'>The Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.3'>When they of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord. They took Dagon, and set him in his place again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.4'>When they arose early on the next day morning, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off on the threshold. Only Dagon's torso was intact.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.5'>Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.6'>But the hand of the Lord was heavy on them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and struck them with tumors, even Ashdod and its borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.7'>When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, "The ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us; for his hand is severe on us, and on Dagon our god."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.8'>They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?"They answered, "Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried over to Gath." They carried the ark of the God of Israel there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.9'>It was so, that after they had carried it about, the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great confusion: and he struck the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors broke out on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.10'>So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.It happened, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, "They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.11'>They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, "Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people."

        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.4'>Then they said, "What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him?"They said, "Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, for the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.5'>Therefore you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel: perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.6'>Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had worked wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.14'>The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel recovered its territory out of the hand of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.9'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.1'>Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.2'>He had a son, whose name was Saul, an impressive young man; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he. From his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.3'>The donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. Kish said to Saul his son, "Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.4'>He passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they weren't there: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.5'>When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, "Come, and let us return, lest my father stop caring about the donkeys, and be anxious for us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.6'>He said to him, "See now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man who is held in honor. All that he says surely comes to pass. Now let us go there. Perhaps he can tell us concerning our journey on which we have set out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.7'>Then Saul said to his servant, "But behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is gone in our vessels, and there is no gift to bring to the man of God. What do we have?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.8'>The servant answered Saul again, and said, "Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.9'>(In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he would say, "Come, and let us go to the seer"; for he who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.10'>Then Saul said to his servant, "Well said. Come, let us go." So they went to the city where the man of God was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.11'>As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, "Is the seer here?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.12'>They answered them, and said, "He is. Behold, he is ahead of you. Hurry now, for he has come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.13'>As soon as you have come into the city, you shall immediately find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he comes, because he blesses the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited eat. Now therefore go up; for at this time you shall find him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.14'>They went up to the city. As they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.15'>Now the Lord had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.16'>"Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry has come to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.17'>When Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said to him, "Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! This one shall have authority over my people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.18'>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, "Please tell me where the seer's house is."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.19'>Samuel answered Saul, and said, "I am he. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today. In the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.20'>As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them; for they have been found. And for whom does all Israel desire? Is it not for you, and for all your father's house?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.21'>Saul answered, "Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak to me like this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.22'>Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest room, and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.23'>And Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I told you to set aside."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.24'>The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. And he said, "Behold, that which has been reserved! Set it before yourself and eat; because for the appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, 'I have invited the people.'" So Saul ate with Samuel that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.25'>When they had come down from the high place into the city, he talked with Saul on the housetop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.26'>They arose early: and it happened about daybreak, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, "Get up, that I may send you away." Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, went outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.27'>As they were going down at the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go on ahead," (and he passed on), "but remain here awhile, that I may make known to you the word of God."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.10'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.1'>Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, "Isn't it that the Lord has anointed you to be prince over his inheritance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.2'>When you have departed from me today, then you shall find two men by Rachel's tomb, in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will tell you, 'The donkeys which you went to seek have been found; and behold, your father has stopped caring about the donkeys, and is anxious for you, saying, "What shall I do for my son?"'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.3'>"Then you shall go on forward from there, and you shall come to the oak of Tabor; and three men shall meet you there going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three young goats, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.4'>and they will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive of their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.5'>"After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall happen, when you have come there to the city, that you shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.6'>and the Spirit of the Lord will come mightily on you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.8'>"You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: you shall wait seven days, until I come to you, and show you what you shall do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.9'>It was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs happened that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.10'>When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.11'>It happened, when all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, "What is this that has come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.12'>One of the same place answered, "Who is their father?" Therefore it became a proverb, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.13'>When he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.14'>Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, "Where did you go?"He said, "To seek the donkeys. When we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.15'>Saul's uncle said, "Please tell me what Samuel said to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.16'>Saul said to his uncle, "He told us plainly that the donkeys were found." But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he did not tell him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.17'>Samuel called the people together to the Lord to Mizpah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.18'>and he said to the children of Israel, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, 'I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:'</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.20'>So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.21'>He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.</verse>

The dread of the Lord fell on the people, and they came out as one man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.8'>He numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.9'>They said to the messengers who came, "Thus you shall tell the men of Jabesh Gilead, 'Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance.'" The messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.10'>Therefore the men of Jabesh said, "Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do with us all that seems good to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.11'>It was so on the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it happened, that those who remained were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.12'>The people said to Samuel, "Who is he who said, 'Shall Saul reign over us?' Bring those men, that we may put them to death!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.13'>Saul said, "There shall not a man be put to death this day; for today the Lord has worked deliverance in Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.14'>Then Samuel said to the people, "Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.15'>All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace offerings before the Lord; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.1'>Saul reigned a year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.2'>Saul chose for himself three thousand men of Israel, of which two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the Mount of Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.3'>Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba: and the Philistines heard of it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, "Let the Hebrews hear!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.4'>All Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. The people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.5'>The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth Aven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.6'>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.7'>Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.8'>He stayed seven days, according to the time set by Samuel: but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.9'>Saul said, "Bring here the burnt offering to me, and the peace offerings." He offered the burnt offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.10'>It came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.11'>Samuel said, "What have you done?"Saul said, "Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.12'>therefore I said, 'Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal, and I haven't entreated the favor of the Lord.' I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt offering."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.13'>Samuel said to Saul, "You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of the Lord your God, which he commanded you; for now the Lord would have established your kingdom on Israel forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.14'>But now your kingdom shall not continue. The Lord has sought for himself a man after his own heart, and the Lord has appointed him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept that which the Lord commanded you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.15'>Samuel arose, and went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.16'>Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.17'>The spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.18'>and another company turned the way to Beth Horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looks down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.19'>Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, "Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears";</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.20'>but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his plowshare, mattock, axe, and sickle;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.21'>yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the plowshares, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.22'>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.23'>The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.1'>Now it fell on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, "Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side." But he did not tell his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.2'>Saul stayed in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people who were with him were about six hundred men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.3'>and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the Lord in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. The people did not know that Jonathan was gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.4'>Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.5'>The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.6'>Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, "Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that the Lord will work for us; for there is no restraint on the Lord to save by many or by few."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.7'>His armor bearer said to him, "Do all that is in your heart. Turn and, behold, I am with you according to your heart."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.8'>Then Jonathan said, "Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will reveal ourselves to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.9'>If they say thus to us, 'Wait until we come to you!' then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.10'>But if they say this, 'Come up to us!' then we will go up; for the Lord has delivered them into our hand. This shall be the sign to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.11'>Both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, "Behold, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.12'>The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, "Come up to us, and we will show you something!"Jonathan said to his armor bearer, "Come up after me; for the Lord has delivered them into the hand of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.13'>Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer killed them after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.14'>That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.15'>There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.16'>The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away, and scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.17'>Then Saul said to the people who were with him, "Count now, and see who is missing from us." When they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.18'>Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God here." For the ark of God was with the children of Israel at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.19'>It happened, while Saul talked to the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.20'>Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow: a very great confusion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.21'>Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before, and who went up with them into the camp, from all around, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.22'>Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed closely after them in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.23'>So the Lord saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth Aven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.24'>The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, "Cursed is the man who eats any food until it is evening, and I am avenged of my enemies." So none of the people tasted food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.25'>All the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.26'>When the people had come to the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.27'>But Jonathan did not hear when his father commanded the people with the oath: therefore he put forth the end of the rod who was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.28'>Then one of the people answered, and said, "Your father directly commanded the people with an oath, saying, 'Cursed is the man who eats food this day.'" The people were faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.29'>Then Jonathan said, "My father has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.30'>How much more, if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? For now has there been no great slaughter among the Philistines."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.31'>They struck of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. The people were very faint;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.32'>and the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and cattle, and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.33'>Then they told Saul, saying, "Behold, the people are sinning against the Lord, in that they eat meat with the blood."He said, "You have dealt treacherously. Roll a large stone to me this day!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.34'>Saul said, "Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them, 'Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and kill them here, and eat; and do not sin against the Lord in eating meat with the blood.'" All the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and killed them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.35'>Saul built an altar to the Lord. This was the first altar that he built to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.36'>Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them."They said, "Do whatever seems good to you."Then the priest said, "Let us draw near here to God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.37'>Saul asked counsel of God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?" But he did not answer him that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.38'>Saul said, "Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people; and know and see in which this sin has been this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.39'>For, as the Lord lives, who saves Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die." But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.40'>Then he said to all Israel, "You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side."The people said to Saul, "Do what seems good to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.41'>Therefore Saul said to the Lord, the God of Israel, "Show the right."Jonathan and Saul were chosen; but the people escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.42'>Saul said, "Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son."Jonathan was selected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.43'>Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done!"Jonathan told him, and said, "I certainly did taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold, I must die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.44'>Saul said, "God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.45'>The people said to Saul, "Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As the Lord lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day!" So the people rescued Jonathan, that he did not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.46'>Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.47'>Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he defeated them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.48'>He did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.49'>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.50'>and the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.51'>Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.52'>There was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him to him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.4'>Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.5'>Saul came to the city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.6'>Saul said to the Kenites, "Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt." So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.9'>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the cattle, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and wouldn't utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.10'>Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.11'>"It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments." Samuel was angry; and he cried to the Lord all night.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.26'>Samuel said to Saul, "I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.27'>As Samuel turned about to go away, Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe, and it tore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.28'>Samuel said to him, "The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.5'>for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine, and the Lord worked a great victory for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.6'>Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, "As the Lord lives, he shall not be put to death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.7'>Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.8'>There was war again. David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.9'>An evil spirit from the Lord was on Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.10'>Saul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he stuck the spear into the wall. David fled, and escaped that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.11'>Saul sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to kill him in the morning. Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, "If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.12'>So Michal let David down through the window. He went, fled, and escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.13'>Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair at its head, and covered it with the clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.14'>When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, "He is sick."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.15'>Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, "Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.16'>When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats' hair at its head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.17'>Saul said to Michal, "Why have you deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that he is escaped?"Michal answered Saul, "He said to me, 'Let me go! Why should I kill you?'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.18'>Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and lived in Naioth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.19'>It was told Saul, saying, "Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.20'>Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.21'>When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.22'>Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?"One said, "Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.23'>He went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then the Spirit of God came on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.24'>He also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.20'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.1'>David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, "What have I done? What is my iniquity? What is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.2'>He said to him, "Far from it; you shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it to me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.3'>David swore moreover, and said, "Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes; and he says, 'Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved:' but truly as the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.4'>Then Jonathan said to David, "Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.5'>David said to Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to dine with the king; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.6'>If your father miss me at all, then say, 'David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.7'>If he says, 'It is well;' your servant shall have peace: but if he be angry, then know that evil is determined by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.8'>Therefore deal kindly with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the Lord with you: but if there is iniquity in me, kill me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.9'>Jonathan said, "Far be it from you; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come on you, then wouldn't I tell you that?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.10'>Then David said to Jonathan, "Who shall tell me if perchance your father answers you roughly?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.11'>Jonathan said to David, "Come, and let us go out into the field." They both went out into the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.12'>Jonathan said to David, "By the Lord, the God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if there is good toward David, shall I not then send to you, and disclose it to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.13'>The Lord do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do you evil, if I do not disclose it to you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and the Lord be with you, as he has been with my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.14'>You shall not only while yet I live show me the loving kindness of the Lord, that I not die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.15'>but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever; no, not when the Lord has cut off the enemies of David everyone from the surface of the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.16'>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "The Lord will require it at the hand of David's enemies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.17'>Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.18'>Then Jonathan said to him, "Tomorrow is the new moon: and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.19'>When you have stayed three days, you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you hid yourself when this started, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.20'>I will shoot three arrows on its side, as though I shot at a mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.21'>Behold, I will send the boy, saying, 'Go, find the arrows!' If I tell the boy, 'Behold, the arrows are on this side of you. Take them;' then come; for there is peace to you and no hurt, as the Lord lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.22'>But if I say this to the boy, 'Behold, the arrows are beyond you;' then go your way; for the Lord has sent you away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.23'>Concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, the Lord is between you and me forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.24'>So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon had come, the king sat him down to eat food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.25'>The king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side: but David's place was empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.26'>Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day: for he thought, "Something has happened to him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.27'>It happened on the next day after the new moon, the second day, that David's place was empty. Saul said to Jonathan his son, "Why doesn't the son of Jesse come to eat, neither yesterday, nor today?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.28'>Jonathan answered Saul, "David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.29'>He said, 'Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city. My brother has commanded me to be there. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go away and see my brothers.' Therefore he has not come to the king's table."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.30'>Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, "You son of a perverse rebellious woman, do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.31'>For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.32'>Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.33'>Saul cast his spear at him to strike him. By this Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.34'>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.35'>It happened in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.36'>He said to his boy, "Run, find now the arrows which I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.37'>When the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, "Isn't the arrow beyond you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.38'>Jonathan cried after the boy, "Go fast! Hurry! Do not delay!" Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.39'>But the boy did not know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.40'>Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, "Go, carry them to the city."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.41'>As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. They kissed one another, and wept one with another, and David wept the most.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.42'>Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, because we have both sworn in the name of the Lord, saying, 'The Lord shall be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed, forever.'" He arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.21'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.1'>Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, "Why are you alone, and no man with you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.2'>David said to Ahimelech the priest, "The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me, 'Let no man know anything of the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you; and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.3'>Now therefore what is under your hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.4'>The priest answered David, and said, "There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.5'>David answered the priest, and said to him, "Truly, women have been kept from us about these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.6'>So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread, that was taken from before the Lord, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.7'>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the Lord; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.8'>David said to Ahimelech, "Isn't there here under your hand spear or sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.9'>The priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it; for there is no other except that here."David said, "There is none like that. Give it to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.10'>David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.11'>The servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David the king of the land? Did they not sing one to another about him in dances, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands?'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.12'>David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.13'>He changed his behavior before them, and pretended to be mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.14'>Then Achish said to his servants, "Look, you see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.15'>Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.22'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.1'>David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.2'>Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented, gathered themselves to him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.3'>David went there to Mizpeh of Moab, and he said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and my mother come out with you, until I know what God will do for me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.4'>He brought them before the king of Moab; and they lived with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.5'>The prophet Gad said to David, "Do not stay in the stronghold. Depart, and go into the land of Judah."Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.6'>Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.7'>Saul said to his servants who stood about him, "Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.13'>Saul said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.14'>Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, "Who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and is taken into your council, and is honorable in your house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.15'>Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? Be it far from me! Do not let the king impute anything to his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for your servant knows nothing of all this, less or more."</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.5'>David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.14'>David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.28'>So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela Hammahlekoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.29'>David went up from there, and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.24'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.1'>It happened, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, "Behold, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.2'>Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.3'>He came to the sheep pens by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.4'>The men of David said to him, "Behold, the day of which the Lord said to you, 'Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.'" Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.5'>It happened afterward, that David's heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.6'>He said to his men, "The Lord forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the Lord's anointed, to put forth my hand against him, since he is the Lord's anointed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.7'>So David checked his men with these words, and did not allow them to rise against Saul. Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.8'>David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, "My lord the king!"When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and showed respect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.9'>David said to Saul, "Why do you listen to men's words, saying, 'Behold, David seeks your hurt?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.10'>Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that the Lord had delivered you today into my hand in the cave. Some urged me to kill you; but I spared you; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is the Lord's anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.11'>Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and did not kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you hunt for my life to take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.12'>May the Lord judge between me and you, and may the Lord avenge me of you; but my hand shall not be on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.13'>As the proverb of the ancients says, 'Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness;' but my hand shall not be on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.14'>Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.15'>May the Lord therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.16'>It came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.17'>He said to David, "You are more righteous than I; for you have done good to me, whereas I have done evil to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.18'>You have declared this day how you have dealt well with me, because when the Lord had delivered me up into your hand, you did not kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.19'>For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed? Therefore may the Lord reward you good for that which you have done to me this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.20'>Now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.21'>Swear now therefore to me by the Lord, that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.22'>David swore to Saul. Saul went home; but David and his men went up to the stronghold.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.25'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.1'>Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.2'>There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.3'>Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful face: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.4'>David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.5'>David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, "Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.6'>You shall tell him, 'Long life to you! Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.7'>Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds have now been with us, and we did not hurt them, neither was there anything missing from them, all the while they were in Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.8'>Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come in a good day. Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants, and to your son David.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.9'>When David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.10'>Nabal answered David's servants, and said, "Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants who break away from their masters these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.11'>Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who I do not know where they come from?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.12'>So David's young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.13'>David said to his men, "Every man put on his sword!"Every man put on his sword. David also put on his sword. About four hundred men followed David; and two hundred stayed by the baggage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.14'>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, "Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to Greet our master; and he railed at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.15'>But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.16'>They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.17'>Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house; for he is such a worthless fellow that one can't speak to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.18'>Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two bottles of wine, five sheep ready dressed, five measures of parched grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.19'>She said to her young men, "Go on before me. Behold, I come after you." But she did not tell her husband, Nabal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.20'>It was so, as she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.21'>Now David had said, "Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him. He has returned me evil for good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.22'>God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.23'>When Abigail saw David, she hurried, and got off from her donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.24'>She fell at his feet, and said, "On me, my lord, on me be the iniquity; and please let your handmaid speak in your ears. Hear the words of your handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.25'>Please do not let my lord regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I, your handmaid, did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.26'>Now therefore, my lord, as the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, since the Lord has withheld you from blood guiltiness, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore let your enemies, and those who seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.27'>Now this present which your servant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.28'>Please forgive the trespass of your handmaid. For the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fights the battles of the Lord; and evil shall not be found in you all your days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.29'>Though men may rise up to pursue you, and to seek your soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord your God. He will sling out the souls of your enemies, as from the hollow of a sling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.30'>It shall come to pass, when the Lord has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and shall have appointed you prince over Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.31'>that this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. When the Lord has dealt well with my lord, then remember your handmaid."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.32'>David said to Abigail, "Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.33'>Blessed is your discretion, and blessed are you, that have kept me this day from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.34'>For indeed, as the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, who has withheld me from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, surely there wouldn't have been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.35'>So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said to her, "Go up in peace to your house. Behold, I have listened to your voice, and have granted your request."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.36'>Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken. Therefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.37'>It happened in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.38'>It happened about ten days after, that the Lord struck Nabal, so that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.39'>When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Blessed is the Lord, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil. The Lord has returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head." David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to him as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.40'>When the servants of David had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, "David has sent us to you, to take you to him as wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.41'>She arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, "Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.42'>Abigail hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five ladies of hers who followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.43'>David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they both became his wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.44'>Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.26'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.1'>The Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, "Doesn't David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.2'>Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.3'>Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.4'>David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had certainly come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.5'>David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army: and Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.6'>Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, "Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?"Abishai said, "I will go down with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.7'>So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.8'>Then Abishai said to David, "God has delivered up your enemy into your hand this day. Now therefore please let me strike him with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.9'>David said to Abishai, "Do not destroy him; for who can put forth his hand against the Lord's anointed, and be guiltless?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.10'>David said, "As the Lord lives, the Lord will strike him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.11'>The Lord forbid that I should put forth my hand against the Lord's anointed; but now please take the spear that is at his head, and the jar of water, and let us go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.12'>So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head; and they went away: and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.13'>Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.14'>and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, "Do you not answer, Abner?"Then Abner answered, "Who are you who cries to the king?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.15'>David said to Abner, "Aren't you a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord, the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.16'>This thing isn't good that you have done. As the Lord lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the Lord's anointed. Now see where the king's spear is, and the jar of water that was at his head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.17'>Saul knew David's voice, and said, "Is this your voice, my son David?"David said, "It is my voice, my lord, O king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.18'>He said, "Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.19'>Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is so that the Lord has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering. But if it is the children of men, they are cursed before the Lord; for they have driven me out this day that I shouldn't cling to the Lord's inheritance, saying, 'Go, serve other gods!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.20'>Now therefore, do not let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the Lord; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.21'>Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Return, my son David; for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.22'>David answered, "Behold the spear, O king! Then let one of the young men come over and get it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.23'>The Lord will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; because the Lord delivered you into my hand today, and I wouldn't put forth my hand against the Lord's anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.24'>Behold, as your life was respected this day in my eyes, so let my life be respected in the eyes of the Lord, and let him deliver me out of all oppression."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.25'>Then Saul said to David, "You are blessed, my son David. You shall both do mightily, and shall surely prevail." So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.</verse>

So shall I escape out of his hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.2'>David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.8'>David and his men went up, and made a raid on the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.9'>David struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the cattle, and the donkeys, and the camels, and the clothing; and he returned, and came to Achish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.18'>Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord, and did not execute his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore the Lord has done this thing to you this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.19'>Moreover the Lord will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The Lord will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.20'>Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth, and was terrified, because of the words of Samuel. There was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.21'>The woman came to Saul, and saw that he was very troubled, and said to him, "Behold, your handmaid has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.22'>Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.23'>But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened to their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat on the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.24'>The woman had a fattened calf in the house. She hurried and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.25'>She brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.29'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.1'>Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is in Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.2'>The lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.3'>Then the princes of the Philistines said, "What about these Hebrews?"Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, "Isn't this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or rather these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away to this day?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.4'>But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, "Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For with what should this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Should it not be with the heads of these men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.5'>Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands?'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.6'>Then Achish called David, and said to him, "As the Lord lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless, the lords do not favor you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.7'>Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you not displease the lords of the Philistines."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.8'>David said to Achish, "But what have I done? What have you found in your servant so long as I have been before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.9'>Achish answered David, "I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God. Notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, 'He shall not go up with us to the battle.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.10'>Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you; and as soon as you are up early in the morning, and have light, depart."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.11'>So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. The Philistines went up to Jezreel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.30'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.1'>It happened, when David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negev, and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and burned it with fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.2'>and had taken captive the women and all who were therein, both small and great. They did not kill any, but carried them off, and went their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.3'>When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.4'>Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.5'>David's two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.6'>David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in the Lord his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.7'>David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, "Please bring me here the ephod."Abiathar brought the ephod to David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.8'>David inquired of the Lord, saying, "If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them?"He answered him, "Pursue; for you shall surely overtake them, and shall without fail recover all."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.9'>So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.10'>But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn't go over the brook Besor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.11'>They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.12'>They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.13'>David asked him, "To whom do you belong? Where are you from?"He said, "I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.14'>We made a raid on the South of the Kerethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the Negev of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.15'>David said to him, "Will you bring me down to this troop?"He said, "Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.16'>When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread around over all the ground, eating, drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.17'>David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped from there, except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.18'>David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.19'>There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them. David brought back all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.20'>David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other livestock, and said, "This is David's spoil."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.21'>David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to stay at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him. When David came near to the people, he greeted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.22'>Then all the wicked men and base fellows, of those who went with David, answered and said, "Because they did not go with us, we will not give them anything of the spoil that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.23'>Then David said, "You shall not do so, my brothers, with that which the Lord has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.24'>Who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who tarries by the baggage: they shall share alike."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.25'>It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.26'>When David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, "Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.27'>He sent it to those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth of the Negev, and to those who were in Jattir,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.28'>and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.29'>and to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.30'>and to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Borashan, and to those who were in Athach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.31'>and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men used to stay.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.31'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.1'>Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.2'>The Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.3'>The battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.4'>Then Saul said to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me!" But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.5'>When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.6'>So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same day together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.7'>When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.8'>It happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.9'>They cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the news to the house of their idols, and to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.10'>They put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.11'>When the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.12'>all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.13'>They took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</verse>
