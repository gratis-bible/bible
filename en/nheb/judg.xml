      <chapter osisID='Judg.1'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.1'>It happened after the death of Joshua, the children of Israel asked of the Lord, saying, "Who should go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.2'>The Lord said, "Judah shall go up. Behold, I have delivered the land into his hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.3'>Judah said to Simeon his brother, "Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot." So Simeon went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.4'>Judah went up; and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they struck of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.5'>They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.6'>But Adoni-Bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.7'>Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, scavenged under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me." They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.8'>The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.9'>Afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, and in the South, and in the lowland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.10'>Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba); and they struck Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.11'>From there he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (Now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.12'>Caleb said, "He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.13'>Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.14'>It happened, when she came to him, that she got him to ask her father for a field: and she got off from her donkey; and Caleb said to her, "What would you like?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.15'>She said to him, "Give me a blessing; since you have given me the land in the Negev, give me also springs of water." Then Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.16'>The children of the Kenite, Moses' brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.17'>Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. The name of the city was called Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.18'>Also Judah took Gaza with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.19'>The Lord was with Judah; and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.20'>They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had spoken: and he drove out there the three sons of Anak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.21'>The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.22'>The house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel; and the Lord was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.23'>The house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.24'>The watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said to him, "Please show us the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.25'>He showed them the entrance into the city; and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go and all his family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.26'>The man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.27'>Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its towns, nor Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.28'>It happened, when Israel had grown strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and did not utterly drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.29'>Ephraim didn't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer; but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.30'>Zebulun didn't drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived among them, and became subject to forced labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.31'>Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.32'>but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.33'>Naphtali didn't drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but he lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to forced labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.34'>The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country; for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.35'>but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to forced labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.36'>The border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.2'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.1'>The angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim. He said, "I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.2'>and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars.' But you have not listened to my voice: why have you done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.3'>Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.4'>It happened, when the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.5'>They called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.6'>Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.7'>The people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the Lord that he had worked for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.8'>Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being one hundred ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.9'>They buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.10'>Also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, who didn't know the Lord, nor yet the work which he had worked for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.11'>The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and served the Baals;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.12'>and they forsook the Lord, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them: and they provoked the Lord to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.13'>They forsook the Lord, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.14'>The anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers who despoiled them; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.15'>Wherever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for harm, as the Lord had spoken, and as the Lord had sworn to them: and they were sore distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.16'>The Lord raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who despoiled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.17'>Yet they did not listen to their judges; for they played the prostitute after other gods, and bowed themselves down to them: they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of the Lord; but they did not do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.18'>When the Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it grieved the Lord because of their groaning by reason of those who oppressed them and troubled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.19'>But it happened, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they did not cease from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.20'>The anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel; and he said, "Because this nation have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.21'>I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.22'>that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein, as their fathers kept it, or not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.23'>So the Lord left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.3'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.1'>Now these are the nations which the Lord left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.2'>only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.3'>namely, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.4'>They were left, to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.5'>The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.6'>and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.7'>The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and forgot the Lord their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.8'>Therefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.9'>When the children of Israel cried to the Lord, the Lord raised up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.10'>The Spirit of the Lord came on him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and the Lord delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.11'>The land had rest forty years. Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.12'>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.13'>He gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.14'>The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.15'>But when the children of Israel cried to the Lord, the Lord raised them up a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed. The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.16'>Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his clothing on his right thigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.17'>He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.18'>When he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people who bore the tribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.19'>But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, "I have a secret message for you, king."The king said, "Keep silence!" All who stood by him went out from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.20'>Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, "I have a message from God to you." He arose out of his seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.21'>Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.22'>and the handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn't draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.23'>Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.24'>Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, "Surely he is covering his feet in the upper room."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.25'>They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he did not open the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened them, and behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.26'>Ehud escaped while they waited, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.27'>It happened, when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.28'>He said to them, "Follow after me; for the Lord has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand." They went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and did not allow a man to pass over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.29'>They struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.30'>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. The land had rest eighty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.31'>After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck of the Philistines six hundred men with an oxgoad: and he also saved Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.4'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.1'>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, when Ehud was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.2'>The Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.3'>The children of Israel cried to the Lord: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.4'>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.5'>She lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.6'>She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, "Hasn't the Lord, the God of Israel, commanded, 'Go and draw to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.7'>I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.8'>Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.9'>She said, "I will surely go with you: nevertheless, the journey that you take shall not be for your honor; for the Lord will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman." Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.10'>Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.11'>Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.12'>They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.13'>Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.14'>Deborah said to Barak, "Go; for this is the day in which the Lord has delivered Sisera into your hand. Hasn't the Lord gone out before you?" So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.15'>The Lord confused Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera got off from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.16'>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.17'>However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.18'>Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, "Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; do not be afraid." He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.19'>He said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty."She opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.20'>He said to her, "Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man comes and inquires of you, and says, 'Is there any man here?' that you shall say, 'No.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.21'>Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.22'>Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek." He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.23'>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.24'>The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.5'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.1'>Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.2'>"Because the leaders took the lead in Israel,because the people offered themselves willingly,be blessed, Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.3'>"Hear, you kings!Give ear, you princes!I, even I, will sing to the Lord.I will sing praise to the Lord, the God of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.7.2'>The Lord said to Gideon, "The people who are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, 'My own hand has saved me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.3'>Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, 'Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.' There returned of the people twenty-two thousand; but ten thousand remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.4'>The Lord said to Gideon, "The people are yet too many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for you there: and it shall be, that of whom I tell you, This shall go with you, the same shall go with you; and of whoever I tell you, This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.5'>So he brought down the people to the water: and the Lord said to Gideon, "Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, him you shall set by himself; likewise everyone who kneels down on his knees to drink."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.6'>The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: but all the rest of the people kneeled down on their knees to drink water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.7'>The Lord said to Gideon, "By the three hundred men who lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand; and let all the people go every man to his home."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.8'>So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men. And the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.7.12'>The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as numerous as the sand which is on the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.13'>When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his friend; and he said, "Behold, I had a dream, and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent collapsed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.14'>His friend answered, "This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. Into his hand God has delivered Midian, and all the army."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.15'>It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and its interpretation, that he worshiped, and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, "Get up, for the Lord has delivered into your hand the army of Midian."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.16'>He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.17'>He said to them, "Look at me, and do likewise. And behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so you shall do.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.7.19'>So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.20'>The three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow; and they called out, "The sword of the Lord and of Gideon.'"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.7.22'>They blew the three hundred trumpets, and the Lord set every man's sword against his fellow, and against all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.23'>The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.24'>Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down against Midian, and capture the waters, as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan." So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and seized the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.25'>They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.9.2'>"Please speak in the ears of all the men of Shechem, 'Is it better for you that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you?' Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.3'>His mother's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, "He is our brother."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.4'>They gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal Berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.5'>He went to his father's house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.6'>All the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.7'>When they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said to them, "Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God may listen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.8'>The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, 'Reign you over us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.9'>"But the olive tree said to them, 'Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.10'>"The trees said to the fig tree, 'Come, and reign over us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.11'>"But the fig tree said to them, 'Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.12'>"The trees said to the vine, 'Come, and reign over us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.13'>"The vine said to them, 'Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.14'>"Then all the trees said to the bramble, 'Come, and reign over us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.15'>"The bramble said to the trees, 'If in truth you anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.16'>"Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and righteously, in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.17'>(for my father fought for you, and adventured his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.18'>and you are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy persons, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.19'>If you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice you in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.20'>but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.21'>And Jotham escaped and fled and went to Beer and lived there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.22'>Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.23'>God sent a spirit of hostility between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.24'>that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.25'>The men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who came along that way by them. And it was told to Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.26'>Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.27'>They went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.28'>Gaal the son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Isn't he the son of Jerubbaal, and Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem. But why should we serve him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.29'>Would that this people were under my hand! Then would I remove Abimelech." He said to Abimelech, "Increase your army, and come out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.30'>When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.31'>He sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, "Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers are come to Shechem; and behold, they constrain the city to take part against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.32'>Now therefore, rise up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.33'>And it shall be that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early, and rush on the city. And behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, then do whatever you can to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.34'>Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night, and they lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.35'>Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people who were with him, from the ambush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.36'>When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, "Behold, there are people coming down from the tops of the mountains."Zebul said to him, "You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.37'>Gaal spoke again and said, "Behold, there are people coming down by the central part of the land, and one company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.38'>Then Zebul said to him, "Where is now your mouth, that you said, 'Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?' Is not this the people that you have despised? Please go out now and fight with them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.39'>Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.40'>Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.41'>Abimelech lived at Arumah: and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.42'>It happened on the next day, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.43'>He took the people, and divided them into three companies, and waited in ambush in the field; and he looked, and behold, the people came forth out of the city. He rose up against them, and struck them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.44'>Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two companies rushed against all who were in the field, and struck them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.45'>Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and killed the people who were in it. And he destroyed the city, and sowed it with salt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.46'>When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the house of El Berith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.47'>It was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.48'>Abimelech got him up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a branch from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the people who were with him, "What you have seen me do, do quickly, and do as I have done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.49'>All the people likewise cut down his branch and followed Abimelech, and put them on the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire on them; so that all the men of the Tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.50'>Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.51'>But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women fled, and all those of the city, and shut themselves in, and got them up to the roof of the tower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.52'>Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.53'>A certain woman threw down an upper millstone on Abimelech's head, and broke his skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.54'>Then he called quickly to the young man his armor bearer, and said to him, "Draw your sword, and kill me, that men not say of me, 'A woman killed him.'" So the young man thrust him through, and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.55'>When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.56'>Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in killing his seventy brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.57'>and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God return on their heads, and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.10'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.1'>After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.2'>He judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.3'>After him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty-two years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.4'>He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth Jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.5'>Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.6'>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and served the Baals, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook the Lord, and did not serve him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.7'>The anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.8'>They troubled and oppressed the children of Israel that year. Eighteen years they oppressed all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.9'>The children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was very distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.10'>The children of Israel cried to the Lord, saying, "We have sinned against you, even because we have forsaken our God, and have served the Baals."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.11'>The Lord said to the children of Israel, "Did I not save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.12'>The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.13'>Yet you have forsaken me, and served other gods. Therefore I will save you no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.14'>Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.15'>The children of Israel said to the Lord, "We have sinned. Do to us whatever seems good to you; only deliver us, please, this day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.16'>They put away the foreign gods from among them, and served the Lord; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.17'>Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. The children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped at Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.18'>The people, the rulers of Gilead, said to each other, "What man is he who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.11'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.1'>Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a prostitute. And Gilead became the father of Jephthah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.2'>Gilead's wife bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said to him, "You shall not inherit in our father's house; for you are the son of another woman."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.3'>Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and lived in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.4'>It happened after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.5'>It was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.6'>and they said to Jephthah, "Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.7'>Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "Did you not hate me, and drive me out of my father's house? And why have you come to me now when you are in distress?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.8'>The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "Therefore we have turned again to you now, that you may go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon; and you shall be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.9'>Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and the Lord delivers them before me, shall I be your head?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.10'>The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "The Lord shall be witness between us; surely according to your word so will we do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.11'>Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them. And Jephthah spoke all his words before the Lord in Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.12'>Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, "What have you to do with me, that you are come to me to fight against my land?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.13'>The king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, "Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan. Now therefore restore it peaceably."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.14'>Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.15'>and he said to him, "Thus says Jephthah: 'Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.16'>but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.17'>then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Please let me pass through your land.' But the king of Edom did not listen. In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab; but he would not. So Israel stayed in Kadesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.18'>Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they did not come within the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the boundary of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.19'>Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, "Please let us pass through your land to our land.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.20'>But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.21'>The Lord, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them. So Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.22'>They possessed all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.23'>So now the Lord, the God of Israel, has driven out the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.24'>Won't you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever the Lord our God has driven out from before us, we will possess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.25'>And now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever contend against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.26'>While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; why did you not recover them within that time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.27'>I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong by making war against me. The Lord, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.28'>However the king of the children of Ammon did not listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.29'>Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.30'>Jephthah made a vow to the Lord, and said, "If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.31'>then it shall be that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be the Lord's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.32'>So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the Lord delivered them into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.33'>He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.34'>Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.35'>It happened, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, "Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have given my word to the Lord, and I can't break it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.36'>She said to him, "My father, since you have given your word to the Lord; do to me as you promised, because the Lord has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, even on the children of Ammon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.37'>She said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me: leave me alone two months, that I may depart and go down on the mountains, and weep because of my virginity, I and my companions."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.38'>He said, "Go." He sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and wept because of her virginity on the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.39'>It happened at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to what he had vowed. And she was a virgin. It became a custom in Israel,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.12.4'>Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, "You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.5'>The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. It was so, that when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, "Let me go over," the men of Gilead said to him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" If he said, "No";</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.6'>then they said to him, "Now say 'Shibboleth;'" and he said "Sibboleth"; for he couldn't manage to pronounce it right: then they seized him, and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. There fell at that time of Ephraim forty-two thousand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.13.1'>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.2'>There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and did not bear. .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.3'>The angel of the Lord appeared to the woman, and said to her, "See now, you are barren, and do not bear; but you shall conceive, and bear a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.4'>Now therefore please be careful and drink no wine nor strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.5'>For behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb. And he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.6'>Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, "A man of God came to me, and his face was like the face of the angel of God, very awesome; and I didn't ask him where he was from, neither did he tell me his name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.7'>but he said to me, 'Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son. And now drink no wine nor strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb until the day of his death.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.8'>Then Manoah entreated the Lord, and said, "Oh, Lord, please let the man of God whom you did send come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child who shall be born."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.9'>God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah, her husband, wasn't with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.10'>The woman ran quickly, and told her husband, and said to him, "Behold, the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.11'>Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, "Are you the man who spoke to the woman?" He said, "I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.12'>Manoah said, "Now let your words happen. How shall the child be raised and what is he to do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.13'>The angel of the Lord said to Manoah, "Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.14'>She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. All that I have commanded her she is to observe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.15'>Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, "Please, stay a bit longer that we may prepare a young goat for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.16'>The angel of the Lord said to Manoah, "Though you detain me, I won't eat of your bread. And if you prepare a burnt offering, you must offer it to the Lord." For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.17'>Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, "What is your name, that when your words come true we may honor you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.18'>And the angel of the Lord said to him, "Why do you ask for my name? It is incomprehensible."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.19'>So Manoah took the young goat and a grain offering, and offered it on the rock to the Lord, who works wonders. Then the angel did a wonderful thing as Manoah and his wife looked on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.20'>For it happened, when the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar, that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on, and they fell on their faces to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.21'>But the angel of the Lord did not appear again to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.22'>Manoah said to his wife, :We shall surely die, because we have seen God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.23'>But his wife said to him, "If the Lord meant to kill us, he wouldn't have received a burnt offering and a grain offering from us, neither would he have shown us all these things, nor would he have spoken to us now like this."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.24'>The woman bore a son, and named him Samson. And the child grew, and the Lord blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.25'>And the Spirit of the Lord began to direct him in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.14'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.1'>Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.2'>He came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, "I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. Now therefore get her for me as wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.3'>Then his father and his mother said to him, "Is there not a woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?" And Samson said to his father, "Get her for me, for she is the right one for me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.4'>But his father and his mother did not know that it was of the Lord, for he sought for an opportunity against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.5'>Then Samson went down with his father and his mother to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold, a young lion roared against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.6'>And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and he tore him as he would have torn a young goat. And he had nothing in his hand, but he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.7'>He went down and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.8'>After a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.9'>He took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went. And he came to his father and mother, and gave to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.10'>His father went down to the woman, and Samson made a feast there, since young men used to do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.11'>It happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.12'>Samson said to them, "Let me now put forth a riddle to you. If you can explain it to me within the seven days of the feast, and figure it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.13'>But if you can't explain it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing." And they said to him, "Propose your riddle, we want to hear it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.14'>He said to them,"Out of the eater came forth food.Out of the strong came forth sweetness."They couldn't in three days declare the riddle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.15'>And it happened on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, "Entice your husband, that he may tell us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you called us to impoverish us? Is it not so?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.16'>Samson's wife wept before him, and said, "You just hate me, and do not love me. You have put forth a riddle to the children of my people, and haven't told it me."And he said to her, "Behold, I haven't told it to my father or my mother, and shall I tell you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.17'>She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it happened on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.18'>The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?"He said to them,"If you hadn't plowed with my heifer,you wouldn't have found out my riddle."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.19'>The Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and struck thirty men of them, and took their belongings, and gave their garments to those who explained the riddle. His anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.20'>But Samson's wife was given to his companion, who had been his friend.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.15'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.1'>But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a young goat; and he said, "I will go in to my wife into the room."But her father wouldn't allow him to go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.2'>Her father said, "I most certainly thought that you had utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion. Isn't her younger sister more beautiful than she is? Please take her, instead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.3'>Samson said to them, "This time I will be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I harm them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.4'>Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the midst between every two tails.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.5'>When he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.6'>Then the Philistines said, "Who has done this?" They said, "Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife, and given her to his companion." The Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.7'>Samson said to them, "If you behave like this, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.8'>He struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.9'>Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.10'>The men of Judah said, "Why have you come up against us?" They said, "We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.11'>Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, "Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?"He said to them, "As they did to me, so have I done to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.12'>They said to him, "We have come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines."Samson said to them, "Swear to me that you will not fall on me yourselves."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.13'>They spoke to him, saying, "No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand; but surely we will not kill you." They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.14'>When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.15'>And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and reached down and took it, and struck a thousand men with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.16'>Samson said, "With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps; with the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a thousand men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.17'>It happened, when he had finished speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath Lehi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.18'>He was very thirsty, and called on the Lord, and said, "You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.19'>And God split the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came out of it. When he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: therefore its name was called En Hakore, which is in Lehi, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.20'>He judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.16'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.1'>Samson went to Gaza, and saw a prostitute there, and went in to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.2'>The Gazites were told, "Samson is here!" They surrounded him, and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city, and were quiet all night, saying, "Wait until morning light, then we will kill him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.3'>Samson stayed in bed until midnight, and arose at midnight, and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is overlooking Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.4'>It came to pass afterward, that he fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.5'>The lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, "Entice him, and see in which his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.6'>Delilah said to Samson, "Please tell me where your great strength lies, and how you can be bound and subdued."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.7'>Samson said to her, "If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.8'>Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.9'>Now she had an ambush waiting in the inner room. She said to him, "The Philistines are on you, Samson!" He broke the cords, as a string of tow is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.10'>Delilah said to Samson, "Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies: now please tell me with which you might be bound."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.11'>He said to her, "If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.12'>So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said to him, "The Philistines are on you, Samson!" The ambush was waiting in the inner room. He broke them off his arms like a thread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.13'>Delilah said to Samson, "Until now, you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with what you might be bound."He said to her, "If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.14'>She fastened it with the pin, and said to him, "The Philistines are on you, Samson!" He awakened out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.15'>She said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great strength lies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.16'>It happened, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was troubled to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.17'>He told her all his heart, and said to her, "No razor has ever come on my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I will become weak, and be like any other man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.18'>When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, "Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart." Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the money in their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.19'>She made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.20'>She said, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!"He awoke out of his sleep, and said, "I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free." But he didn't know that the Lord had departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.21'>The Philistines seized him, and put out his eyes. And they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with bronze shackles, and he ground at the mill in the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.22'>However the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.23'>The lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to celebrate; for they said, "Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.24'>When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, "Our god has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us, into our hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.25'>It happened, when their hearts were merry, that they said, "Call for Samson, that he may entertain us." They called for Samson out of the prison; and he performed before them. They set him between the pillars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.26'>and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand, "Allow me to feel the pillars whereupon the house rests, that I may lean on them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.27'>Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women, who saw while Samson made sport.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.28'>Samson called to the Lord, and said, "Lord God, please remember me, and please strengthen me only this once, God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.29'>Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and leaned on them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.30'>Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" He bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people who were therein. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than those who he killed in his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.31'>Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah his father. He judged Israel twenty years.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.17'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.1'>There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.2'>He said to his mother, "The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it."His mother said, "Blessed be my son of the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.3'>He restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, "I most certainly dedicate the silver to the Lord from my hand for my son, to make an engraved image and a molten image. Now therefore I will restore it to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.4'>When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made of it an engraved image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.5'>The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.6'>In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.7'>There was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he lived there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.8'>The man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah, to live where he could find a place, and he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he traveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.9'>Micah said to him, "Where did you come from?"He said to him, "I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah, and I am looking for a place to live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.10'>Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver by the year, and a suit of clothing, and your food. So the Levite went in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.11'>The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.12'>Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.13'>Then Micah said, "Now I know that the Lord will do good to me, seeing I have a Levite as my priest."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.18'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.1'>In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was looking for an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day, their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.2'>The children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, "Go, explore the land!" They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.3'>When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned in that direction, and said to him, "Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? And what is your business here?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.4'>He said to them, "Thus and so has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I have become his priest."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.5'>They said to him, "Please ask counsel of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.6'>The priest said to them, "Go in peace. The Lord will watch over you on your journey."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.7'>Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people who were there, and how they lived in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was no one in the land possessing authority that might trouble them in anyway, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.8'>They came to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brothers said to them, "What do you say?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.9'>They said, "Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. Will you do nothing? Do not hesitate to go and to enter in to possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.10'>When you go, you shall come to a secure people, and the land is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no want of anything that is on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.11'>Then the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men armed with weapons of war, set forth from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.12'>They went up, and encamped in Kiriath Jearim, in Judah. Therefore they called that place Mahaneh Dan to this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath Jearim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.13'>They passed there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.14'>Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered, and said to their brothers, "Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and an engraved image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what you have to do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.15'>They turned aside there, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.16'>The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.17'>The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the engraved image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.18'>When these went into Micah's house, and took the engraved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.19'>They said to him, "Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.20'>The priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went in the midst of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.21'>So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the livestock and the goods before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.22'>When they were some distance from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.23'>They cried to the children of Dan. They turned their faces, and said to Micah, "What's wrong with you, that you come with such a company?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.24'>He said, "You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away, and what more do I have? How then do you say to me, 'What's wrong with you?'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.25'>The children of Dan said to him, "Do not let your voice be heard among us, or angry men will attack you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.26'>The children of Dan went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.27'>They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.28'>There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone, and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built the city, and lived there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.29'>They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel. However the name of the city was originally Laish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.30'>The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image. And Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the exile from the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.31'>So they set up for themselves Micah's engraved image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.19'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.1'>It happened in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim, who took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.2'>His concubine was unfaithful to him and went away from him to her father's house in Bethlehem of Judah, and was there about four months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.3'>Her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of donkeys. And she brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.4'>His father-in-law, the young lady's father, welcomed him; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank and stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.5'>It happened on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the young lady's father said to his son-in-law, "Refresh yourself with a piece of bread, and after that you may go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.6'>So they sat down, ate, and drank, both of them together. Then the young lady's father said to the man, "Please agree to stay the night, and enjoy yourself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.7'>The man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he stayed there again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.8'>He arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the young lady's father said, "Please refresh yourself and stay until the day declines." And they both ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.9'>When the man rose up with his concubine and his servant to leave, his father-in-law, the young lady's father, said to him, "Behold, now the day draws toward evening, please stay the night. Behold, the day grows to an end, stay here, and enjoy yourself; and tomorrow you can get up early for your journey so that you may go home."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.10'>But the man wouldn't stay that night, but he rose up and departed, and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). And there were with him a couple of saddled donkeys, and his concubine was also with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.11'>When they were by Jebus, the day was almost gone, and the servant said to his master, "Please come and let us stop at this city of the Jebusites, and spend the night in it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.12'>His master said to him, "We won't go into the city of a foreigner that is not of the children of Israel, but we will pass over to Gibeah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.13'>He said to his servant, "Come and let us try to reach one of those places and we will spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.14'>So they passed on and went their way; and the sun set on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.15'>They turned that way to go in to spend the night in Gibeah. And he went in and they sat down in the street of the city; for there was no one who would take them into their house to spend the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.16'>Behold, there came an old man from his work out in the field at evening. Now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim, and he was residing in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.17'>He lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, "Where are you going? Where did you come from?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.18'>He said to him, "We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim. I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem in Judah. I am going to the house of the Lord; and there is no man who will take me into his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.19'>Yet there is both straw and feed for our donkeys, and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your female servant, and for the young man who is with your servants. There is no lack of anything."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.20'>And the old man said, "Peace be to you. I will take care of all your needs; however, do not spend the night in the square."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.21'>So he brought him into his house, and fed the donkeys. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.22'>As they were enjoying themselves, behold, the men of the city, some wicked men of the city surrounded the house, beating at the door. And they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, "Bring out the man who came into your house, that we may have sex with him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.23'>The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, "No, my brothers, please do not act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house. Do not do this folly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.24'>Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. I will bring them out now. Ravish them and do with them what seems good to you; but do not do any such a disgraceful thing to this man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.25'>But the men wouldn't listen to him: so the man laid hold of his concubine, and brought her out to them. And they raped her and abused her all night until the morning, and when the day began to dawn they let her go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.26'>Then at daybreak the woman arrived and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, until daylight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.27'>Her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.28'>He said to her, "Get up, and let us go!" But no one answered. Then he took her up on the donkey; and the man rose up, and went to his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.29'>When he had come into his house, he took a knife, and took hold of his concubine and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.30'>It was so, that all who saw it said, "There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day! Consider it, take counsel, and speak."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.20'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.1'>Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to the Lord at Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.2'>The leaders of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.3'>(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) The children of Israel said, "Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.4'>The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered, "I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.5'>The men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house at night. They intended to kill me, and they raped my concubine, and she is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.6'>I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed wickedness and disgrace in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.7'>Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give your advice and counsel here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.8'>All the people arose as one man, saying, "None of us will go to his tent, neither will any of us return to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.9'>But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.10'>and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to get food for the people, that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, they may do to it according to all the disgrace that they have committed in Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.11'>So all the men of Israel gathered against the city, united as one man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.12'>The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What wickedness is this that has happened among you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.13'>Now therefore deliver up the men, the wicked men who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel."But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.14'>The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.15'>The children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.16'>Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left-handed; everyone could sling stones at a hair and not miss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.17'>The men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men who drew sword: all these were men of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.18'>The children of Israel arose, and went up to Bethel, and asked counsel of God; and they said, "Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin?"The Lord said, "Judah first."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.19'>The children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.20'>The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.21'>The children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day Twenty-two thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.22'>The people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.23'>The children of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until evening; and they asked of the Lord, saying, "Shall I again draw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?"The Lord said, "Go up against him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.24'>The children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.25'>Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.26'>Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before the Lord, and fasted that day until evening; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.27'>The children of Israel asked of the Lord (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.28'>and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), "Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?"The Lord said, "Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.29'>Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.30'>The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.31'>The children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike and kill some of the people, as at other times, on the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.32'>The children of Benjamin said, "They are defeated before us, as previously." But the children of Israel said, "Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.33'>All the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal Tamar. And the men of Israel in ambush rushed out of their place, even out of Maareh Geba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.34'>There came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe; but they didn't know that disaster was close upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.35'>The Lord struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men: all armed with swords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.36'>So the children of Benjamin saw that they were defeated; for the men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin, because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.37'>The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; and the ambushers drew themselves along, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.38'>Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.39'>The men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, "Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.40'>But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold, the whole city went up in smoke into the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.41'>The men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were terrified; for they saw that disaster had come on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.42'>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.43'>They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, and overtook them opposite Gibeah toward the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.44'>There fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.45'>They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they killed on the highways five thousand men, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck down two thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.46'>So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand swordsmen; all these were valiant fighters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.47'>But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and stayed in the rock of Rimmon four months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.48'>The men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the livestock, and all that they found: moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.21.1'>Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, "There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.2'>The people came to Bethel, and sat there until evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept severely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.3'>They said, "Lord God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.4'>It happened on the next day that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.5'>The children of Israel said, "Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up in the assembly to the Lord?" For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who did not come up to the Lord to Mizpah, saying, "He shall surely be put to death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.6'>The children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, "There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.7'>How shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.8'>They said, "What one is there of the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the Lord to Mizpah?" Behold, no one came to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.9'>For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.10'>The congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, "Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.11'>This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has slept with a man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.12'>They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had never slept with a man; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.13'>The whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.14'>Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead: and yet so they weren't enough for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.15'>The people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a gap in the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.16'>Then the elders of the congregation said, "How shall we provide wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.17'>They said, "There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.18'>However we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, 'Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.19'>They said, "Behold, there is a feast of the Lord from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.20'>They commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, "Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.21'>and watch. If the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and each man catch his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.22'>It shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, 'Grant them graciously to us, because we didn't take wives for each man in battle, neither did you give them to them, otherwise you would now be guilty.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.23'>The children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off. They went and returned to their inheritance, built the cities, and lived in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.24'>The children of Israel departed there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.</verse>
