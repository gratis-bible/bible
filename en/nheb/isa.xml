      <chapter osisID='Isa.1'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Hear, heavens,and listen, earth; for the Lord has spoken:I have nourished and brought up children,and they have rebelled against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>The ox knows his owner,and the donkey his master's crib;but Israel doesn't know,my people do not consider.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>Ah sinful nation,a people loaded with iniquity,a seed of evildoers,children who deal corruptly!They have forsaken the Lord.They have despised the Holy One of Israel.They are estranged and backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>Why should you be beaten more,that you revolt more and more?The whole head is sick,and the whole heart faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it:wounds, welts, and open sores.They haven't been closed, neither bandaged, neither soothed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your country is desolate.Your cities are burned with fire.Strangers devour your land in your presence,and it is desolate,as overthrown by strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard,like a hut in a field of melons,like a besieged city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>Unless the Lord of hosts had left to us a very small remnant,we would have been as Sodom;we would have been like Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom!Listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>"What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?," says the Lord."I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams,and the fat of fed animals.I do not delight in the blood of bulls,or of lambs,or of male goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>When you come to appear before me,who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>Bring no more vain offerings.Incense is an abomination to me;new moons, Sabbaths, and convocations:I can't bear with evil assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts.They are a burden to me.I am weary of bearing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>When you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you.Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear.Your hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>Wash yourselves, make yourself clean.Put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes.Cease to do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>Learn to do well.Seek justice.Relieve the oppressed.Judge the fatherless.Plead for the widow."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>"Come now, and let us reason together," says the Lord:"Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'>If you are willing and obedient,you shall eat the good of the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'>but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword;for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'>How the faithful city has become a prostitute!She was full of justice; righteousness lodged in her,but now murderers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Your silver has become dross,your wine mixed with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves.Everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards.They do not judge the fatherless,neither does the cause of the widow come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>Therefore the Lord, the Lord of hosts,the Mighty One of Israel, says:"Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries,and avenge myself of my enemies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>and I will turn my hand on you,thoroughly purge away your dross,and will take away all your tin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>I will restore your judges as at the first,and your counselors as at the beginning.Afterward you shall be called 'The city of righteousness,a faithful town.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Zion shall be redeemed with justice,and her converts with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together,and those who forsake the Lord shall be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades,and as a garden that has no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>The strong will be like tinder,and his work like a spark.They will both burn together,and no one will quench them."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'>This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'>It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established on the top of the mountains,and shall be raised above the hills;and all nations shall flow to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'>Many peoples shall go and say,"Come, let's go up to the mountain of the Lord,to the house of the God of Jacob;and he will teach us of his ways,and we will walk in his paths."For out of Zion the law shall go forth,and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>He will judge between the nations,and will decide concerning many peoples;and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,and their spears into pruning hooks.Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,neither shall they learn war any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>House of Jacob, come, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,because they are filled from the east,with those who practice divination like the Philistines,and they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'>Their land is full of silver and gold,neither is there any end of their treasures.Their land also is full of horses,neither is there any end of their chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>Their land also is full of idols.They worship the work of their own hands,that which their own fingers have made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>Man is brought low,and mankind is humbled;therefore do not forgive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Enter into the rock,and hide in the dust,from before the terror of the Lord,and from the glory of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The lofty looks of man will be brought low,the haughtiness of men will be bowed down,and the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>For there will be a day of the Lord of hosts for all that is proud and haughty,and for all that is lifted up;and it shall be brought low:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>For all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,for all the oaks of Bashan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>For all the high mountains,for all the hills that are lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>For every lofty tower,for every fortified wall,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>For all the ships of Tarshish,and for all pleasant imagery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'>The loftiness of man shall be bowed down,and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low;and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'>The idols shall utterly pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'>Men shall go into the caves of the rocks,and into the holes of the earth,from before the terror of the Lord,and from the glory of his majesty,when he arises to shake the earth mightily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'>In that day, men shall cast away their idols of silver,and their idols of gold,which have been made for themselves to worship,to the moles and to the bats;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'>To go into the caverns of the rocks,and into the clefts of the ragged rocks,from before the terror of the Lord,and from the glory of his majesty,when he arises to shake the earth mightily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'>Stop trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils;for of what account is he?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'>For, behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah supply and support,the whole supply of bread,and the whole supply of water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'>the mighty man,the man of war,the judge,the prophet,the diviner,the elder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'>the captain of fifty,the honorable man,the counselor,the skilled craftsman,and the clever enchanter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'>I will give boys to be their princes,and children shall rule over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'>The people will be oppressed,everyone by another,and everyone by his neighbor.The child will behave himself proudly against the old man,and the base against the honorable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'>Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying,"You have clothing, you be our ruler,and let this ruin be under your hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'>In that day he will cry out, saying, I will not be a healer;for in my house is neither bread nor clothing.You shall not make me ruler of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen;because their tongue and their doings are against the Lord,to provoke the eyes of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'>The look of their faces testify against them.They parade their sin like Sodom.They do not hide it.Woe to their soul!For they have brought disaster upon themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'>Tell the righteous "Good!"For they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'>Woe to the wicked!Disaster is upon them;for the deeds of his hands will be paid back to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>As for my people, children are their oppressors,and women rule over them.My people, those who lead you cause you to err,and destroy the way of your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'>The Lord stands up to contend,and stands to judge the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'>The Lord will enter into judgment with the elders of his people,and their leaders:"It is you who have eaten up the vineyard.The spoil of the poor is in your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'>What do you mean that you crush my people,and grind the face of the poor?" says the Lord, the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'>Moreover the Lord said, "Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes,walking to trip as they go,jingling ornaments on their feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'>therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion,and the Lord will make their scalps bald."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'>In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, the headbands, the crescent necklaces,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'>the earrings, the bracelets, the veils,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'>the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume bottles, the charms,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'>the signet rings, the nose rings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.22'>the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'>the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras, and the shawls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'>It shall happen that instead of sweet spices, there shall be rottenness;instead of a belt, a rope;instead of well set hair, baldness;instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth;and branding instead of beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'>Your men shall fall by the sword,and your mighty in the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'>Her gates shall lament and mourn;and she shall be desolate and sit on the ground.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'>Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, "We will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothing: only let us be called by your name. Take away our reproach."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'>In that day, the Lord's branch will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and glory of the survivors of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'>It will happen, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.4'>when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from its midst, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.5'>The Lord will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory will be a canopy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.6'>There will be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'>Let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard.My beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'>He dug it up,gathered out its stones,planted it with the choicest vine,built a tower in its midst,and also cut out a winepress therein.He looked for it to yield grapes,but it yielded wild grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'>"Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,please judge between me and my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield wild grapes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'>Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard.I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up.I will break down its wall of it, and it will be trampled down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'>I will lay it a wasteland.It won't be pruned nor hoed,but it will grow briers and thorns.I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'>For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel,and the men of Judah his pleasant plant:and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression;for righteousness, but, behold, a cry of distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'>Woe to those who join house to house,who lay field to field, until there is no room,and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'>In my ears, the Lord of hosts says: "Surely many houses will be desolate,even great and beautiful, unoccupied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'>For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath,and a homer of seed shall yield an ephah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'>Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink;who stay late into the night, until wine inflames them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'>The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at their feasts;but they do not regard the work of the Lord,neither have they considered the operation of his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'>Therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge.Their honorable men are famished,and their multitudes are parched with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'>Therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire,and opened its mouth without measure;and their glory, their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices among them, descend into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'>So man is brought low,mankind is humbled,and the eyes of the arrogant ones are humbled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'>but the Lord of hosts is exalted in justice,and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'>Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture,and strangers will eat the ruins of the rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'>Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,and wickedness as with cart rope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'>Who say, "Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it;and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come,that we may know it!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.20'>Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;who put darkness for light,and light for darkness;who put bitter for sweet,and sweet for bitter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.21'>Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,and prudent in their own sight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.22'>Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine,and champions at mixing strong drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'>who acquit the guilty for a bribe,but deny justice for the innocent!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'>Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame,so their root shall be as rottenness,and their blossom shall go up as dust;because they have rejected the law of the Lord of hosts,and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'>Therefore the Lord's anger burns against his people,and he has stretched out his hand against them, and has struck them.The mountains tremble,and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets.For all this, his anger is not turned away,but his hand is still stretched out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'>He will lift up a banner to the nations from far,and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth.Behold, they will come speedily and swiftly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'>None shall be weary nor stumble among them;none shall slumber nor sleep;neither shall the belt of their waist be untied,nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'>whose arrows are sharp,and all their bows bent.Their horses' hoofs will be like flint,and their wheels like a whirlwind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'>Their roaring will be like a lioness.They will roar like young lions.Yes, they shall roar,and seize their prey and carry it off,and there will be no one to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'>They will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea.If one looks to the land behold, darkness and distress.The light is darkened in its clouds.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'>In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'>Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.3'>One called to another, and said,"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts!The whole earth is full of his glory!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.4'>The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.5'>Then I said, "Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.6'>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.7'>He touched my mouth with it, and said, "Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.8'>I heard the Lord's voice, saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?"Then I said, "Here I am. Send me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.9'>He said, "Go, and tell this people,'You hear indeed,but do not understand;and you see indeed,but do not perceive.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.10'>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.11'>Then I said, "Lord, how long?"He answered,"Until cities are waste without inhabitant,and houses without man,and the land becomes utterly waste,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.12'>And the Lord has removed men far away,and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.13'>If there is a tenth left in it,that also will in turn be consumed:as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they are felled;so the holy seed is its stock."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.7'>
