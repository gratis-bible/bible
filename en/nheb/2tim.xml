      <chapter osisID='2Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.3'>I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.4'>longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'>having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>For God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>For this, I was appointed as a proclaimer, an apostle, and a teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>For this cause I also suffer these things.Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'>That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'>This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'>May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'>but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'>(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.1'>You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.2'>The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'>You therefore must share in hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'>No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'>Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he is not crowned unless he has competed by the rules.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Good News,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God's word is not chained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'>Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones' sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'>This saying is faithful:"For if we died with him,we will also live with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'>If we endure,we will also reign with him.If we deny him,he also will deny us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>If we are faithless,he remains faithful,for he cannot deny himself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>Remind them of these things, charging them in the presence of God, that they do not argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'>Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who does not need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'>But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in ungodliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>However God's firm foundation stands, having this seal, "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master's use, prepared for every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'>But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'>For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'>without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'>traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'>holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof. Turn away from these, also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'>For of these are those who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'>always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'>But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'>But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'>persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'>Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'>But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'>But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'>From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'>Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'>that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his Kingdom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>proclaim the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to myths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'>For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'>I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>Be diligent to come to me soon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'>But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'>Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.14'>Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.15'>of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'>At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.18'>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.19'>Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.20'>Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.21'>Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.22'>The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.</verse>
