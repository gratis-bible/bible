      <chapter osisID='Exod.1'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.1'>Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.2'>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.3'>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.4'>Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.5'>All the souls who came out of Jacob's body were seventy-five souls, and Joseph was in Egypt already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.6'>Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.7'>The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.8'>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.9'>He said to his people, "Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.10'>Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and escape out of the land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.11'>Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.12'>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They were grieved because of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.13'>The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.14'>and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.15'>The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.16'>and he said, "When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool; if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.17'>But the midwives feared God, and did not do what the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the baby boys alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.18'>The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, "Why have you done this thing, and have saved the boys alive?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.19'>The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women aren't like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous, and give birth before the midwife comes to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.20'>God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.21'>It happened, because the midwives feared God, that he gave them families.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.22'>Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, "You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.2'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.1'>A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.2'>The woman conceived, and bore a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.3'>When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river's bank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.4'>His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.5'>Pharaoh's daughter came down to bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket among the reeds, and sent her handmaid to get it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.6'>She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. And she had compassion on him, and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.7'>Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.8'>Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go."The maiden went and called the child's mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.9'>Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages."The woman took the child, and nursed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.10'>The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, and said, "Because I drew him out of the water."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.11'>It happened in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brothers, and looked at their burdens. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.12'>He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.13'>He went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other. He said to him who did the wrong, "Why do you strike your fellow?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.14'>He said, "Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?" Moses was afraid, and said, "Surely this thing is known."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.15'>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.16'>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.17'>The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.18'>When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, "How is it that you have returned so early today?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.19'>They said, "An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.20'>He said to his daughters, "Where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.21'>Moses was content to dwell with the man. He gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.22'>She bore a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, "I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.23'>It happened in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.24'>God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.25'>God saw the children of Israel, and God was concerned about them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.3'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.1'>Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to God's mountain, to Horeb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.2'>The angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.3'>Moses said, "I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.4'>When the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said, "Moses! Moses!"He said, "Here I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.5'>He said, "Do not come close. Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place you are standing on is holy ground."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.6'>Moreover he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.7'>The Lord said, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.8'>I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.9'>Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.10'>Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.11'>Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.12'>He said, "Certainly I will be with you. This will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.13'>Moses said to God, "Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you;' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' What should I tell them?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.14'>God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM," and he said, "You shall tell the children of Israel this: 'I AM has sent me to you.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.15'>God said moreover to Moses, "You shall tell the children of Israel this, 'The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.16'>Go, and gather the elders of the children of Israel together, and tell them, 'The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, "I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.17'>and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.18'>They will listen to your voice, and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall tell him, 'The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord, our God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.19'>I know that the king of Egypt won't give you permission to go, except by a mighty hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.20'>I will put forth my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst, and after that he will let you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.21'>I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and it will happen that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.22'>But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who visits her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters. You shall despoil the Egyptians.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.4'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.1'>Moses answered, "But, behold, they will not believe me, nor listen to my voice; for they will say, 'The Lord has not appeared to you.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.2'>The Lord said to him, "What is that in your hand?"He said, "A rod."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.3'>He said, "Throw it on the ground."He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses ran away from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.4'>The Lord said to Moses, "Put forth your hand, and take it by the tail."He put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.5'>"That they may believe that the Lord, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.6'>The Lord said furthermore to him, "Now put your hand inside your cloak."He put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out from his cloak, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.7'>He said, "Put your hand inside your cloak again."He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when he took it out of his cloak, behold, it had turned again as his other flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.8'>"It will happen, if they will neither believe you nor listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.9'>It will happen, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither listen to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.10'>Moses said to the Lord, "Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before now, nor since you have spoken to your servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.11'>The Lord said to him, "Who made man's mouth? Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Isn't it I, the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.12'>Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.13'>He said, "Oh, Lord, please send someone else."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.14'>The anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said, "What about Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Also, behold, he comes forth to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.15'>You shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.16'>He will be your spokesman to the people; and it will happen, that he will be to you a mouth, and you will be to him as God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.17'>You shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.18'>Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, "Please let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive."Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.19'>The Lord said to Moses in Midian, "Go, return into Egypt; for all the men who sought your life are dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.20'>Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. Moses took God's rod in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.21'>The Lord said to Moses, "When you go back into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.22'>You shall tell Pharaoh, 'Thus says the Lord, Israel is my son, my firstborn,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.23'>and I have said to you, "Let my son go, that he may serve me;" and you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.24'>It happened on the way at a lodging place, that the Lord met him and wanted to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.25'>Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.26'>So he let him alone. Then she said, "You are a bridegroom of blood," because of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.27'>The Lord said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses."He went, and met him on God's mountain, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.28'>Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had instructed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.29'>Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.30'>Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.31'>The people believed, and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.5'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.1'>Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says, 'Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.2'>Pharaoh said, "Who is the Lord, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I do not know the Lord, and moreover I will not let Israel go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.3'>They said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the Lord, our God, lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.4'>The king of Egypt said to them, "Why do you, Moses and Aaron, separate the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.5'>Pharaoh said, "Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.6'>The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.7'>"You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.8'>The number of the bricks, which they made before, you require from them. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.9'>Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may regard it; and do not let them regard lying words."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.10'>The taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, This is what Pharaoh says: "I will not give you straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.11'>Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.12'>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.13'>The taskmasters were urgent saying, "Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw given to you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.14'>The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, "Why haven't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.15'>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you deal this way with your servants?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.16'>No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, 'Make brick!' and behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.17'>But he said, "You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.18'>Go therefore now, and work, for no straw shall be given to you, yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.19'>The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble, when it was said, "You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.20'>They met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.21'>and they said to them, "May the Lord look at you, and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.22'>Moses returned to the Lord, and said, "Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why is it that you have sent me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.23'>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people; neither have you delivered your people at all."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.6.1'>The Lord said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh, for by a strong hand he shall let them go, and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.6.4'>I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they lived as foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.5'>Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.6'>Therefore tell the children of Israel, 'I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Exod.7'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.1'>The Lord said to Moses, "Behold, I have made you as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.2'>You shall speak all that I command you; and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.3'>I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.4'>But Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I will lay my hand on Egypt, and bring forth my armies, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.5'>The Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I stretch forth my hand on Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.6'>Moses and Aaron did so. As the Lord commanded them, so they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.7'>Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.8'>The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.9'>"When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 'Perform a miracle!' then you shall tell Aaron, 'Take your rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.10'>Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, as the Lord had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.11'>Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers. They also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.12'>For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.13'>Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them; as the Lord had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.14'>The Lord said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is stubborn. He refuses to let the people go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.15'>Go to Pharaoh in the morning. Behold, he goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the river's bank to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.16'>You shall tell him, 'The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, "Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness:" and behold, until now you haven't listened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.17'>Thus says the Lord, "In this you shall know that I am the Lord. Behold, I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.18'>The fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river."'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.19'>The Lord said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Take your rod, and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.20'>Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and struck the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.21'>The fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians couldn't drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.22'>The magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them; as the Lord had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.23'>Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.24'>All the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink; for they couldn't drink of the water of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.25'>Seven days were fulfilled, after the Lord had struck the river.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Exod.8'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.1'>The Lord spoke to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, "This is what the Lord says, 'Let my people go, that they may serve me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.2'>If you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your borders with frogs:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.3'>and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedchamber, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.4'>and the frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people, and on all your servants.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.5'>The Lord said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch forth your hand with your rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.6'>Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.7'>The magicians did in like manner with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.8'>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, "Entreat the Lord, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.9'>Moses said to Pharaoh, "I give you the honor of setting the time that I should pray for you, and for your servants, and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, and remain in the river only."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.10'>He said, "Tomorrow."He said, "Be it according to your word, that you may know that there is none like the Lord our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.11'>The frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.12'>Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the Lord concerning the frogs which he had brought on Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.13'>The Lord did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.14'>They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.15'>But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and did not listen to them, as the Lord had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.16'>The Lord said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.17'>They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were lice on man, and on animal; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.18'>The magicians tried with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they couldn't. There were lice on man, and on animal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.19'>Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God:" and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them; as the Lord had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.20'>The Lord said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; behold, he comes forth to the water; and tell him, 'This is what the Lord says, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.21'>Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.22'>I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.23'>I will put a division between my people and your people: by tomorrow shall this sign be."'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.24'>The Lord did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.25'>Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God in the land!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.26'>Moses said, "It isn't appropriate to do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God. Behold, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and won't they stone us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.27'>We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the Lord our God, as he shall command us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.28'>Pharaoh said, "I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness, only you shall not go very far away. Pray for me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.29'>Moses said, "Behold, I go out from you, and I will pray to the Lord that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only do not let Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.30'>Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.31'>The Lord did according to the word of Moses, and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. There remained not one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.32'>Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.9.1'>Then the Lord said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, 'This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, that they may serve me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.9.3'>behold, the hand of the Lord is on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.4'>The Lord will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongs to the children of Israel."'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.5'>The Lord appointed a set time, saying, "Tomorrow the Lord shall do this thing in the land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.6'>The Lord did that thing on the next day; and all the livestock of the Egyptians died, but of the livestock of the children of Israel, not one died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.7'>Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the livestock of Israel dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.8'>The Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, "Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.9'>It shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with boils on man and on animal, throughout all the land of Egypt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.10'>They took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky; and it became a boil breaking forth with boils on man and on animal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.11'>The magicians couldn't stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.12'>The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, as the Lord had spoken to Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.13'>The Lord said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, 'This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, that they may serve me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.14'>For this time I will send all my plagues against your heart, against your officials, and against your people; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.15'>For now I would have put forth my hand, and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.16'>but indeed for this cause I have made you stand: to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.17'>as you still exalt yourself against my people, that you won't let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.18'>Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.19'>Now therefore command that all of your livestock and all that you have in the field be brought into shelter. Every man and animal that is found in the field, and isn't brought home, the hail shall come down on them, and they shall die."'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.20'>Those who feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.21'>Whoever did not regard the word of the Lord left his servants and his livestock in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.22'>The Lord said to Moses, "Stretch forth your hand toward the sky, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man, and on animal, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.23'>Moses stretched forth his rod toward the heavens, and the Lord sent thunder, hail, and lightning flashed down to the earth. The Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.24'>So there was very severe hail, and lightning mixed with the hail, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.25'>The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and animal; and the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.26'>Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.27'>Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, "I have sinned this time. The Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.28'>Pray to the Lord; for there has been enough of mighty thunderings and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.29'>Moses said to him, "As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the Lord. The thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that you may know that the earth is the Lord's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.30'>But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the Lord God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.31'>The flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.32'>But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they had not grown up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.33'>Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the Lord; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.34'>When Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.35'>The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go, just as the Lord had spoken through Moses.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Exod.10'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.1'>The Lord said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.10.5'>and they shall cover the surface of the earth, so that one won't be able to see the earth. They shall eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.6'>Your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither your fathers nor your fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.'" He turned, and went out from Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.7'>Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the Lord, their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt is destroyed?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.8'>Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, "Go, serve the Lord your God; but who are those who will go?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.9'>Moses said, "We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.10'>He said to them, "The Lord be with you if I will let you go with your little ones! See, evil is clearly before your faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.11'>Not so! Go now you who are men, and serve the Lord; for that is what you desire!" They were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.12'>The Lord said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.13'>Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.14'>The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt. They were very grievous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.</verse>
