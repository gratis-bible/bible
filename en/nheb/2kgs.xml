      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.1'>Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.2'>Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in Samaria, and was sick. So he sent messengers, and said to them, "Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.3'>But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.4'>Now therefore thus says the Lord, "You shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die."'" Elijah departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.5'>The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, "Why is it that you have returned?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.6'>They said to him, "A man came up to meet us, and said to us, 'Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him, "Thus says the Lord, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.'"'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.7'>He said to them, "What kind of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.8'>They answered him, "He was a hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his waist."He said, "It is Elijah the Tishbite."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.9'>Then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him. He went up to him; and behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to him, "Man of God, the king has said, 'Come down!'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.10'>Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!" Fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.11'>Again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty. He answered him, "Man of God, the king has said, 'Come down quickly!'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.12'>Elijah answered them, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!" The fire of God came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.13'>Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, "Man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.14'>Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.15'>The angel of the Lord said to Elijah, "Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him."He arose, and went down with him to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.16'>He said to him, "Thus says the Lord, 'Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.17'>So he died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.18'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.1'>It happened, when the Lord would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.2'>Elijah said to Elisha, "Please wait here, for the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel."Elisha said, "As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.3'>The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, "Do you know that the Lord will take away your master from your head today?"He said, "Yes, I know it; hold your peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.4'>Elijah said to him, "Elisha, please wait here, for the Lord has sent me to Jericho."He said, "As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you." So they came to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.5'>The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, "Do you know that the Lord will take away your master from your head today?"He answered, "Yes, I know it. Hold your peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.6'>Elijah said to him, "Please wait here, for the Lord has sent me to the Jordan."He said, "As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you." They both went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.7'>Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.8'>Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they two went over on dry ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.9'>It happened, when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, "Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you."Elisha said, "Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.10'>He said, "You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.11'>It happened, as they still went on, and talked, that behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.12'>Elisha saw it, and he cried, "My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!"He saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.13'>He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.14'>He took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, "Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah?" When he also had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and Elisha went over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.15'>When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, "The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha." They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.16'>They said to him, "See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up, and put him on some mountain, or into some valley.He said, "You shall not send them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.17'>When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, "Send them."They sent therefore fifty men; and they searched for three days, but did not find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.18'>They came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, "Did I not tell you, 'Do not go?'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.19'>The men of the city said to Elisha, "Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land miscarries."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.20'>He said, "Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it." They brought it to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.21'>He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, "Thus says the Lord, 'I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or miscarrying.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.22'>So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.23'>He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, "Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldhead!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.24'>He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. Two female bears came out of the woods, and mauled forty-two of those youths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.25'>He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.1'>Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.2'>He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.3'>Nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.4'>Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lambs, and of one hundred thousand rams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.5'>But it happened, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.6'>King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.7'>He went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab to battle?"He said, "I will go up. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.8'>He said, "Which way shall we go up?"He answered, "The way of the wilderness of Edom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.9'>So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days' journey. There was no water for the army, nor for the animals that followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.10'>The king of Israel said, "Alas! For the Lord has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.11'>But Jehoshaphat said, "Isn't there here a prophet of the Lord, that we may inquire of the Lord by him?"One of the king of Israel's servants answered, "Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.12'>Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the Lord is with him." So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.13'>Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother."The king of Israel said to him, "No; for the Lord has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.14'>Elisha said, "As the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I respect the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.15'>But now bring me a minstrel." It happened, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the Lord came on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.16'>He said, "Thus says the Lord, 'Make this valley full of trenches.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.17'>For thus says the Lord, 'You will not see wind, neither will you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and you will drink, both you and your livestock and your animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.18'>This is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord. He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.19'>You shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.20'>It happened in the morning, about the time of offering the offering, that behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.21'>Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.22'>They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.23'>They said, "This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each other. Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.24'>When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.25'>They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the springs of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth only they left its stones; however the men armed with slings went about it, and struck it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.26'>When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.27'>Then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.1'>Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, "Your servant my husband is dead. You know that your servant feared the Lord. Now the creditor has come to take for himself my two children to be slaves."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.2'>Elisha said to her, "What shall I do for you? Tell me: what do you have in the house?"She said, "Your handmaid has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.3'>Then he said, "Go, borrow containers from of all your neighbors, even empty containers. Do not borrow just a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.4'>You shall go in, and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour out into all those containers; and you shall set aside that which is full."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.5'>So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons; they brought the containers to her, and she poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.6'>It happened, when the containers were full, that she said to her son, "Bring me another container."He said to her, "There isn't another container." The oil stopped flowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.7'>Then she came and told the man of God. He said, "Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.8'>It fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she persuaded him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.9'>She said to her husband, "See now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passes by us continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.10'>Please let us make a little room on the wall. Let us set for him there a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp stand. It shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.11'>One day he came there, and he turned into the room and lay there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.12'>He said to Gehazi his servant, "Call this Shunammite." When he had called her, she stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.13'>He said to him, "Say now to her, 'Behold, you have cared for us with all this care. What is to be done for you? Would you like to be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army?'"She answered, "I dwell among my own people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.14'>He said, "What then is to be done for her?"Gehazi answered, "Most certainly she has no son, and her husband is old."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.15'>He said, "Call her." When he had called her, she stood in the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.16'>He said, "At this season, when the time comes around, you will embrace a son."She said, "No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your handmaid."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.17'>The woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came around, as Elisha had said to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.18'>When the child was grown, it happened one day that he went out to his father to the reapers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.19'>He said to his father, "My head! My head!"He said to his servant, "Carry him to his mother."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.20'>When he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.21'>She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door on him, and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.22'>She called to her husband, and said, "Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.23'>He said, "Why would you want go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath."She said, "It's alright."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.24'>Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, "Drive, and go forward! Do not slow down for me, unless I ask you to."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.25'>So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. It happened, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, "Behold, there is the Shunammite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.26'>Please run now to meet her, and ask her, 'Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?'"She answered, "It is well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.27'>When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, "Leave her alone; for her soul is troubled within her; and the Lord has hidden it from me, and has not told me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.28'>Then she said, "Did I desire a son of my lord? Did I not say, Do not deceive me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.29'>Then he said to Gehazi, "Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet any man, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not answer him again. Then lay my staff on the face of the child."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.30'>The mother of the child said, "As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you."He arose, and followed her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.31'>Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, "The child has not awakened."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.32'>When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and lay on his bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.33'>He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.34'>He went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child grew warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.35'>Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.36'>He called Gehazi, and said, "Call this Shunammite!" So he called her.When she had come in to him, he said, "Take up your son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.37'>Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.38'>Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, "Set on the great pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.39'>One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of stew; for they did not recognize them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.40'>So they poured out for the men to eat. It happened, as they were eating of the stew, that they cried out, and said, "Man of God, there is death in the pot!" They could not eat of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.41'>But he said, "Then bring meal." He cast it into the pot; and he said, "Pour out for the people, that they may eat." There was no harm in the pot.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.1'>Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him the Lord had given victory to Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.2'>The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.3'>She said to her mistress, "I wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.4'>Someone went in, and told his lord, saying, "The maiden who is from the land of Israel said this."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.5'>The king of Syria said, "Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel."He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.6'>He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, "Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.7'>It happened, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said, "Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.8'>It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, "Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.9'>So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.10'>Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.11'>But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, "Behold, I thought, 'He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.12'>Aren't Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn't I wash in them, and be clean?" So he turned and went away in a rage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.13'>His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, "My father, if the prophet had asked you do some great thing, wouldn't you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, 'Wash, and be clean?'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.14'>Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.15'>He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, "See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, please take a gift from your servant."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.16'>But he said, "As the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none."He urged him to take it; but he refused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.17'>Naaman said, "If not, then, please let two mules' burden of earth be given to your servant; for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.18'>In this thing may the Lord pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon. When I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may the Lord pardon your servant in this thing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.19'>He said to him, "Go in peace."So he departed from him a little way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.20'>But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, "Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As the Lord lives, I will run after him, and take something from him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.21'>So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him, and said, "Is all well?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.22'>He said, "All is well. My master has sent me, saying, 'Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.23'>Naaman said, "Be pleased to take two talents." He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they carried them before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.24'>When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go, and they departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.25'>But he went in, and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, "Where did you come from, Gehazi?"He said, "Your servant went nowhere."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.26'>He said to him, "Did not my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and cattle, and male servants and female servants?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.27'>Therefore the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your seed forever."He went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.1'>The sons of the prophets said to Elisha, "See now, the place where we dwell before you is too small for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.2'>Please let us go to the Jordan, and every man take a beam from there, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell."He answered, "Go!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.3'>One said, "Please be pleased to go with your servants."He answered, "I will go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.4'>So he went with them. When they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.5'>But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water. Then he cried, and said, "Alas, my master! For it was borrowed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.6'>The man of God asked, "Where did it fall?" He showed him the place. He cut down a stick, threw it in there, and made the iron float.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.7'>He said, "Take it." So he put out his hand and took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.8'>Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, "My camp will be in such and such a place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.9'>The man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, "Beware that you not pass such a place; for the Syrians are coming down there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.10'>The king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once nor twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.11'>The heart of the king of Syria was very troubled about this. He called his servants, and said to them, "Won't you show me which of us is for the king of Israel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.12'>One of his servants said, "No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.13'>He said, "Go and see where he is, that I may send and get him."It was told him, saying, "Behold, he is in Dothan."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.14'>Therefore he sent horses, chariots, and a great army there. They came by night, and surrounded the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.15'>When the servant of the man of God had risen early, and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was around the city. His servant said to him, "Alas, my master! What shall we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.16'>He answered, "Do not be afraid; for those who are with us are more than those who are with them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.17'>Elisha prayed, and said, "Lord, please open his eyes, that he may see." The Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.18'>When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the Lord, and said, "Please strike this people with blindness."He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.19'>Elisha said to them, "This is not the way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek." He led them to Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.20'>It happened, when they had come into Samaria, that Elisha said, "Lord, open the eyes of these men, that they may see."The Lord opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.21'>The king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, "My father, shall I strike them? Shall I strike them?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.22'>He answered, "You shall not strike them. Would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.23'>He prepared great feast for them. When they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. The bands of Syria stopped raiding the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.24'>It happened after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.25'>There was a great famine in Samaria. Behold, they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.26'>As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, saying, "Help, my lord, O king!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.27'>He said, "If the Lord doesn't help you, from where could I help you? From of the threshing floor, or from the winepress?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.28'>The king said to her, "What ails you?"She answered, "This woman said to me, 'Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.29'>So we boiled my son, and ate him: and I said to her on the next day, 'Give your son, that we may eat him;' and she has hidden her son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.30'>It happened, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes (now he was passing by on the wall); and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth underneath on his flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.31'>Then he said, "God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stay on him this day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.32'>But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Then the king sent a man from before him; but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, "Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Behold, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door shut against him. Isn't the sound of his master's feet behind him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.33'>While he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him. Then he said, "Behold, this disaster is from the Lord. Why should I wait for the Lord any longer?"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.1'>Elisha said, "Hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord, 'Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour will be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.2'>Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, "Behold, if the Lord made windows in heaven, could this thing be?"He said, "Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.3'>Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate. They said one to another, "Why do we sit here until we die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.4'>If we say, 'We will enter into the city,' then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. If we sit still here, we also die. Now therefore come, and let us surrender to the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we will live; and if they kill us, we will only die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.5'>They rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians. When they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.6'>For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great army: and they said one to another, Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.7'>Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.8'>When these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drink, and carried there silver, and gold, and clothing, and went and hid it. Then they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried there also, and went and hid it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.9'>Then they said one to another, "We aren't doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we keep silent. If we wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.10'>So they came and called to the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, "We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.11'>He called the porters; and they told it to the king's household within.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.12'>The king arose in the night, and said to his servants, "I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, 'When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.13'>One of his servants answered, "Please let some take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are consumed. Let us send and see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.14'>They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the army of the Syrians, saying, "Go and see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.15'>They went after them to the Jordan; and behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned, and told the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.16'>The people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.17'>The king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate: and the people trod on him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.18'>It happened, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, "Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria";</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.33'>And they feared the Lord, yet served their own gods, after the ways of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.</verse>
