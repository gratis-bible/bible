      <chapter osisID='Jer.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.1'>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.2'>to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.3'>It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.4'>Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.5'>"Before I formed you in the belly, I knew you. Before you came forth out of the womb, I sanctified you. I have appointed you a prophet to the nations."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.6'>Then I said, "Ah, Lord God! Behold, I do not know how to speak; for I am a child."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.7'>But the Lord said to me, "Do not say, 'I am a child;' for to whoever I shall send you, you shall go, and whatever I shall command you, you shall speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.8'>Do not be afraid because of them; for I am with you to deliver you," says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.9'>Then the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth; and the Lord said to me, "Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.10'>Behold, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.11'>Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, "Jeremiah, what do you see?"I said, "I see a branch of an almond tree."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.12'>Then the Lord said to me, "You have seen well; for I watch over my word to perform it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.13'>The word of the Lord came to me the second time, saying, "What do you see?"I said, "I see a boiling caldron; and it is tipping away from the north."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.14'>Then the Lord said to me, "Out of the north evil will break out on all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.15'>For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north," says the Lord; "and they shall come, and they shall each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.16'>I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.17'>"You therefore put your belt on your waist, arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.18'>For, behold, I have made you this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.19'>They will fight against you; but they will not prevail against you; for I am with you," says the Lord, "to deliver you."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.1'>The word of the Lord came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.2'>"Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, 'Thus says the Lord, "I remember you, the devotion of your youth, the love of your weddings; how you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.3'>Israel was holiness to the Lord, the first fruits of his increase. All who devour him shall be held guilty. Evil shall come on them,"' says the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.4'>Hear the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.5'>Thus says the Lord, "What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me, that they have gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.6'>Neither did they say, 'Where is the Lord who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none passed through, and where no man lived?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.7'>I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat its fruit and its goodness; but when you entered, you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.8'>The priests did not say, 'Where is the Lord?' And those who handle the law did not know me. The rulers also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.9'>"Therefore I will yet contend with you," says the Lord, "and I will contend with your children's children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.10'>For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there has been such a thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.11'>Has a nation changed its gods, which really are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.12'>"Be astonished, you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid. Be very desolate," says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.13'>"For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the spring of living waters, and cut them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.14'>Is Israel a servant? Is he a native-born slave? Why has he become a prey?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.15'>The young lions have roared at him, and yelled. They have made his land waste. His cities are burned up, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.16'>The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.17'>"Haven't you brought this on yourself, in that you have forsaken the Lord your God, when he led you by the way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.18'>Now what have you to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? Or what have you to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.19'>"Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backsliding shall reprove you. Know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that you have forsaken the Lord your God, and that my fear is not in you," says the Lord, God of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.20'>"For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bonds; and you said, 'I will not serve;' for on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed yourself, playing the prostitute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.21'>Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed. How then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.22'>For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me," says the Lord God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.23'>"How can you say, 'I am not defiled. I have not gone after the Baals'? See your way in the valley. Know what you have done. You are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.24'>a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind in her desire. When she is in heat, who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her month, they will find her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.25'>"Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst. But you said, 'It is in vain. No, for I have loved strangers, and I will go after them.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.26'>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.27'>who tell wood, 'You are my father;' and a stone, 'You have brought me out:' for they have turned their back to me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, 'Arise, and save us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.28'>"But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.29'>"Why will you contend with me? You all have transgressed against me," says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.30'>"I have struck your children in vain. They received no correction. Your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.31'>Generation, consider the word of the Lord. Have I been a wilderness to Israel? Or a land of thick darkness? Why do my people say, 'We have broken loose. We will come to you no more?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.32'>"Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.33'>How well you prepare your way to seek love! Therefore you have taught even the wicked women your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.34'>Also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts. You did not find them breaking in; but it is because of all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.35'>"Yet you said, 'I am innocent. Surely his anger has turned away from me.'"Behold, I will judge you, because you say, 'I have not sinned.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.36'>Why do you go about so much to change your way? You will be ashamed of Egypt also, as you were ashamed of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.37'>From there also you shall go forth, with your hands on your head; for the Lord has rejected those in whom you trust, and you shall not prosper with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.1'>"They say, 'If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him, and become another man's, will he return to her again?' Wouldn't that land be greatly polluted? But you have played the prostitute with many lovers; yet return again to me," says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.2'>"Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been lain with? You have sat for them by the ways, as an Arabian in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.3'>Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; yet you have a prostitute's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.4'>Will you not from this time cry to me, 'My Father, you are the guide of my youth?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.5'>"'Will he retain his anger forever? Will he keep it to the end?' Behold, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have had your way."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.6'>Moreover, the Lord said to me in the days of Josiah the king, "Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the prostitute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.7'>I said after she had done all these things, 'She will return to me;' but she did not return; and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.8'>I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce, yet treacherous Judah, her sister, did not fear; but she also went and played the prostitute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.9'>It happened through the lightness of her prostitution, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.10'>Yet for all this her treacherous sister, Judah, has not returned to me with her whole heart, but only in pretense," says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.11'>The Lord said to me, "Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.12'>Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, 'Return, you backsliding Israel,' says the Lord; 'I will not look in anger on you; for I am merciful,' says the Lord. 'I will not keep anger forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.13'>Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against the Lord your God, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed my voice,'" says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.14'>"Return, backsliding children," says the Lord; "for I am a husband to you. I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.15'>I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.16'>It shall come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days," says the Lord, "they shall say no more, 'The ark of the covenant of the Lord!' neither shall it come to mind; neither shall they remember it; neither shall they miss it; neither shall it be made any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.17'>At that time they shall call Jerusalem 'The throne of the Lord;' and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of the Lord, to Jerusalem. Neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.18'>In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.19'>"But I said, 'How I would put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the armies of the nations!' and I said, 'You shall call me "My Father," and shall not turn away from following me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.20'>"Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so you have dealt treacherously with me, house of Israel," says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.21'>A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.22'>"Return, you backsliding children, I will heal your backsliding.""Behold, we have come to you; for you are the Lord our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.23'>Truly in vain is help from the hills, the tumult on the mountains. Truly the salvation of Israel is in the Lord our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.24'>But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.25'>Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against the Lord our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day. We have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.1'>"If you will return, Israel," says the Lord, "if you will return to me, and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight; then you shall not be removed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.2'>and you shall swear, 'As the Lord lives,' in truth, in justice, and in righteousness. The nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.3'>For thus says the Lord to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, "Break up your fallow ground, and do not sow among thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.4'>Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.5'>Declare in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, 'Blow the trumpet in the land!' Cry aloud and say, 'Assemble yourselves! Let us go into the fortified cities!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.6'>Set up a standard toward Zion. Flee for safety! Do not wait; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.7'>A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations; he is on his way, he is gone forth from his place, to make your land desolate, that your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.8'>For this clothe yourself with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of the Lord hasn't turned back from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.9'>"It shall happen at that day," says the Lord, "that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.10'>Then I said, "Ah, Lord God! Surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, 'You shall have peace;' whereas the sword reaches to the heart."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.11'>At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, "A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.12'>a full wind from these shall come for me. Now I will also utter judgments against them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.13'>Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as the whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.14'>Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long shall your evil thoughts lodge within you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.15'>For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.16'>"Tell the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, 'Watchers come from a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.17'>As keepers of a field, they are against her all around, because she has been rebellious against me,'" says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.18'>"Your way and your doings have brought these things to you. This is your wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reaches to your heart."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.19'>My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I can't hold my peace; because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.20'>Destruction on destruction is proclaimed; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly are my tents destroyed, and my curtains in a moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.21'>How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.22'>"For my people are foolish, they do not know me. They are foolish children, and they have no understanding. They are skillful in doing evil, but to do good they have no knowledge."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.23'>I saw the earth, and, behold, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.24'>I saw the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills moved back and forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.25'>I saw, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the sky had fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.26'>I saw, and behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of the Lord, before his fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.27'>For thus says the Lord, "The whole land shall be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.28'>For this the earth will mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not relented, neither will I turn back from it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.29'>Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers; they go into the thickets, and climb up on the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.30'>You, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you dress yourselves with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with paint, in vain do you make yourself beautiful; your lovers despise you, they seek your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.31'>For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, saying, "Woe is me now! For my soul faints before the murderers."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.1'>"Run back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places of it, if you can find a man, if there are any who does justly, who seeks truth; and I will pardon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.2'>Though they say, 'As the Lord lives;' surely they swear falsely."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.3'>O Lord, do your eyes not look on truth? You have stricken them, but they were not grieved. You have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction. They have made their faces harder than a rock. They have refused to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.4'>Then I said, "Surely these are poor. They are foolish; for they do not know the way of the Lord, nor the law of their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.5'>I will go to the great men, and will speak to them; for they know the way of the Lord, and the law of their God." But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.6'>Therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them, a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them, a leopard shall watch against their cities; everyone who goes out there shall be torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many, and their backsliding is increased.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.10.1'>Hear the word which the Lord speaks to you, house of Israel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.2'>Thus says the Lord, "Do not learn the way of the nations, and do not be dismayed at the signs of the sky; for the nations are dismayed at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.3'>For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.4'>They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it not move.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.5'>They are like a palm tree, of turned work, and do not speak: they must be carried, because they can't go. Do not be afraid of them; for they can't do evil, neither is it in them to do good."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.6'>"There is none like you, Lord; you are great, and your name is great in might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.7'>Who should not fear you, King of the nations? For it appertains to you; because among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.8'>But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.9'>There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skillful men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.10'>But the Lord is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembles, and the nations are not able to withstand his indignation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.11'>You shall say this to them: 'The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.12'>He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.13'>when he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings for the rain, and brings forth the wind out of his treasuries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.14'>Every man has become brutish and without knowledge; every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.15'>They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.16'>The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; the Lord of hosts is his name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.17'>'Gather up your wares out of the land, you who live under siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.18'>For thus says the Lord, 'Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel it.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.19'>Woe is me because of my hurt! My wound is grievous: but I said, 'Truly this is my grief, and I must bear it.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.20'>My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are no more: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.21'>For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of the Lord: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.22'>The voice of news, behold, it comes, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling place of jackals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.23'>Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man who walks to direct his steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.24'>Lord, correct me, but in measure: not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.25'>Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know you, and on the families that do not call on your name: for they have devoured Jacob, yes, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.11'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.1'>The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.2'>"Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.3'>and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: "Cursed is the man who doesn't hear the words of this covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.4'>which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, "Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so you shall be my people, and I will be your God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.5'>that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey," as at this day.'" Then I answered, and said, "Amen, Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.6'>The Lord said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, 'Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.7'>For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.8'>Yet they did not obey, nor turn their ear, but walked everyone in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not do them.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.9'>The Lord said to me, "A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.10'>They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they are gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.11'>Therefore thus says the Lord, 'Behold, I will bring disaster on them, which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall cry to me, but I will not listen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.12'>Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense: but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.13'>For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.14'>Therefore do not pray for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.15'>"What has my beloved to do in my house, since she has worked lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from you? When you do evil, then you rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.16'>The Lord called your name, "A green olive tree, beautiful with goodly fruit." With the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it, and its branches are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.17'>For the Lord of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have worked for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.18'>The Lord gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it: then you showed me their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.19'>But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I did not know that they had devised devices against me, saying, "Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.20'>"But, the Lord of hosts, who judges righteously, who tests the heart and the mind, I shall see your vengeance on them; for to you have I revealed my cause."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.21'>Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, "You shall not prophesy in the name of the Lord, that you not die by our hand;"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.22'>therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, "Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.23'>and there shall be no remnant to them: for I will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.12'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.1'>You are righteous, Lord, when I contend with you; yet I would reason the cause with you: why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why are they all at ease who deal very treacherously?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.2'>You have planted them, yes, they have taken root; they grow, yes, they bring forth fruit: you are near in their mouth, and far from their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.3'>But you, Lord, know me; you see me, and try my heart toward you: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.4'>How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? For the wickedness of those who dwell therein, the animals are consumed, and the birds; because they said, "He shall not see our latter end."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.5'>"If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with horses? And though in a land of peace you are secure, yet how will you do in the pride of the Jordan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.6'>For even your brothers, and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; even they have cried aloud after you: do not believe them, though they speak beautiful words to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.7'>I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.8'>My heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest: she has uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.9'>Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey? Are the birds of prey against her all around? Go, assemble all the animals of the field, bring them to devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.10'>Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.11'>They have made it a desolation; it mourns to me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man lays it to heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.12'>Destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of the Lord devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh has peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.13'>They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and you shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.14'>Thus says the Lord against all my evil neighbors, who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: 'behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.15'>It shall happen, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.16'>It shall happen, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, "As the Lord lives;" even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.17'>But if they will not hear, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it,'" says the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.13'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.1'>Thus says the Lord to me, "Go, and buy yourself a linen belt, and put it on your waist, and do not put it in water."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.2'>So I bought a belt according to the word of the Lord, and put it on my waist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.3'>The word of the Lord came to me the second time, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.4'>"Take the belt that you have bought, which is on your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.5'>So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.6'>It happened after many days, that the Lord said to me, "Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the belt from there, which I commanded you to hide there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.7'>Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it; and behold, the belt was marred, it was profitable for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.8'>Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.9'>"Thus says the Lord, 'In this way I will mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.10'>This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this belt, which is profitable for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.11'>For as the belt clings to the waist of a man, so have I caused to cling to me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah,' says the Lord; 'that they might be my people, for a name, for praise, and for glory. But they would not listen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.12'>Therefore you shall speak to them this word: 'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, "Every bottle shall be filled with wine:"' and they shall tell you, 'Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.13'>Then you shall tell them, 'Thus says the Lord, "Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who sit on David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.14'>I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, says the Lord. I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them."'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.15'>"Hear, and give ear; do not be proud; for the Lord has spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.16'>Give glory to the Lord your God, before he causes darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and, while you look for light, he turns it into the shadow of death, and makes it gross darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.17'>But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for your pride; and my eye shall weep bitterly, and run down with tears, because the Lord's flock is taken captive."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.18'>"Say to the king and to the queen mother, 'Humble yourselves, sit down; for your headdresses have come down, even the crown of your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.19'>The cities toward the south are shut up, and there is none to open them: Judah is carried away captive, all of it; it is wholly carried away captive.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.20'>"Lift up your eyes, and see those who come from the north: where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.21'>What will you say, when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you? Shall not sorrows take hold of you, as of a woman in travail?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.22'>If you say in your heart, 'Why are these things come on me?' for the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts uncovered, and your heels suffer violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.23'>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may you also do good, who are accustomed to do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.24'>'Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passes away, by the wind of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.25'>This is your lot, the portion measured to you from me,' says the Lord; 'because you have forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.26'>Therefore will I also uncover your skirts on your face, and your shame shall appear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.27'>I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries, and your neighing, the lewdness of your prostitution, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, Jerusalem! You will not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?'"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.14'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.1'>The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.2'>"Judah mourns, and its gates languish, they sit in black on the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.3'>Their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are disappointed and confounded, and cover their heads.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.32.2'>Now at that time the king of Babylon's army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.3'>For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, "Why do you prophesy, and say, 'Thus says the Lord, "Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.4'>and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.5'>and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and he shall be there until I visit him," says the Lord: "though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper?"'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.6'>Jeremiah said, "The word of the Lord came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.7'>'Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you, saying, "Buy my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is yours to buy it."'</verse>

Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.9'>I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle's son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.10'>I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.11'>So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.12'>and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses who subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.13'>I commanded Baruch before them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.14'>'Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: "Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days."'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.32.21'>and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.22'>and gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.23'>and they came in, and possessed it, but they did not obey your voice, neither walked in your law; they have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do: therefore you have caused all this evil to come on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.24'>Behold, the mounds, they have come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what you have spoken has happened; and behold, you see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.25'>You have said to me, Lord God, "Buy the field for money, and call witnesses"; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.26'>Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.32.29'>and the Chaldeans, who fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.30'>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.31'>For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.32'>because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.33'>They have turned to me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.34'>But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.35'>They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through fire to Molech; which I did not command them, neither did it come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.36'>"Now therefore thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning this city, about which you say, 'It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence':</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.37'>'Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.5'>"For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah, of his God, of the Lord of hosts; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.6'>Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his life; do not be cut off in her iniquity: for it is the time of the Lord's vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.7'>Babylon has been a golden cup in the Lord's hand, who made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.8'>Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: wail for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.9'>'We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go everyone into his own country; for her judgment reaches to heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.12'>Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set the watchmen, prepare the ambushes; for the Lord has both purposed and done that which he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.17'>Every man has become brutish without knowledge. Every goldsmith is disappointed by his image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.18'>They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.19'>The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and is the tribe of his inheritance: the Lord of hosts is his name.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.30'>The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they remain in their strongholds; their might has failed; they are become as women: her dwelling places are set on fire; her bars are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.31'>One runner will run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.32'>and the passages are seized, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.33'>For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: "The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it is trodden; yet a little while, and the time of harvest shall come for her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.39'>When they are heated, I will make their feast, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake," says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.40'>"I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with male goats.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.53'>Though Babylon should mount up to the sky, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall destroyers come to her," says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.54'>"The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.55'>For the Lord lays Babylon waste, and destroys out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is uttered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.56'>for the destroyer has come on her, even on Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bows are broken in pieces; for the Lord is a God of recompenses, he will surely requite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.57'>"I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors and her deputies, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake up," says the King, whose name is the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.58'>Thus says the Lord of hosts: "The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the peoples shall labor for vanity, and the nations for the fire; and they shall be weary."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.59'>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief quartermaster.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.60'>Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.61'>Jeremiah said to Seraiah, "When you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.62'>and say, 'Lord, you have spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor animal, but that it shall be desolate forever.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.63'>It shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.64'>and you shall say, 'Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring on her; and they shall be weary.'" Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.52'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.1'>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.2'>He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.3'>For through the anger of the Lord it happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.4'>It happened in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.5'>So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.6'>In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.7'>Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were against the city all around;) and they went toward the Arabah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.8'>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.9'>Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.10'>The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he killed also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.11'>He put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.12'>Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.13'>and he burned the house of the Lord, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burned he with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.14'>All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.15'>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.16'>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.17'>The Chaldeans broke the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of the Lord in pieces, and carried all their bronze to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.18'>They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.19'>The captain of the guard took away the cups, the fire pans, the basins, the pots, the lampstands, the spoons, and the bowls; that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.20'>They took the two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of the Lord. The brass of all these vessels was without weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.21'>As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits encircled it; and its thickness was four fingers. It was hollow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.22'>A capital of brass was on it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of brass: and the second pillar also had like these, and pomegranates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.23'>There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were one hundred on the network all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.24'>The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.25'>and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and seven men of those who saw the king's face, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.26'>Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.27'>The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.28'>This is the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand twenty-three Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.29'>in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.30'>in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty-five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.31'>It happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.32'>and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.33'>and changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.34'>and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</verse>
