      <chapter osisID='Ezek.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>Now it happened in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>In the fifth of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>the word of the Lord came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was there on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with flashing lightning, and a brightness around it, and out of its midst as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>Out of its midst came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>Everyone had four faces, and each one of them had four wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>Their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and the four of them had their faces and their wings thus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>their wings were joined one to another; they didn't turn when they went; each one went straight forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and the four of them had the face of a lion on the right side; and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side; the four of them also had the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above. Two wings of each one touched another, and two covered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>Each one went straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; they didn't turn when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: the fire went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl: and the four of them had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>When they went, they went in their four directions: they didn't turn when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse, like the awesome crystal to look on, stretched forth over their heads above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>Under the expanse were their wings straight, the one toward the other: each one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of an army: when they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it all around, from the appearance of his waist and upward; and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>As the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>He said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>He said to me, "Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>The children are impudent and stiff-hearted: I am sending you to them; and you shall tell them, 'Thus says the Lord God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>They, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>You, son of man, do not be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: do not be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>But you, son of man, hear what I tell you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and eat that which I give you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>When I looked, behold, a hand was put forth to me; and, behold, a scroll of a book was therein;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>He spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>He said to me, "Son of man, eat that which you find. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the scroll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>He said to me, "Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you." Then I ate it; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>He said to me, "Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can not understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they will not listen to me: for all the house of Israel are obstinate and hard-hearted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: do not be afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>Moreover he said to me, "Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>Go to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, 'Thus says the Lord God'; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, "Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the anger of my spirit; and the hand of the Lord was strong on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>Then I came to them of the exiles at Tel Aviv, that lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>It happened at the end of seven days, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>"Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word from my mouth, and give them warning from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>When I tell the wicked, 'You shall surely die'; and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>Yet if you warn the wicked, and he doesn't turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>"Again, when a righteous man does turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die: because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>The hand of the Lord was there on me; and he said to me, "Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and behold, the glory of the Lord stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet; and he spoke with me, and said to me, "Go, shut yourself inside your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>But you, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands on you, and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, that you shall be mute, and shall not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall tell them, 'Thus says the Lord God': He who hears, let him hear; and he who forbears, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.1'>"You also, son of man, take a tile, and lay it before yourself, and portray on it a city, even Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.2'>and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.3'>Take for yourself an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city: and set your face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.4'>"Moreover lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.5'>For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days, even three hundred ninety days: so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.6'>"Again, when you have accomplished these, you shall lie on your right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.7'>You shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm uncovered; and you shall prophesy against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.8'>Behold, I lay bands on you, and you shall not turn you from one side to the other, until you have accomplished the days of your siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.9'>"Take for yourself also wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make bread of it; according to the number of the days that you shall lie on your side, even three hundred ninety days, you shall eat of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.10'>Your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time you shall eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.11'>You shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time you shall drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.12'>You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.13'>The Lord said, "Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.14'>Then I said, "Ah Lord God! Behold, my soul has not been polluted; for from my youth up even until now have I not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn of animals; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.15'>Then he said to me, "Behold, I have given you cow's dung for man's dung, and you shall prepare your bread thereon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.16'>Moreover he said to me, "Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure, and in dismay:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.17'>that they may want bread and water, and be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.1'>"You, son of man, take a sharp sword; You shall take it as a barber's razor to you, and shall cause it to pass on your head and on your beard: then take balances to weigh, and divide the hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.2'>A third part you shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and you shall take a third part, and strike with the sword around it; and a third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.3'>You shall take of it a few in number, and bind them in your skirts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.4'>Of these again you shall take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; from it shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.5'>"Thus says the Lord God: 'This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are around her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.6'>She has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her; for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.7'>"Therefore thus says the Lord God: 'Because you are turbulent more than the nations that are around you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my ordinances, neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you';</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.8'>therefore thus says the Lord God: 'Behold, I, even I, am against you; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.9'>I will do in you that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.10'>Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments on you; and the whole remnant of you will I scatter to all the winds.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.11'>"'Therefore as I live,' says the Lord God, 'surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all your abominations, therefore will I also diminish you; neither shall my eye spare, and I also will have no pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.12'>A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of you; and a third part shall fall by the sword around you; and a third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.13'>Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I shall be comforted; and they shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.14'>Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are around you, in the sight of all that pass by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.15'>So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, to the nations that are around you, when I shall execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes; (I, the Lord, have spoken it;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.16'>when I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine, that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine on you, and will break your staff of bread;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.17'>and I will send on you famine and evil animals, and they shall bereave you; and pestilence and blood shall pass through you; and I will bring the sword on you: I, the Lord, have spoken it.'"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.1'>The word of the Lord came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.2'>"Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.3'>and say, 'You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: Thus says the Lord God to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: "Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.10'>They shall know that I am the Lord: I have not said in vain that I would bring this disaster on them."'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.11'>"Thus says the Lord God: 'Strike with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, "Alas!" because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.12'>He who is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he who is near shall fall by the sword; and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my wrath on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.13'>You shall know that I am the Lord, when their slain men shall be among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered pleasant aroma to all their idols.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.7'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.1'>Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.2'>"You, son of man, thus says the Lord God to the land of Israel, 'An end: the end has come on the four corners of the land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.2'>Then I saw, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his waist and downward, fire; and from his waist and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.3'>He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the sky, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looks toward the north; where there was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.4'>Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.40'>On the one side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.41'>Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they killed the sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.42'>There were four tables for the burnt offering, of cut stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments with which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.47'>He measured the court, one hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.48'>Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.49'>The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; even by the steps by which they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.41'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.1'>He brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.2'>The breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured its length, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.3'>Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.4'>He measured its length, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said to me, "This is the most holy place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.5'>Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side room, four cubits, all around the house on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.6'>The side rooms were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side rooms all around, that they might have hold therein, and not have hold in the wall of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.7'>The side rooms were broader as they encompassed the house higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher around the house: therefore the breadth of the house continued upward; and so one went up from the lowest room to the highest by the middle room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.8'>I saw also that the house had a raised base all around: the foundations of the side rooms were a full reed of six great cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.9'>The thickness of the wall, which was for the side rooms, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged to the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.10'>Between the rooms was a breadth of twenty cubits around the house on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.11'>The doors of the side rooms were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.12'>The building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.13'>So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, one hundred cubits long;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.15'>He measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.16'>the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries around on their three stories, over against the threshold, with wood ceilings all around, and from the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.18'>It was made with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.19'>so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. Thus was it made through all the house all around:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.20'>from the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made: thus was the wall of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.21'>As for the temple, the door posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance of it was as the appearance of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.22'>The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits; and its corners, and its length, and its walls, were of wood: and he said to me, This is the table that is before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.23'>The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.24'>The doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves: two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.25'>There were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like as were made on the walls; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.26'>There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side rooms of the house, and the thresholds.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.42'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.1'>Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the room that was over against the separate place, and which was over against the building toward the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.2'>Before the length of one hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.3'>Over against the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.4'>Before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits' breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.5'>Now the upper rooms were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middle, in the building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.6'>For they were in three stories, and they didn't have pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the uppermost was straitened more than the lowest and the middle from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.7'>The wall that was outside by the side of the rooms, toward the outer court before the rooms, its length was fifty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.8'>For the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and behold, before the temple were one hundred cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.9'>From under these rooms was the entry on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.10'>In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were rooms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.11'>The way before them was like the appearance of the way of the rooms which were toward the north; according to their length so was their breadth: and all their exits were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.12'>According to the doors of the rooms that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.13'>Then he said to me, "The north rooms and the south rooms, which are before the separate place, they are the holy rooms, where the priests who are near to the Lord shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meal offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.14'>When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments in which they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertains to the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.15'>Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.16'>He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.17'>He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.18'>He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.19'>He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.20'>He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall around it, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.1'>Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.2'>Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory.</verse>
