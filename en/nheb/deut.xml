  <div type='book' osisID='Deut'>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.1'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.1'>These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>It is eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>It happened in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the Lord had given him in commandment to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.4'>after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.5'>Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>"The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have lived long enough in this mountain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all the places near there, in the Arabah, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Negev, and by the sea coast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>I spoke to you at that time, saying, "I am not able to bear you myself alone:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>The Lord your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day as the stars of the sky for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>The Lord, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>How can I myself alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.13'>Take wise men of understanding and well known according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.14'>You answered me, and said, "The thing which you have spoken is good to do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.15'>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.16'>I commanded your judges at that time, saying, "Hear cases between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.17'>You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike; you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.18'>I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.19'>We traveled from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.20'>I said to you, "You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God gives to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.21'>Behold, the Lord your God has set the land before you: go up, take possession, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you; do not be afraid, neither be dismayed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.22'>You came near to me everyone of you, and said, "Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.23'>The thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.24'>and they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.25'>They took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, "It is a good land which the Lord our God gives to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.26'>Yet you wouldn't go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.27'>and you murmured in your tents, and said, "Because the Lord hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.28'>Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, 'The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to the sky; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.29'>Then I said to you, "Do not dread, neither be afraid of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.30'>The Lord your God who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.31'>and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the Lord your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.32'>Yet in this thing you did not believe the Lord your God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.33'>who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.34'>The Lord heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.35'>"Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.36'>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he has trodden on, and to his children, because he has wholly followed the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.37'>Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying, "You also shall not go in there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.38'>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there: encourage you him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.39'>Moreover your little ones, whom you said should be a prey, and your children, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.40'>But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.41'>Then you answered and said to me, "We have sinned against the Lord, we will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord our God commanded us." Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.42'>The Lord said to me, "Tell them, 'Do not go up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest you be struck before your enemies.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.43'>So I spoke to you, and you did not listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of the Lord, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.44'>The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.45'>You returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord did not listen to your voice, nor gave ear to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.46'>So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.2'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.1'>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as the Lord spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.2'>The Lord spoke to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.3'>"You have encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.4'>Command the people, saying, 'You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: take good heed to yourselves therefore;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.5'>do not contend with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.6'>You shall purchase food of them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.7'>For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand; he has known your walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the Lord your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.8'>So we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.9'>The Lord said to me, "Do not bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.10'>(The Emim lived therein before, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.11'>these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.12'>The Horites also lived in Seir before, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the Lord gave to them.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.13'>"Now rise up, and cross over the brook Zered." We went over the brook Zered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.14'>The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea, until we had come over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as the Lord swore to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.15'>Moreover the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.16'>So it happened, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.17'>that the Lord spoke to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.18'>"You are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.19'>and when you come near over against the children of Ammon, do not bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.20'>(That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim lived therein before; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.21'>a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but the Lord destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.22'>as he did for the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.23'>and the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and lived in their place.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.24'>"Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.25'>This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.26'>I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.27'>"Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.28'>You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.29'>as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which the Lord our God gives us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.30'>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for the Lord your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as at this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.31'>The Lord said to me, "Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit his land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.32'>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.33'>The Lord our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, and his sons, and all his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.34'>We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.35'>only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.36'>From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; the Lord our God delivered up all before us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.37'>only to the land of the children of Ammon you did not come near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the Lord our God forbade us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.3'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.1'>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.2'>The Lord said to me, "Do not fear him; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.3'>So the Lord our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we struck him until none was left to him remaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.4'>We took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them; sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.5'>All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.6'>We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.7'>But all the livestock, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.8'>We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.9'>(The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.10'>We took all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.11'>(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; isn't it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, after the cubit of a man.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.12'>This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead, and its cities, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.13'>and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.14'>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.15'>I gave Gilead to Machir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.16'>To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.17'>the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.18'>I commanded you at that time, saying, "The Lord your God has given you this land to possess it: you shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel, all the men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.19'>But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.20'>until the Lord gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which the Lord your God gives them beyond the Jordan: then you shall return every man to his possession, which I have given you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.21'>I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, "Your eyes have seen all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings: so shall the Lord do to all the kingdoms where you go over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.22'>You shall not fear them; for the Lord your God, he it is who fights for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.23'>I begged the Lord at that time, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.24'>"Lord God, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your mighty acts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.25'>Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.26'>But the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, and did not listen to me; and the Lord said to me, "Let it suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.27'>Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.28'>But commission Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.29'>So we stayed in the valley over against Beth Peor.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.4'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.1'>Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, gives you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.2'>You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.3'>Your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baal Peor; for all the men who followed Baal Peor, the Lord your God has destroyed them from the midst of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.4'>But you who were faithful to the Lord your God are all alive this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.5'>Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that you should do so in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.6'>Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall hear all these statutes, and say, "Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.1'>Hear, Israel: you are to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.3'>Know therefore this day, that the Lord your God is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire; he will destroy them, and he will bring them down before you: so you shall drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as the Lord has spoken to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.4'>Do not say in your heart, after the Lord your God has thrust them out from before you, saying, "For my righteousness the Lord has brought me in to possess this land"; because the Lord drives them out before you because of the wickedness of these nations.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.6'>Know therefore, that the Lord your God doesn't give you this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.7'>Remember, do not forget, how you provoked the Lord your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt, until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.8'>Also in Horeb you provoked the Lord to wrath, and the Lord was angry with you to destroy you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.9'>When I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.10'>The Lord delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them were all the words which the Lord spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.11'>It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the Lord gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.15'>So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.16'>I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the Lord your God; you had made yourselves a molten calf: you had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Lord had commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.17'>I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.18'>I fell down before the Lord, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water; because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.20'>The Lord was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.21'>I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.22'>At Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah, you provoked the Lord to wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.23'>When the Lord sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, "Go up and possess the land which I have given you"; then you rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God, and you did not believe him, nor listen to his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.24'>You have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.25'>So I fell down before the Lord the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because the Lord had said he would destroy you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.26'>I prayed to the Lord, and said, "Lord God, do not destroy your people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.27'>Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not look to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.28'>lest the land you brought us out from say, 'Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.'</verse>
