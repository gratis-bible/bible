  <div type='book' osisID='2Sam'>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.1'>It happened after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.2'>it happened on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and showed respect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.3'>David said to him, "Where do you come from?"He said to him, "I have escaped out of the camp of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.4'>David said to him, "How did it go? Please tell me."He answered, "The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.5'>David said to the young man who told him, "How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.6'>The young man who told him said, "As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.7'>When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, 'Here I am.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.8'>He said to me, 'Who are you?' I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.9'>He said to me, 'Please stand beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.10'>So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.11'>Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.12'>They mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.13'>David said to the young man who told him, "Where are you from?"He answered, "I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.14'>David said to him, "How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the Lord's anointed?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.15'>David called one of the young men, and said, "Go near, and fall on him." He struck him, so that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.16'>David said to him, "Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have slain the Lord's anointed.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.17'>David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.18'>(and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.19'>"Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places!How the mighty have fallen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.20'>Do not tell it in Gath.Do not publish it in the streets of Ashkelon,lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.21'>You mountains of Gilboa,let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings;For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,The shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.22'>From the blood of the slain,from the fat of the mighty,Jonathan's bow did not turn back.Saul's sword did not return empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.23'>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives.In their death, they were not divided.They were swifter than eagles.They were stronger than lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.24'>You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,who clothed you in scarlet delicately,who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.25'>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!Jonathan is slain on your high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.26'>I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan.You have been very pleasant to me.Your love to me was wonderful,passing the love of women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.27'>How are the mighty fallen,and the weapons of war perished!"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.1'>It happened after this, that David inquired of the Lord, saying, "Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?"The Lord said to him, "Go up."David said, "Where shall I go up?"He said, "To Hebron."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.2'>So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.3'>David brought up his men who were with him, every man with his household. They lived in the cities of Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.4'>The men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told David, saying, "The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.5'>David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, "Blessed are you by the Lord, that you have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.6'>Now may the Lord show loving kindness and truth to you. I also will reward you for this kindness, because you have done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.7'>Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.8'>Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's army, had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.9'>and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.10'>Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.11'>The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.12'>Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.13'>Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.14'>Abner said to Joab, "Please let the young men arise and play before us!"Joab said, "Let them arise!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.15'>Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.16'>They each caught his opponent by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.17'>The battle was very severe that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.18'>The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.19'>Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he did not turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.20'>Then Abner looked behind him, and said, "Is it you, Asahel?"He answered, "It is I."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.21'>Abner said to him, "Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and grab one of the young men, and take his armor." But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.22'>Abner said again to Asahel, "Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.23'>However he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner with the back end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place. It happened, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.24'>But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.25'>The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.26'>Then Abner called to Joab, and said, "Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, before you ask the people to return from following their brothers?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.27'>Joab said, "As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone away, and not each followed his brother."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.28'>So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.29'>Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.30'>Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.31'>But the servants of David had struck of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred sixty men died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.32'>They took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem. Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.1'>Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David grew stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.2'>To David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.3'>and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.4'>and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.5'>and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.6'>It happened, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.7'>Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, "Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.8'>Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, "Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me this day with a fault concerning this woman!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.9'>God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as the Lord has sworn to David, I do not do even so to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.10'>to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.11'>He could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.12'>Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, "Whose is the land?" and saying, "Make your alliance with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring all Israel around to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.13'>He said, "Good; I will make a treaty with you; but one thing I require of you. That is, you shall not see my face, unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.14'>David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying, "Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I pledged to be married to me for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.15'>Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.16'>Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go! Return!" and he returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.17'>Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, "In times past, you sought for David to be king over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.18'>Now then do it; for the Lord has spoken of David, saying, 'By the hand of my servant David, I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.19'>Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.20'>So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.21'>Abner said to David, "I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires." David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.22'>Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.23'>When Joab and all the army who was with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.24'>Then Joab came to the king, and said, "What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.25'>You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.26'>When Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David did not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.27'>When Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.28'>Afterward, when David heard it, he said, "I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.29'>Let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house. Let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.30'>So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.31'>David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him, Tear your clothes, and clothe yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. King David followed the bier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.32'>They buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.33'>The king lamented for Abner, and said, "Should Abner die as a fool dies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.34'>Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters. As a man falls before the children of iniquity, so you fell."All the people wept again over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.35'>All the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, "God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun goes down."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.36'>All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.37'>So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.38'>The king said to his servants, "Do you not know that there a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.39'>I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. May the Lord reward the evildoer according to his wickedness."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.1'>When Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.2'>Saul's son had two men who were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.3'>and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners there until this day).</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.4'>Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.5'>The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, as he took his rest at noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.6'>They came there into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.7'>Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him, and killed him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.8'>They brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, "Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life! The Lord has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.9'>David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, "As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.10'>when someone told me, 'Behold, Saul is dead,' thinking to have brought good news, I took hold of him, and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.11'>How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.12'>David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.1'>Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, "Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.2'>In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. The Lord said to you, 'You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.3'>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord; and they anointed David king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.4'>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</verse>

Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.12'>David said to Uriah, "Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart." So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.13'>When David had called him, he ate and drink before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but did not go down to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.14'>It happened in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.15'>He wrote in the letter, saying, "Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck, and die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.16'>It happened, when Joab kept watch on the city, that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.17'>The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.18'>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.19'>and he commanded the messenger, saying, "When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.20'>it shall be that, if the king's wrath arise, and he asks you, 'Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.21'>who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did a woman not cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?' Then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.22'>So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.23'>The messenger said to David, "The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.24'>The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king's servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.25'>Then David said to the messenger, "Thus you shall tell Joab, 'Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.' Encourage him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.26'>When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.27'>When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.1'>The Lord sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, "There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.2'>The rich man had very many flocks and herds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.3'>but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him, and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him like a daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.4'>A traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man who had come to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.5'>David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, "As the Lord lives, the man who has done this is worthy to die!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.6'>He shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.7'>Nathan said to David, "You are the man. This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.8'>I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.9'>Why have you despised the word of the Lord, to do that which is evil in his sight? You have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.10'>Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.15'>Nathan departed to his house.The Lord struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.16'>David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.17'>The elders of his house arose beside him, to raise him up from the ground: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.18'>It happened on the seventh day, that the child died. The servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, "Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to our voice. How will he then harm himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.19'>But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, "Is the child dead?"They said, "He is dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.20'>Then David arose from the ground, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing; and he came into the house of the Lord, and worshiped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.21'>Then his servants said to him, "What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child was dead, you rose up and ate bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.22'>He said, "While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, 'Who knows whether the Lord will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.23'>But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.24'>David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. She bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. The Lord loved him;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.29'>David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.30'>He took the crown of their king from off his head; and its weight was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David's head. He brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.31'>He brought out the people who were therein, and put them under saws, and under iron picks, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln: and he did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.1'>It happened after this, that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.2'>Amnon was so troubled that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.3'>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.4'>He said to him, "Why, son of the king, are you so sad from day to day? Won't you tell me?"Amnon said to him, "I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.5'>Jonadab said to him, "Lie down on your bed, and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, tell him, 'Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.6'>So Amnon lay down and faked being sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, "Please let my sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.7'>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, "Go now to your brother Amnon's house, and prepare food for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.8'>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. She took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.9'>She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, "Have all men leave me." Every man went out from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.10'>Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food into the room, that I may eat from your hand." Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.11'>When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, "Come, lie with me, my sister!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.12'>She answered him, "No, my brother, do not force me! For no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Do not do this folly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.13'>I, where would I carry my shame? And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.14'>However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.15'>Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, "Arise, be gone!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.16'>She said to him, "Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me!"But he would not listen to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.17'>Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, "Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.18'>She had a garment of various colors on her; for with such robes were the king's daughters who were virgins dressed. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.19'>Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.20'>Absalom her brother said to her, "Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother. Do not take this thing to heart."So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.21'>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.22'>Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.23'>It happened after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.24'>Absalom came to the king, and said, "See now, your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.25'>The king said to Absalom, "No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you." He pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.26'>Then Absalom said, "If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us."The king said to him, "Why should he go with you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.27'>But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.28'>Absalom commanded his servants, saying, "Mark now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, 'Strike Amnon,' then kill him. Do not be afraid. Haven't I commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.29'>The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got up on his mule, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.30'>It happened, while they were in the way, that the news came to David, saying, "Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.31'>Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the ground; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.32'>Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered, "Do not let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.33'>Now therefore do not let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.34'>But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.35'>Jonadab said to the king, "Behold, the king's sons are coming! It is as your servant said."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.36'>It happened, as soon as he had finished speaking, that behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept. The king also and all his servants wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.37'>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.38'>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.39'>King David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.14'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.1'>Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.2'>Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched there a wise woman, and said to her, "Please act like a mourner, and put on mourning clothing, please, and do not anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman who has mourned a long time for the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.3'>Go in to the king, and speak like this to him." So Joab put the words in her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.4'>When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, showed respect, and said, "Help, O king!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.5'>The king said to her, "What ails you?"She answered, "Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.6'>Your handmaid had two sons, and they both fought together in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one struck the other, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.7'>Behold, the whole family has risen against your handmaid, and they say, 'Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir also.' Thus they would quench my coal which is left, and would leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the surface of the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.8'>The king said to the woman, "Go to your house, and I will give a command concerning you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.9'>The woman of Tekoa said to the king, "My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house; and the king and his throne be guiltless."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.10'>The king said, "Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you any more."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.11'>Then she said, "Please let the king remember the Lord your God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son."He said, "As the Lord lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.12'>Then the woman said, "Please let your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king."He said, "Say on."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.13'>The woman said, "Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring home again his banished one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.14'>For we must die, and are as water split on the ground, which can't be gathered up again; neither does God take away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be an outcast from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.15'>Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and your handmaid said, 'I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.16'>For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.17'>Then your handmaid said, 'Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad. May the Lord, your God, be with you.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.18'>Then the king answered the woman, "Please do not hide anything from me that I ask you."The woman said, "Let my lord the king now speak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.19'>The king said, "Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?"The woman answered, "As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab, he urged me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.20'>to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing. My lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.21'>The king said to Joab, "Behold now, I have done this thing. Go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.22'>Joab fell to the ground on his face, showed respect, and blessed the king. Joab said, "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.23'>So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.24'>The king said, "Let him return to his own house, but let him not see my face." So Absalom returned to his own house, and did not see the king's face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.25'>Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.26'>When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year's end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king's weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.27'>To Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a beautiful face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.28'>Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem; and he did not see the king's face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.29'>Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.30'>Therefore he said to his servants, "Behold, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire." Absalom's servants set the field on fire. [And the servants of Joab came to him with their clothes rent, and they said to him, "The servants of Absalom have set the field on fire."]</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.31'>Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.32'>Absalom answered Joab, "Behold, I sent to you, saying, 'Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, "Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me."'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.33'>So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.15'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.1'>It happened after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.2'>Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate. It was so, that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, "What city are you from?"He said, "Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.3'>Absalom said to him, "Behold, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputized by the king to hear you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.4'>Absalom said moreover, "Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.5'>It was so, that when any man came near to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.6'>Absalom did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.7'>It happened at the end of forty years, that Absalom said to the king, "Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the Lord, in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.8'>For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, 'If the Lord shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve the Lord.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.9'>The king said to him, "Go in peace."So he arose, and went to Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.10'>But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, 'Absalom is king in Hebron!'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.11'>Two hundred men went with Absalom out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they did not know anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.12'>Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. The conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.13'>A messenger came to David, saying, "The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.14'>David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, "Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom. Make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.15'>The king's servants said to the king, "Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.16'>The king went forth, and all his household after him. The king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.17'>The king went forth, and all the people after him; and they stayed in Beth Merhak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.18'>All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.19'>Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why do you also go with us? Return, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile. Return to your own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.20'>Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us, since I go where I may? Return, and take back your brothers. Mercy and truth be with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.21'>Ittai answered the king, and said, "As the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall is, whether for death or for life, even there also will your servant be."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.22'>David said to Ittai, "Go and pass over." Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.23'>All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.24'>Behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people finished passing out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.25'>The king said to Zadok, "Carry back the ark of God into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.26'>but if he say thus, 'I have no delight in you;' behold, here am I. Let him do to me as seems good to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.27'>The king said also to Zadok the priest, "Aren't you a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.28'>Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.29'>Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem; and they stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.30'>David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people who were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.31'>Someone told David, saying, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom."David said, "Lord, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.32'>It happened that when David had come to the top, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn, and earth on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.33'>David said to him, "If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.34'>but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king. As I have been your father's servant in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.35'>Do you not have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you? Therefore it shall be, that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.36'>Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.37'>So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.16'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.1'>When David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.2'>The king said to Ziba, "What do you mean by these?" Ziba said, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.3'>The king said, "Where is your master's son?"Ziba said to the king, "Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem; for he said, 'Today the house of Israel will restore me the kingdom of my father.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.4'>Then the king said to Ziba, "Behold, all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours."Ziba said, "I do obeisance. Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.5'>When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of the house of Saul came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out, and cursed still as he came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.6'>He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.7'>Shimei said when he cursed, "Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, and base fellow!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.8'>The Lord has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned! The Lord has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son! Behold, you are caught by your own mischief, because you are a man of blood!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.9'>Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.10'>The king said, "What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because the Lord has said to him, 'Curse David;' who then shall say, 'Why have you done so?'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.11'>David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, "Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life. How much more this Benjamite, now? Leave him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord has invited him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.12'>It may be that the Lord will look on the wrong done to me, and that the Lord will repay me good for the cursing of me today."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.13'>So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him, and cursed as he went, threw stones at him, and threw dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.14'>The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.15'>Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.16'>It happened, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, had come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.17'>Absalom said to Hushai, "Is this your kindness to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.18'>Hushai said to Absalom, "No; but whomever the Lord, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him I will stay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.19'>Again, whom should I serve? Shouldn't I serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father's presence, so will I be in your presence."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.20'>Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give your counsel what we shall do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.21'>Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Go in to your father's concubines, that he has left to keep the house. Then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.22'>So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.23'>The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.17'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.1'>Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David tonight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.2'>I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will make him afraid. All the people who are with him shall flee. I will strike the king only;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.3'>and I will bring back all the people to you. The man whom you seek is as if all returned. All the people shall be in peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.4'>The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.5'>Then Absalom said, "Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.6'>When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, "Ahithophel has spoken like this. Shall we do what he says? If not, speak up."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.7'>Hushai said to Absalom, "The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.8'>Hushai said moreover, "You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.9'>Behold, he is now hidden in some pit, or in some other place. It will happen, when some of them have fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, 'There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.10'>Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.11'>But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.12'>So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.13'>Moreover, if he be gone into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there isn't one small stone found there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.14'>Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel." For the Lord had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the Lord might bring evil on Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.15'>Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, "Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way; and I have counseled this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.16'>Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, 'Do not lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.17'>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David. For they might not be seen to come into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.18'>But a boy saw them, and told Absalom. Then they both went away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.19'>The woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and spread out bruised grain on it; and nothing was known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.20'>Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?"The woman said to them, "They have gone over the brook of water."When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.21'>It happened, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, "Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.22'>Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan. By the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.23'>When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and went home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.24'>Then David came to Mahanaim. Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.25'>Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.26'>Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.27'>It happened, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.28'>brought beds, basins, earthen vessels, wheat, barley, meal, parched grain, beans, lentils, roasted grain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.29'>honey, butter, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat: for they said, "The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.18'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.1'>David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.2'>David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the people, "I will surely go forth with you myself also."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.3'>But the people said, "You shall not go forth; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.4'>The king said to them, "I will do what seems best to you."The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.5'>The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, "Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom." All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.6'>So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.7'>The people of Israel were struck there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.8'>For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.9'>Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.10'>A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, "Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.11'>Joab said to the man who told him, "Behold, you saw it, and why did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a sash."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.12'>The man said to Joab, "Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still wouldn't put forth my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, 'Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.13'>Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hidden from the king), then you yourself would have set yourself against me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.14'>Then Joab said, "I'm not going to wait like this with you." He took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.15'>Ten young men who bore Joab's armor surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.16'>Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.17'>They took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. Then all Israel fled everyone to his tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.18'>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale; for he said, "I have no son to keep my name in memory." He called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom's monument, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.19'>Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, "Let me now run, and bear the king news, how that the Lord has avenged him of his enemies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.20'>Joab said to him, "You shall not be the bearer of news this day, but you shall bear news another day. But today you shall bear no news, because the king's son is dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.21'>Then Joab said to the Cushite, "Go, tell the king what you have seen!" The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.22'>Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, "But come what may, please let me also run after the Cushite."Joab said, "Why do you want to run, my son, since that you will have no reward for the news?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.23'>"But come what may," he said, "I will run."He said to him, "Run!" Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.24'>Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.25'>The watchman cried, and told the king. The king said, "If he is alone, there is news in his mouth." He came closer and closer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.26'>The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the porter, and said, "Behold, a man running alone!"The king said, "He also brings news."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.27'>The watchman said, "I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok."The king said, "He is a good man, and comes with good news."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.28'>Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, "All is well." He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, "Blessed is the Lord your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.29'>The king said, "Is it well with the young man Absalom?"Ahimaaz answered, "When Joab sent the king's servant, even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I do not know what it was."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.30'>The king said, "Turn aside, and stand here." He turned aside, and stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.31'>Behold, the Cushite came. The Cushite said, "News for my lord the king; for the Lord has avenged you this day of all those who rose up against you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.32'>The king said to the Cushite, "Is it well with the young man Absalom?"The Cushite answered, "May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you to do you harm, be as that young man is."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.33'>The king was much moved, and went up to the room over the gate, and wept. As he went, he said, "My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died for you, Absalom, my son, my son!"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.23'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.1'>Now these are the last words of David.David the son of Jesse says,the man who was raised on high says,the anointed of the God of Jacob,the sweet psalmist of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.2'>"The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me.His word was on my tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.3'>The God of Israel said,the Rock of Israel spoke to me,'One who rules over men righteously,who rules in the fear of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.4'>shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun rises,a morning without clouds,when the tender grass springs out of the earth,through clear shining after rain.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.5'>Most certainly my house is not so with God,yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant,ordered in all things, and sure,for it is all my salvation, and all my desire,although he doesn't make it grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.6'>But all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away,because they can't be taken with the hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.7'>But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear.They shall be utterly burned with fire in their place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.8'>These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.9'>After him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.10'>He arose, and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand froze to the sword; and the Lord worked a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to take spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.11'>After him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. The Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.12'>But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and the Lord worked a great victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.13'>Three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.14'>David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.15'>David longed, and said, "Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.16'>The three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.17'>He said, "Be it far from me, Lord, that I should do this! Isn't it the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives?" Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.18'>Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. He lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.19'>Wasn't he most honorable of the three? Therefore he was made their captain: however he did not attain to the three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.20'>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.21'>He killed an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.22'>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.23'>He was more honorable than the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. David set him over his guard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.24'>Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.24'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.1'>Again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, "Go, number Israel and Judah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.2'>The king said to Joab the captain of the army, who was with him, "Now go back and forth through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number the people, that I may know the sum of the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.3'>Joab said to the king, "Now may the Lord your God add to the people, however many they may be, one hundred times; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king delight in this thing?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.4'>Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the army. Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.5'>They passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.6'>then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; and they came to Dan Jaan, and around to Sidon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.7'>and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beersheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.8'>So when they had gone back and forth through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.9'>Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.10'>David's heart struck him after that he had numbered the people. David said to the Lord, "I have sinned greatly in that which I have done. But now, Lord, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.11'>When David rose up in the morning, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.12'>"Go and speak to David, 'Thus says the Lord, "I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you."'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.13'>So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, "Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days' pestilence in your land? Now answer, and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.14'>David said to Gad, "I am in distress. Let us fall now into the hand of the Lord; for his mercies are great. Let me not fall into the hand of man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.15'>So the Lord sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the appointed time; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.16'>When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord relented of the disaster, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, "It is enough. Now stay your hand." The angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.17'>David spoke to the Lord when he saw the angel who struck the people, and said, "Behold, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand be against me, and against my father's house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.18'>Gad came that day to David, and said to him, "Go up, build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.19'>David went up according to the saying of Gad, as the Lord commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.20'>Araunah looked out, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. Then Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.21'>Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?"David said, "To buy your threshing floor, to build an altar to the Lord, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.22'>Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Behold, the cattle for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.23'>all this, king, does Araunah give to the king." Araunah said to the king, "May the Lord your God accept you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.24'>The king said to Araunah, "No; but I will most certainly buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God which cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.25'>David built an altar to the Lord there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the Lord was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</verse>
