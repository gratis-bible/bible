        <verse osisID='Lev.1.13'>but the innards and the legs he shall wash with water. The priest shall offer the whole, and burn it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.14'>"'If his offering to the Lord is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall offer his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.2.15'>You shall put oil on it, and lay frankincense on it: it is a meal offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.16'>The priest shall burn as its memorial, part of its bruised grain, and part of its oil, along with all its frankincense: it is an offering made by fire to the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.26.43'>The land also will be left by them, and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them: and they will accept the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.44'>Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am the Lord their God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.45'>but I will for their sake remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am the Lord.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.46'>These are the statutes, ordinances and laws, which the Lord made between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.27.1'>The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.2'>"Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, 'When a man makes a vow, the persons shall be for the Lord by your valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.3'>Your valuation shall be of a male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.4'>If it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.5'>If the person is from five years old even to twenty years old, then your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.6'>If the person is from a month old even to five years old, then your valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver, and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.7'>If the person is from sixty years old and upward; if it is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.8'>But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.9'>"'If it is an animal, of which men offer an offering to the Lord, all that any man gives of such to the Lord becomes holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.10'>He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.11'>If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer as an offering to the Lord, then he shall set the animal before the priest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.12'>and the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad. As you the priest values it, so shall it be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.13'>But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to its valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.14'>"'When a man dedicates his house to be holy to the Lord, then the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad: as the priest shall evaluate it, so shall it stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.15'>If he who dedicates it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.16'>"'If a man dedicates to the Lord part of the field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it: the sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.17'>If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.18'>But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the Year of Jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from your valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.19'>If he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall remain his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.20'>If he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.21'>but the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy to the Lord, as a field devoted; it shall be owned by the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.22'>"'If he dedicates to the Lord a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.23'>then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee; and he shall give your valuation on that day, as a holy thing to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.24'>In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.25'>All your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs to the shekel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.26'>"'Only the firstborn among animals, which is made a firstborn to the Lord, no man may dedicate it; whether an ox or sheep, it is the Lord's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.27'>If it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back according to your valuation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it: or if it isn't redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.28'>"'Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the Lord of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.29'>"'No one devoted, who shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.30'>"'All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is the Lord's. It is holy to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.31'>If a man redeems anything of his tithe, he shall add a fifth part to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.32'>All the tithe of the herds or the flocks, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.33'>He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he changes it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy. It shall not be redeemed.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.34'>These are the commandments which the Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai.</verse>
