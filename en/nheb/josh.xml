      <chapter osisID='Josh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'>Now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' servant, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'>Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you, and all this people, to the land which I give to them, even to the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'>I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will tread on, as I told Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'>From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'>No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'>Be strong and of good courage; for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'>Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'>This scroll of the Law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'>Haven't I commanded you? Be strong and of good courage. Do not be afraid, neither be dismayed: for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'>"Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, 'Prepare food; for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God gives you to possess it.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'>Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'>"Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, 'The Lord your God gives you rest, and will give you this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'>Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock, shall live in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but you shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'>until the Lord has given your brothers rest, as he has given you, and they have also possessed the land which the Lord your God gives them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'>They answered Joshua, saying, "All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'>Just as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you. Only may the Lord your God be with you, as he was with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'>Whoever rebels against your commandment, and doesn't listen to your words in all that you command him, he shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'>Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of Shittim as spies, saying, "Go, view the land, and Jericho." They went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and slept there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'>The king of Jericho was told, "Behold, men of the children of Israel came in here tonight to spy out the land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'>The king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, "Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered into your house; for they have come to spy out all the land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'>The woman took the two men and hid them. Then she said, "Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they came from.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'>It happened about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out. Where the men went, I do not know. Pursue them quickly; for you will overtake them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'>But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'>The men pursued them the way to the Jordan to the fords: and as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'>Before they had lain down, she came up to them on the roof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.9'>and she said to the men, "I know that the Lord has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'>For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'>As soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for the Lord your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'>Now therefore, please swear to me by the Lord, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a true token;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'>and that you will save alive my father, my mother, my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'>The men said to her, "Our life for yours, if you do not talk about this business of ours; and it shall be, when the Lord gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'>Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived on the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'>She said to them, "Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward, you may go your way."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'>The men said to her, "We will be guiltless of this your oath which you have made us to swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'>Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by. You shall gather to yourself into the house your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father's household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'>It shall be that whoever goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be guiltless. Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand is on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'>But if you talk about this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to swear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'>She said, "According to your words, so be it." She sent them away, and they departed. She tied the scarlet line in the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'>They went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but did not find them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'>Then the two men returned, descended from the mountain, passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had happened to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'>They said to Joshua, "Truly the Lord has delivered into our hands all the land. Moreover, all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'>Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they moved from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel. They lodged there before they passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'>It happened after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'>and they commanded the people, saying, "When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall move from your place, and follow it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'>Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near to it, that you may know the way by which you must go; for you have not passed this way before."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'>Joshua said to the people, "Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'>Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people." They took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'>The Lord said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'>You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, 'When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'>Joshua said to the children of Israel, "Come here, and hear the words of the Lord your God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'>Joshua said, "Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite out from before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'>Now therefore take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'>It shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, even the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in one heap."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'>It happened, when the people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant being before the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'>and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'>that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people passed over right against Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'>The priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan; and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation had passed completely over the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'>It happened, when all the nation had completely passed over the Jordan, that the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'>"Take twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'>and command them, saying, 'Take from out of the middle of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging place, where you will lodge tonight.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'>Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'>Joshua said to them, "Pass over before the ark of the Lord your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you pick up a stone and put it on your shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'>that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask in time to come, saying, 'What do you mean by these stones?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'>then you shall tell them, 'Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord. When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'>The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as the Lord spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'>Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'>For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan, until everything was finished that the Lord commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'>It happened, when all the people had completely passed over, that the ark of the Lord passed over, with the priests, in the presence of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'>The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'>About forty thousand men, ready and armed for war passed over before the Lord to battle, to the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'>On that day, the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.15'>The Lord spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.16'>"Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.17'>Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, "Come up out of the Jordan!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.18'>It happened, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord had come up out of the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went over all its banks, as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.19'>The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.20'>Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.21'>He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, "When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, 'What do these stones mean?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.22'>Then you shall let your children know, saying, 'Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.23'>For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until you had passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had passed over;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.24'>that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty; that you may fear the Lord your God forever.'"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'>It happened, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we had passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'>At that time, the Lord said to Joshua, "Make flint knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.3'>Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the Hill of the Foreskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.4'>This is the reason Joshua circumcised: all the people who came out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.5'>For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.6'>For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, even the men of war who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not listen to the voice of the Lord. The Lord swore to them that he wouldn't let them see the land which the Lord swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.7'>Their children, whom he raised up in their place, were circumcised by Joshua; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.8'>It happened, when they were done circumcising all the nation, that they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.9'>The Lord said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you." Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.10'>The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal. They kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.11'>They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.12'>The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land. The children of Israel did not have manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.13'>It happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him, and said to him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.14'>He said, "No; but I have come now as captain of the Lord's host."Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him, "What does my lord say to his servant?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.15'>The captain of the Lord's host said to Joshua, "Take your shoes off of your feet; for the place on which you stand is holy." Joshua did so.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.1'>Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel. No one went out, and no one came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.2'>The Lord said to Joshua, "Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and the mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.3'>All your men of war shall march around the city, going around the city once. You shall do this six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.4'>Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark. On the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.5'>It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.6'>Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.7'>They said to the people, "Advance! March around the city, and let the armed men pass on before the Lord's ark."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.8'>It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the Lord advanced, and blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.9'>The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the ark went after them. The trumpets sounded as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.10'>Joshua commanded the people, saying, "You shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.11'>So he caused the ark of the Lord to go around the city, going about it once. Then they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.12'>Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.13'>The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord went on continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them. The rear guard came after the ark of the Lord. The trumpets sounded as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.14'>The second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. They did this six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.15'>It happened on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times. Only on this day they marched around the city seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.16'>It happened at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, "Shout, for the Lord has given you the city!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.17'>The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to the Lord. Only Rahab the prostitute shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.18'>But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing; so would you make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.19'>But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy to the Lord. They shall come into the Lord's treasury."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.20'>So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets. It happened, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.21'>They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.22'>Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, "Go into the prostitute's house, and bring out from there the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.23'>The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. They also brought out all her relatives, and they set them outside of the camp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.24'>They burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of the Lord's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.25'>But Rahab the prostitute, her father's household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive. She lived in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.26'>Joshua commanded them with an oath at that time, saying, "Cursed be the man before the Lord, who rises up and builds this city Jericho. With the loss of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up its gates."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.27'>So the Lord was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.1'>But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. Therefore the Lord's anger burned against the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.2'>Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, "Go up and spy out the land."The men went up and spied out Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.3'>They returned to Joshua, and said to him, "Do not let all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Do not make all the people to toil there, for there are only a few of them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.4'>So about three thousand men of the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.5'>The men of Ai struck about thirty-six men of them, and they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck them at the descent. The hearts of the people melted, and became like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.6'>Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.7'>Joshua said, "Alas, Lord God, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? I wish that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.8'>Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.9'>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. What will you do for your great name?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.10'>The Lord said to Joshua, "Get up! Why are you fallen on your face like that?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.11'>Israel has sinned. Yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. Yes, they have even taken of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and also deceived. They have even put it among their own stuff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.12'>Therefore the children of Israel can't stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will not be with you any more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.13'>Get up! Sanctify the people, and say, 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for the Lord, the God of Israel, says, "There is a devoted thing in the midst of you, Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted thing from among you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.14'>In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes. It shall be that the tribe which the Lord selects shall come near by families. The family which the Lord selects shall come near by households. The household which the Lord selects shall come near man by man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.15'>It shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.16'>So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes. The tribe of Judah was selected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.17'>He brought near the family of Judah; and he selected the family of the Zerahites. He brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was selected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.18'>He brought near his household man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.19'>Joshua said to Achan, "My son, please give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make confession to him. Tell me now what you have done! Do not hide it from me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.20'>Achan answered Joshua, and said, "I have truly sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and this is what I have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.21'>When I saw among the spoil a beautiful Babylonian robe, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them and took them. Behold, they are hidden in the ground in the middle of my tent, with the silver under it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.22'>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. Behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.23'>They took them from the middle of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel. They laid them down before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.24'>Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.25'>Joshua said, "Why have you troubled us? The Lord will trouble you this day." All Israel stoned him with stones, and they burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.26'>They raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. The Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called "The valley of Achor" to this day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.8'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.1'>The Lord said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid, neither be dismayed. Take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai. Behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, with his people, his city, and his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.2'>You shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king, except its spoil and its livestock, you shall take for a plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.3'>So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them out by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.4'>He commanded them, saying, "Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.5'>I, and all the people who are with me, will approach to the city. It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.6'>They will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, 'They flee before us, like the first time.' So we will flee before them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.7'>and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city; for the Lord your God will deliver it into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.8'>It shall be, when you have seized on the city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do this according to the word of the Lord. Behold, I have commanded you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.9'>Joshua sent them out; and they went to set up the ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua stayed among the people that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.10'>Joshua rose up early in the morning, mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.11'>All the people, even the men of war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.12'>He took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.13'>So they set the people, even all the army who was on the north of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.14'>It happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.15'>Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.16'>All the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them. They pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.17'>There was not a man left in Ai or Beth El who did not go out after Israel. They left the city open, and pursued Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.18'>The Lord said to Joshua, "Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand."Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.19'>The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it. They hurried and set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.20'>When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way. The people who fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.21'>When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and killed the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.22'>The others came out of the city against them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. They struck them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.23'>They captured the king of Ai alive, and brought him to Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.24'>It happened, when Israel had made an end of killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to Ai, and struck it with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.25'>All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.26'>For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.27'>Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey to themselves, according to the word of the Lord which he commanded Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.28'>So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.29'>He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until the evening, and at the sundown Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised a great heap of stones on it that remains to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.30'>Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.31'>as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the scroll of the Law of Moses, "an altar of uncut stones, on which no man has touched with an iron tool." They offered burnt offerings on it to the Lord, and sacrificed peace offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.32'>He wrote there on the stones a copy of the Law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.33'>All Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, who carried the ark of the Lord's covenant, the foreigner as well as the native; half of them in front of Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.34'>Afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the scroll of the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.35'>There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who were among them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.9'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.1'>It happened, when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard of it</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.2'>that they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.3'>But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.4'>they also resorted to a ruse, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their donkeys, and wineskins, old and torn and bound up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.5'>and old and patched shoes on their feet, and wore old garments. All the bread of their provision was dry and moldy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.6'>They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, "We have come from a far country. Now therefore make a covenant with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.7'>The men of Israel said to the Hivites, "What if you live among us. How could we make a covenant with you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.8'>They said to Joshua, "We are your servants."Joshua said to them, "Who are you? Where do you come from?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.9'>They said to him, "Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of the Lord your God; for we have heard of his fame, all that he did in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.10'>and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.11'>Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, 'Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and tell them, "We are your servants. Now make a covenant with us."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.12'>This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and has become moldy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.13'>These wineskins, which we filled, were new; and behold, they are torn. These our garments and our shoes have become old because of the very long journey."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.14'>The men sampled their provisions, and did not ask counsel from the mouth of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.15'>Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live. The princes of the congregation swore to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.16'>It happened at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they lived among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.17'>The children of Israel traveled and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.18'>The children of Israel did not strike them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by the Lord, the God of Israel. All the congregation murmured against the princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.19'>But all the princes said to all the congregation, "We have sworn to them by the Lord, the God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.20'>This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.21'>The princes said to them, "Let them live, so they became wood cutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.22'>Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, "Why have you deceived us, saying, 'We are very far from you,' when you live among us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.23'>Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you will never fail to be bondservants, both wood cutters and drawers of water for the house of my God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.24'>They answered Joshua, and said, "Because your servants were certainly told how the Lord your God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you. Therefore we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.25'>Now, behold, we are in your hand. Do to us as it seems good and right to you to do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.26'>He did so to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they did not kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.27'>That day Joshua made them wood cutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord, to this day, in the place which he should choose.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.10'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.1'>Now it happened when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.2'>that they were very afraid, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.3'>Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.4'>"Come up to me, and help me, and let us strike Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.5'>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.6'>The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, "Do not abandon your servants! Come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country have gathered together against us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.7'>So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.8'>The Lord said to Joshua, "Do not fear them, for I have delivered them into your hands. Not a man of them will stand before you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.9'>Joshua therefore came on them suddenly. He went up from Gilgal all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.10'>The Lord confused them before Israel, and he killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to Azekah and to Makkedah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.11'>It happened, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth Horon, that the Lord cast down great stones from the sky on them to Azekah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than who the children of Israel killed with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.12'>Then Joshua spoke to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, "Sun, stand still on Gibeon! You, moon, stop in the valley of Aijalon!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.13'>The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Isn't this written in the book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the midst of the sky, and did not hurry to go down about a whole day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.14'>There was no day like that before it or after it, that the Lord listened to the voice of a man; for the Lord fought for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.15'>Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.16'>These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.17'>Joshua was told, saying, "The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.18'>Joshua said, "Roll large stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.19'>but do not stay. Pursue your enemies, and attack them from the rear. Do not allow them to enter into their cities; for the Lord your God has delivered them into your hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.20'>It happened, when Joshua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.21'>that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.22'>Then Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out of the cave to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.23'>They did so, and brought those five kings out of the cave to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.24'>It happened, when they brought those kings out to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him, "Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings."They came near, and put their feet on their necks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.25'>Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed. Be strong and of good courage, for the Lord will do this to all your enemies against whom you fight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.26'>Afterward Joshua struck them, put them to death, and hanged them on five trees. They were hanging on the trees until the evening.</verse>
