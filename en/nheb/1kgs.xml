  <div type='book' osisID='1Kgs'>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he couldn't keep warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>Therefore his servants said to him, "Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin. Let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king did not know her intimately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, "I will be king." Then he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>His father had not displeased him at any time in saying, "Why have you done so?" and he was also a very handsome man; and he was born after Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>Adonijah killed sheep and cattle and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he called all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he did not call.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, "Haven't you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord doesn't know it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Go in to king David, and tell him, 'Did you not, my lord, king, swear to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>Bathsheba went in to the king into the room. The king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>Bathsheba bowed, and showed respect to the king. The king said, "What would you like?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>She said to him, "My lord, you swore by the Lord your God to your handmaid, 'Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king, do not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>He has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army; but he hasn't called Solomon your servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>You, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>Behold, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>They told the king, saying, "Behold, Nathan the prophet!"When he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>Nathan said, "My lord, king, have you said, 'Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>For he is gone down this day, and has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest. Behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, 'Long live king Adonijah!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>But he hasn't called me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven't shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>Then king David answered, "Call to me Bathsheba." She came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>The king swore, and said, "As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>most certainly as I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying, 'Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place;' most certainly so will I do this day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and showed respect to the king, and said, "Let my lord king David live forever!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>King David said, "Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada." They came before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>The king said to them, "Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel. Blow the trumpet, and say, 'Long live king Solomon!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my place. I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, "Amen. May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, say so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>As the Lord has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet; and all the people said, "Long live king Solomon!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with their sound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, "Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, "Come in; for you are a worthy man, and bring good news."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>Jonathan answered Adonijah, "Most certainly our lord king David has made Solomon king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride on the king's mule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. They have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that you have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>Also, Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>Moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, 'May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne;' and the king bowed himself on the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>Also thus said the king, 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>All the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and each man went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>It was told Solomon, saying, "Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon; for, behold, he has laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>Solomon said, "If he shows himself a worthy man, not a hair of him shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. He came and bowed down to king Solomon; and Solomon said to him, "Go to your house."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>Now the days of David drew near that he should die; and he commanded Solomon his son, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>"I am going the way of all the earth. You be strong therefore, and show yourself a man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>and keep the instruction of the Lord your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, his commandments, his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do, and wherever you turn yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>That the Lord may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, 'If your children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you,' he said, 'a man on the throne of Israel.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>"Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his sash that was about his waist, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>Do therefore according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those who eat at your table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>"Behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, 'I will not put you to death with the sword.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man; and you will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>Solomon sat on the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was firmly established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. She said, "Do you come peaceably?"He said, "Peaceably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>He said moreover, I have something to tell you."She said, "Say on."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>He said, "You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign. However the kingdom is turned around, and has become my brother's; for it was his from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>Now I ask one petition of you. Do not deny me."She said to him, "Say on."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>He said, "Please speak to Solomon the king (for he will not tell you 'no'), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>Bathsheba said, "Alright. I will speak for you to the king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. The king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>Then she said, "I ask one small petition of you; do not deny me."The king said to her, "Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>She said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>King Solomon answered his mother, "Why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>Then king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, "God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>Now therefore as the Lord lives, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>King Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell on him, so that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>To Abiathar the priest the king said, "Go to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and because you were afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to the Lord, that he might fulfill the word of the Lord, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>The news came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he did not turn after Absalom. Joab fled to the Tent of the Lord, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>It was told king Solomon, "Joab has fled to the Tent of the Lord, and behold, he is by the altar." Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, "Go, fall on him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>Benaiah came to the Tent of the Lord, and said to him, "Thus says the king, 'Come forth!'"He said, "No; but I will die here."Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, "Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>The king said to him, "Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>The Lord will return his blood on his own head, because he fell on two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, and my father David did not know it: Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>So shall their blood return on the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed forever. But to David, and to his seed, and to his house, and to his throne, there shall be peace forever from the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.34'>Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him, and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.35'>The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army; and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.36'>The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and do not go out from there anywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.37'>For on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall surely die: your blood shall be on your own head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.38'>Shimei said to the king, "The saying is good. As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do." Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.39'>It happened at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. They told Shimei, saying, "Behold, your servants are in Gath."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.40'>Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.41'>It was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.42'>The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, "Did I not adjure you by the Lord, and warn you, saying, 'Know for certain, that on the day you go out, and walk abroad any where, you shall surely die?' You said to me, 'The saying that I have heard is good.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.43'>Why then have you not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment that I have instructed you with?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.44'>The king said moreover to Shimei, "You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to, that you did to David my father. Therefore the Lord shall return your wickedness on your own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.45'>But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.46'>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell on him, so that he died. The kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the Lord until those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.5'>In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, "Ask what I shall give you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.6'>Solomon said, "You have shown to your servant David my father great loving kindness, according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you. You have kept for him this great loving kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.7'>Now, Lord my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father. I am but a little child. I do not know how to go out or come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.8'>Your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen, a great people, that can't be numbered nor counted for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.9'>Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this your great people?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.10'>The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.11'>God said to him, "Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, neither have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.15'>Solomon awoke; and behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings, offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.16'>Then two women who were prostitutes came to the king, and stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.17'>The one woman said, "Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house. I delivered a child with her in the house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.20'>She arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.21'>When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I bore."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.22'>The other woman said, "No; but the living is my son, and the dead is your son."This said, "No; but the dead is your son, and the living is my son." Thus they spoke before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.23'>Then the king said, "The one says, 'This is my son who lives, and your son is the dead;' and the other says, 'No; but your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.24'>The king said, "Get me a sword." They brought a sword before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.25'>The king said, "Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.26'>Then the woman whose the living child was spoke to the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, "Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no way kill it!"But the other said, "It shall be neither mine nor yours. Divide it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.27'>Then the king answered, "Give her the living child, and in no way kill it. She is its mother."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.28'>All Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.5.1'>Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.5.2'>Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.5.3'>"You know how that David my father could not build a house for the name of the Lord his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.5.9'>My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea.

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.2'>The house which king Solomon built for the Lord, its length was sixty cubits, and its breadth twenty, and its height thirty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.3'>The porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was its length, according to the breadth of the house. Ten cubits was its breadth before the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.4'>For the house he made windows of fixed lattice work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.5'>Against the wall of the house he built stories all around, against the walls of the house all around, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side rooms all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.6'>The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.7'>The house, when it was in building, was built of stone prepared at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.8'>The door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story, and out of the middle into the third.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.9'>So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.10'>He built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.11'>The word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.12'>"Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.14'>So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.15'>He built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.16'>He built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling: he built them for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.17'>In front of the temple sanctuary was forty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.18'>There was cedar on the house within, carved with buds and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.19'>He prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.20'>Within the oracle was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in its height; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with cedar.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.23'>In the oracle he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.24'>Five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.26'>The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.27'>He set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.28'>He overlaid the cherubim with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.29'>He carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, inside and outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.30'>The floor of the house he overlaid with gold, inside and outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.31'>For the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive wood: the lintel and door posts were a fifth part of the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.32'>So he made two doors of olive wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.33'>So also made he for the entrance of the temple door posts of olive wood, out of a fourth part of the wall;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.35'>He carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.36'>He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.37'>In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the Lord laid, in the month Ziv.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.38'>In the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all its parts, and according to all its fashion. So was he seven years in building it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.1'>Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.2'>For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length was one hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.3'>It was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams, that were on the pillars; fifteen in a row.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.4'>There were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.5'>All the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.6'>He made the porch of pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.7'>He made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.8'>His house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter (whom Solomon had taken as wife), like this porch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.9'>All these were of costly stones, even of cut stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.10'>The foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.11'>Above were costly stones, even cut stone, according to measure, and cedar wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.12'>The great court around had three courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of the Lord, and the porch of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.13'>King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.14'>He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. He came to king Solomon, and performed all his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.15'>For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits encircled either of them about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.16'>He made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.17'>There were nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.18'>So he made the pillars; and there were two rows around on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars: and he did so for the other capital.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.19'>The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work, four cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.20'>There were capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows around on the other capital.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.21'>He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.22'>On the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.23'>He made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.24'>Under its brim around there were buds which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea: the buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.25'>It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.26'>It was a handbreadth thick: and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.27'>He made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.28'>The work of the bases was like this: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.29'>and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.30'>Every base had four bronze wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet of it had supports: beneath the basin were the supports molten, with wreaths at the side of each.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.31'>The mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and its mouth was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its mouth were engravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.32'>The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.33'>The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.34'>There were four supports at the four corners of each base: its supports were of the base itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.35'>In the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.36'>On the plates of its stays, and on its panels, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.37'>In this way, he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.38'>He made ten basins of brass: one basin contained forty baths; and every basin was four cubits; and on every one of the ten bases one basin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.39'>He set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.40'>Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.41'>the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.42'>and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.43'>and the ten bases, and the ten basins on the bases;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.44'>and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.45'>and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of the Lord, were of burnished brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.46'>The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.47'>Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.48'>Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the Lord: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the show bread was, of gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.49'>and the lampstands, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.50'>and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, of the temple, of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.51'>Thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house of the Lord was finished. Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.20'>Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was nothing like it made in any kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.21'>All king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.22'>For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.23'>So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.24'>All the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.25'>They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.26'>Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.27'>The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.28'>The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.29'>A chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, they brought them out by their means.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.11'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.1'>Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.2'>of the nations concerning which the Lord said to the children of Israel, "You shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods." Solomon joined to these in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.3'>He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.4'>For it happened, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.5'>For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.6'>Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and did not go fully after the Lord, as did David his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.7'>Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the mountain that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.23'>God raised up an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.24'>He gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop, when David killed them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and lived therein, and reigned in Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.25'>He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief of Hadad: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.26'>Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.27'>This was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.39'>I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not forever.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.40'>Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.5'>He said to them, "Depart for three days, then come back to me."The people departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.6'>King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, "What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.7'>They spoke to him, saying, "If you will be a servant to this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.8'>But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.9'>He said to them, "What counsel do you give, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, 'Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.10'>The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, "Thus you shall tell this people who spoke to you, saying, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter to us;' you shall say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.11'>Now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.12'>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, "Come to me again the third day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.13'>The king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.14'>and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.15'>So the king did not listen to the people; for it was a thing brought about of the Lord, that he might establish his word, which the Lord spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.16'>When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, "What portion have we in David? Neither do we have an inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David." So Israel departed to their tents.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.21'>When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.22'>But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.8'>He answered him, "It is I. Go, tell your lord, 'Behold, Elijah is here!'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.9'>He said, "Wherein have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.10'>As the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you. When they said, 'He is not here,' he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they did not find you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.11'>Now you say, 'Go, tell your lord, "Behold, Elijah is here."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.12'>It will happen, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of the Lord will carry you I do not know where; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he can't find you, he will kill me. But I, your servant, have feared the Lord from my youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.13'>Wasn't it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the Lord, how I hid one hundred men of the Lord's prophets with fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.14'>Now you say, 'Go, tell your lord, "Behold, Elijah is here";' and he will kill me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.15'>Elijah said, "As the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.16'>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.17'>It happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, "Is that you, you troubler of Israel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.18'>He answered, "I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your father's house, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and you have followed the Baals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.19'>Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel, and four hundred fifty of the prophets of Baal, and four hundred of the prophets of the Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.20'>So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to Mount Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.21'>Elijah came near to all the people, and said, "How long will you waver between the two sides? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him."The people answered him not a word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.22'>Then Elijah said to the people, "I, even I only, am left a prophet of the Lord; but Baal's prophets are four hundred fifty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.23'>Let them therefore give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bull, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.24'>You call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the Lord. The God who answers by fire, let him be God."All the people answered, "It is well said."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.25'>Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one bull for yourselves, and dress it first; for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.26'>They took the bull which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any who answered. They leaped about the altar which was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.27'>It happened at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, "Cry aloud; for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he has gone aside, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleeps and must be awakened."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.28'>They cried aloud, and cut themselves in their way with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.29'>It was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the offering; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any who regarded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.30'>Elijah said to all the people, "Come near to me"; and all the people came near to him. He repaired the altar of the Lord that was thrown down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.31'>Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord came, saying, "Israel shall be your name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.32'>With the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord. He made a trench around the altar, large enough to contain two measures of seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.33'>He put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, "Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.34'>He said, "Do it a second time"; and they did it the second time. He said, "Do it a third time"; and they did it the third time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.35'>The water ran around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.36'>It happened at the time of the offering of the offering, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, "Lord, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.37'>Hear me, Lord, hear me, that this people may know that you, Lord, are God, and that you have turned their heart back again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.38'>Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.39'>When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces. They said, "The Lord, he is God! The Lord, he is God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.40'>Elijah said to them, "Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let one of them escape!"They seized them. Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.41'>Elijah said to Ahab, "Get up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.42'>So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.43'>He said to his servant, "Go up now, look toward the sea."He went up, and looked, and said, "There is nothing."He said, "Go again" seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.44'>It happened at the seventh time, that he said, "Behold, a small cloud, like a man's hand, is rising out of the sea."He said, "Go up, tell Ahab, 'Get ready and go down, so that the rain doesn't stop you.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.45'>It happened in a little while, that the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.46'>The hand of the Lord was on Elijah; and he tucked his cloak into his belt and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.5'>But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, "Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.6'>He said to her, "Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, 'Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for it.' He answered, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'"</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.17'>The word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.18'>"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to take possession of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.19'>You shall speak to him, saying, 'Thus says the Lord, "Have you killed and also taken possession?"' You shall speak to him, saying, 'Thus says the Lord, "In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs will lick your blood, even yours."'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.20'>Ahab said to Elijah, "Have you found me, my enemy?"He answered, "I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.21'>Behold, I will bring disaster on you, and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab everyone, slave or free in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.22'>I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and have made Israel to sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.23'>The Lord also spoke of Jezebel, saying, "The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.24'>The dogs will eat he who dies of Ahab in the city; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.25'>But there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.26'>He did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.27'>It happened, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.28'>The word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.29'>"See how Ahab humbles himself before me? Because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the disaster in his days; but in his son's days will I bring the disaster on his house."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.22'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.1'>They continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.2'>It happened in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.3'>The king of Israel said to his servants, "You know that Ramoth Gilead is ours, and we are still, and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.4'>He said to Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth Gilead?"Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.5'>Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "Please inquire first for the word of the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.6'>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, "Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?"They said, "Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.7'>But Jehoshaphat said, "Isn't there here a prophet of the Lord, that we may inquire of him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.8'>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord, Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil."Jehoshaphat said, "Do not let the king say so."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.9'>Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, "Quickly get Micaiah the son of Imlah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.10'>Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.11'>Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, "Thus says the Lord, 'With these you shall push the Syrians, until they are consumed.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.12'>All the prophets prophesied so, saying, "Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.13'>The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, "See now, the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak good."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.14'>Micaiah said, "As the Lord lives, what the Lord says to me, that I will speak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.15'>When he had come to the king, the king said to him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?"He answered him, "Go up and prosper; and the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.16'>The king said to him, "How many times do I have to adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.17'>He said, "I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. The Lord said, 'These have no master. Let them each return to his house in peace.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.18'>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.19'>Micaiah said, "Therefore hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.20'>The Lord said, 'Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?' One said one thing; and another said another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.21'>A spirit came out and stood before the Lord, and said, 'I will entice him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.22'>The Lord said to him, 'How?' He said, 'I will go out and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' He said, 'You will entice him, and will also prevail. Go out and do so.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.23'>Now therefore, behold, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and the Lord has pronounced disaster against you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.24'>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, "Which way did the Spirit of the Lord go from me to speak to you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.25'>Micaiah said, "Behold, you will see on that day, when you go into an inner room to hide yourself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.26'>The king of Israel said, "Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.27'>Say, 'Thus says the king, "Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace."'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.28'>Micaiah said, "If you return at all in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me." He said, "Listen, all you people!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.29'>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.30'>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes." The king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.31'>Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.32'>It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, "Surely that is the king of Israel!" and they turned aside to fight against him. Jehoshaphat cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.33'>It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.34'>A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, "Turn your hand, and carry me out of the battle; for I am severely wounded."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.35'>The battle increased that day. The king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, and died at evening. The blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.36'>A cry went throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, "Every man to his city, and every man to his country!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.37'>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.38'>They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed themselves; according to the word of the Lord which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.39'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.40'>So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.41'>Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.43'>He walked in all the way of Asa his father; He did not turn aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord: however the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.44'>Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.45'>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.46'>The remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.47'>There was no king in Edom: a deputy was king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.48'>Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they did not go; for the ships were broken at Ezion Geber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.49'>Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my servants go with your servants in the ships." But Jehoshaphat would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.50'>Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; Jehoram his son reigned in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.51'>Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.52'>He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, in which he made Israel to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.53'>He served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger the Lord, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.</verse>
