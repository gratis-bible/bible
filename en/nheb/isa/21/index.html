As whirlwinds in the Negev sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from an awesome land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A grievous vision is declared to me. The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; attack! I have stopped all of Media's sighing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish. Pains have taken hold on me, like the pains of a woman in labor. I am in so much pain that I can't hear. I so am dismayed that I can't see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They prepare the table. They set the watch. They eat. They drink. Rise up, you princes, oil the shield!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the Lord said to me, "Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He cried like a lion: "Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and every night I stay at my post.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs." He answered, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!" That which I have heard from the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The burden of Dumah. One calls to me out of Seir, "Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The watchman said, "The morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire. Come back again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The burden on Arabia. In the forest in Arabia you will lodge, you caravans of Dedanites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They brought water to him who was thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the Lord said to me, "Within a year, as a worker bound by contract would count it, all the glory of Kedar will fail,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for the Lord, the God of Israel, has spoken it."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
