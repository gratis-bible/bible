      <chapter osisID='Gen.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>Now the earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. There was evening and there was morning, one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>God said, "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>God called the expanse sky. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together in one gathering, and let the dry land appear;" and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>God said, "Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed in it, on the earth;" and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>The earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>There was evening and there was morning, a third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth;" and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>God created the large sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;" and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'>God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'>God created man in his own image. In God's image he created him; male and female he created them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'>God blessed them. God said to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;" and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'>God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>The heavens and the earth were finished, and all their vast array.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>On the sixth day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work which he had created and made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>The Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>The Lord God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>Out of the ground the Lord God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became four heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>The name of the first is Pishon: this is the one which flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>and the gold of that land is good. There is aromatic resin and the onyx stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>The name of the second river is Gihon: the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>The name of the third river is Hiddekel: this is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>The Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>The Lord God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>The Lord God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>Out of the ground the Lord God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>The Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>He made the rib, which the Lord God had taken from the man, into a woman, and brought her to the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>The man said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'>They were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, "Has God really said, 'You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>The woman said to the serpent, "Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>The serpent said to the woman, "You won't surely die,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and ate; and she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>The eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>They heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>The Lord God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>The man said, "I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>God said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>The Lord God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?"The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>The Lord God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock, and above every animal of the field. On your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>To the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth. In pain you will bring forth children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>To Adam he said, "Because you have listened to your wife's voice, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground for your sake. In toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>Thorns also and thistles will it bring forth to you; and you will eat the herb of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>By the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For you are dust, and to dust you shall return."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>The man called his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>The Lord God made coats of skins for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>The Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he put forth his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever..."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>So he drove out the man; and he placed Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>The man knew Eve his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said, "I have gotten a man with the Lord's help."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>Again she gave birth, to Cain's brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>As time passed, it happened that Cain brought an offering to the Lord from the fruit of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. The Lord respected Abel and his offering,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>but he did not respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>The Lord said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>If you do well, will it not be lifted up? If you do not do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>Cain said to Abel, his brother, "Let's go into the field." It happened when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>The Lord said to Cain, "Where is Abel, your brother?"He said, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>The Lord said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>From now on, when you till the ground, it won't yield its strength to you. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>Cain said to the Lord, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>Behold, you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. It will happen that whoever finds me will kill me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>The Lord said to him, "Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold." the Lord appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should strike him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>Cain went out from the Lord's presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>To Enoch was born Irad. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>Lamech took two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>His brother's name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. Tubal Cain's sister was Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>Lamech said to his wives,"Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech,for I have slain a man for wounding me,a young man for bruising me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>If Cain will be avenged seven times,truly Lamech seventy-seven times."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, "for God has appointed me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>There was also born a son to Seth, and he named him Enosh. Then men began to call on the Lord's name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.1'>This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him in God's likeness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.2'>He created them male and female, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.19.3'>He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.4'>But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.5'>They called to Lot, and said to him, "Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.30.39'>The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.40'>Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and did not put them into Laban's flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.41'>It happened, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.42'>but when the flock were feeble, he did not put them in. So the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.43'>The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.31'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.1'>He heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, "Jacob has taken away all that was our father's. From that which was our father's, has he gotten all this wealth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.2'>Jacob saw the expression on Laban's face, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.3'>The Lord said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives, and I will be with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.4'>Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.5'>and said to them, "I see the expression on your father's face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.6'>You know that I have served your father with all of my strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.7'>Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God did not allow him to hurt me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.8'>If he said this, 'The speckled will be your wages,' then all the flock bore speckled. If he said this, 'The streaked will be your wages,' then all the flock bore streaked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.9'>Thus God has taken away your father's livestock, and given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.10'>It happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.11'>The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.12'>He said, 'Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.13'>I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.14'>Rachel and Leah answered him, "Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.15'>Aren't we accounted by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.16'>For all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.17'>Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.18'>and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.19'>Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.20'>Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he did not tell him that he was running away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.21'>So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.22'>Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.23'>He took his relatives with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.24'>God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said to him, "Take heed to yourself that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.25'>Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.26'>Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.27'>Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and did not tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.28'>and did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.29'>It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Take heed to yourself that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.30'>Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father's house, but why have you stolen my gods?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.31'>Jacob answered Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I said, 'Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.32'>Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it." For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.33'>Laban went into Jacob's tent, into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he did not find them. He went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.34'>Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel's saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt about all the tent, but did not find them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.35'>She said to her father, "Do not let my lord be angry that I can't rise up before you; for the manner of women is on me." He searched, but did not find the teraphim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.36'>Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, "What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.37'>Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.38'>These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven't eaten the rams of your flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.39'>That which was torn of animals, I did not bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.40'>This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.41'>These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.42'>Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.43'>Laban answered Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.44'>Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be for a witness between me and you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.45'>Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.46'>Jacob said to his relatives, "Gather stones." They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.47'>Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.48'>Laban said, "This heap is witness between me and you this day." Therefore it was named Galeed</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.49'>and Mizpah, for he said, "The Lord watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.50'>If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.51'>Laban said to Jacob, "See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.52'>May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.53'>The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.54'>Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.55'>Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.32.1'>Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.2'>When he saw them, Jacob said, "This is God's army." He called the name of that place Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.3'>Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.4'>He commanded them, saying, "This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: 'This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.5'>I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.6'>The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau. Not only that, but he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.7'>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.8'>and he said, "If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.9'>Jacob said, "God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord, who said to me, 'Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.10'>I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.11'>Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers with the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.12'>You said, 'I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which can't be numbered because there are so many.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.13'>He lodged there that night, and took from that which he had with him, a present for Esau, his brother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.14'>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.15'>thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.16'>He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.17'>He commanded the foremost, saying, "When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, 'Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.18'>Then you shall say, 'They are your servant, Jacob's. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.19'>He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, "This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.20'>You shall say, 'Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.'" For, he said, "I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.21'>So the present passed over before him, and he himself lodged that night in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.22'>He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.23'>He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.24'>Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.25'>When he saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.26'>The man said, "Let me go, for the day breaks."Jacob said, "I won't let you go, unless you bless me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.27'>He said to him, "What is your name?"He said, "Jacob."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.28'>He said, "Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.29'>Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name."He said, "Why is it that you ask what my name is?" He blessed him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.30'>Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, he said, "I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.31'>The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.32'>Therefore the children of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.33'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.1'>Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two handmaids.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.2'>He put the handmaids and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.3'>He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.33.5'>He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, "Who are these with you?"He said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.6'>Then the handmaids came near with their children, and they bowed themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.7'>Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.8'>Esau said, "What do you mean by all this company which I met?"Jacob said, "To find favor in the sight of my lord."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.33.10'>Jacob said, "Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.11'>Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough." He urged him, and he took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.12'>Esau said, "Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.13'>Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.14'>Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.15'>Esau said, "Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me."He said, "Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.16'>So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.17'>Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.18'>Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.19'>He bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for one hundred pieces of money.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.35.1'>God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.2'>Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, "Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.3'>Let us arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.4'>They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.5'>They traveled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.6'>So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.7'>He built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.35.12'>The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your seed after you will I give the land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.13'>God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.14'>Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.35.16'>They traveled from Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed. She had hard labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.17'>When she was in hard labor, the midwife said to her, "Do not be afraid, for now you will have another son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.18'>It happened, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she named him Benoni, but his father named him Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.19'>Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.20'>Jacob set up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.21'>Israel traveled, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.22'>It happened, while Israel lived in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard of it.Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.23'>The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.24'>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.25'>The sons of Bilhah (Rachel's handmaid): Dan and Naphtali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.26'>The sons of Zilpah (Leah's handmaid): Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.27'>Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac lived as foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.28'>The days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.29'>Isaac gave up the spirit, and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.37'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.1'>Jacob lived in the land of his father's travels, in the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.2'>This is the history of the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.3'>Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a coat of many colors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.4'>His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and couldn't speak peaceably to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.5'>Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.6'>He said to them, "Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.7'>for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to my sheaf."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.8'>His brothers said to him, "Will you indeed reign over us? Or will you indeed have dominion over us?" They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.9'>He dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, "Behold, I have dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.10'>He told it to his father and to his brothers. His father rebuked him, and said to him, "What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.11'>His brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.12'>His brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.13'>Israel said to Joseph, "Aren't your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them." He said to him, "Here I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.14'>He said to him, "Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flock; and bring me word again." So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.15'>A certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. The man asked him, "What are you looking for?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.16'>He said, "I am looking for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the flock."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.17'>The man said, "They have left here, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'"Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.18'>They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.19'>They said one to another, "Behold, this dreamer comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.20'>Come now therefore, and let's kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, 'An evil animal has devoured him.' We will see what will become of his dreams."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.21'>Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, "Let's not take his life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.22'>Reuben said to them, "Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him"-that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.23'>It happened, when Joseph came to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.24'>and they took him, and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.25'>They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.26'>Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.27'>Come, and let's sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh." His brothers listened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.28'>Midianites who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. They brought Joseph into Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.29'>Reuben returned to the pit; and saw that Joseph wasn't in the pit; and he tore his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.30'>He returned to his brothers, and said, "The child is no more; and I, where will I go?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.31'>They took Joseph's coat, and killed a male goat, and dipped the coat in the blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.32'>They took the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, "We have found this. Examine it, now, whether it is your son's coat or not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.33'>He recognized it, and said, "It is my son's coat. An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.34'>Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.35'>All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said, "For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning." His father wept for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.36'>The Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.38'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.1'>It happened at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.2'>Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. He took her, and went in to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.3'>She conceived, and bore a son; and he named him Er.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.4'>She conceived again, and bore a son; and she named him Onan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.5'>She yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.6'>Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.7'>Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord. The Lord killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.8'>Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her, and raise up seed to your brother."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.9'>Onan knew that the seed wouldn't be his; and it happened, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.10'>The thing which he did was evil in the sight of the Lord, and he killed him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.11'>Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow in your father's house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up;" for he said, "Lest he also die, like his brothers." Tamar went and lived in her father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.12'>After many days, Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.13'>It was told Tamar, saying, "Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.14'>She took off of her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn't given to him as a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.15'>When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.16'>He turned to her by the way, and said, "Please come, let me come in to you," for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.She said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.17'>He said, "I will send you a kid of the goats from the flock."She said, "Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.18'>He said, "What pledge will I give you?"She said, "Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand."He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.19'>She arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.20'>Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, but he did not find her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.21'>Then he asked the men of her place, saying, "Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?"They said, "There has been no prostitute here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.22'>He returned to Judah, and said, "I haven't found her; and also the men of the place said, 'There has been no prostitute here.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.23'>Judah said, "Let her keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this kid, and you haven't found her."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.24'>It happened about three months later, that it was told Judah, saying, "Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute; and moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution."Judah said, "Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.25'>When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, "By the man, whose these are, I am with child." She also said, "Please discern whose are these-the signet, and the cords, and the staff."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.26'>Judah acknowledged them, and said, "She is more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shelah, my son."He knew her again no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.27'>It happened in the time of her travail, that behold, twins were in her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.28'>When she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, "This came out first."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.29'>It happened, as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out, and she said, "Why have you made a breach for yourself?" Therefore his name was called Perez.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.39.4'>Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.5'>It happened from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the Lord was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.39.10'>As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he did not listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.11'>About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.39.14'>she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, "Behold, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.39.19'>It happened, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, "This is what your servant did to me," that his wrath was kindled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.20'>Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.21'>But the Lord was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.22'>The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.41.32'>The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.33'>"Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.47.22'>Only he did not buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.23'>Then Joseph said to the people, "Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.24'>It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food for your little ones."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.25'>They said, "You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.26'>Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.27'>Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.28'>Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.29'>The time drew near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, "If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please do not bury me in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.30'>but when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place."He said, "I will do as you have said."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.31'>He said, "Swear to me," and he swore to him. Israel bowed himself on the bed's head.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.48'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.1'>It happened after these things, that someone said to Joseph, "Behold, your father is sick." He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.2'>Someone told Jacob, and said, "Behold, your son Joseph comes to you," and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.3'>Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.4'>and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.5'>Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.6'>Your issue, whom you become the father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.7'>As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem)."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.8'>Israel saw Joseph's sons, and said, "Who are these?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.9'>Joseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here."He said, "Please bring them to me, and I will bless them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.10'>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn't see. He brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.11'>Israel said to Joseph, "I did not think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your seed also."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.12'>Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.13'>Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.14'>Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.15'>He blessed Joseph, and said, "The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.16'>the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. Let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.17'>When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.18'>Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.19'>His father refused, and said, "I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a multitude of nations."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.20'>He blessed them that day, saying, "In you will Israel bless, saying, 'God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh'" He set Ephraim before Manasseh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.21'>Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.22'>Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.49'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.1'>Jacob called to his sons, and said: "Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come.</verse>
