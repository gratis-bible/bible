        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>And Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Thamar, and Pharez begat Esrom, and Esrom begat Aram;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>And Aram begat Aminadab, and Aminadab begat Naasson, and Naasson begat Salmon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>And Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>And Jesse begat David the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>And David the king begat Solomon, of the wife of Uriah; And Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>And Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Jehoram, and Jehoram begat Uzziah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>And Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>And Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amon, and Amon begat Josiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>And Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begat Salathiel, and Salathiel begat Zerubbabel; And Zerubbabel begat Abiud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>And Azor begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>And Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations: and from David to the Babylonish captivity are fourteen generations, and from the Babylonish captivity to Christ are fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Christ was on this wise: His mother Mary, being espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and yet not willing to make her a publick example, purposed to put her away privily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But while he was thinking on these things, behold an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife; for that which is begotten in her, is of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>(Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>saying, Behold the virgin shall be with child, and bring forth a Son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>But he knew her not, till she had brought forth her Son, the first-born. And he called his name Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold wise men came from the East to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>For we have seen his star in the East, and are come to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And having assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he demanded of them, Where the Christ was to be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea; for thus it is written by the prophet, And thou,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>Bethlehem in the land of Judah, art in no wise the least among the princes of Judah; for out of thee shall come forth a Ruler, who shall feed my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod, having privately called the wise men, inquired of them with great exactness, at what time the star appeared:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go, inquire exactly concerning the young child, and if ye find him, bring me word again, that I also may come and worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>And having heard the king, they departed; and lo the star which they had seen in the East, moved on before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>And seeing the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And being come into the house, they saw the young child, with Mary his mother; and falling down, they worshiped him. And opening their treasures, they presented to him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being warned of God in a dream, not to return to Herod, they went back into their own country another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>And when they were gone back, behold an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and continue there till I shall tell thee; for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>And he arose, and took the young child and his mother by night, and retired into Egypt, And continued there till the death of Herod;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, seeing that he was deluded by the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sending forth, slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the confines thereof, from two years old and under; according to the time which he had exactly inquired of the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>saying, In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But when Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought the young child's life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And he arose and took the young child and his mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>and came into the land of Israel, But having heard, Archelaus reigneth over Judea, in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither, and being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the region of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days cometh John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>And saying, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>And this John had his raiment of camels hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their Sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Ye serpents, ye brood of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>And say not within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father; for I say to you, God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>But even the axe already lieth at the root of the trees; therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I; whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather the wheat into the garner, but will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And Jesus being baptized, went up straightway from the water, and lo the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And lo a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then was Jesus led up by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And having fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterwards hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And the tempter coming to him said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answering said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil taketh him with him into the holy city, and setteth him on the battlement of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>And saith to him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it is written, He shall charge his angels concerning thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again the devil taketh him with him to an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, And saith to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus saith to him, Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil leaveth him, and behold angels came and waited upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>But when Jesus heard, that John was cast into prison, he retired into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt at Capernaum, which is on the sea coast, in the borders of Zebulon and Naphthali: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>saying, The land of Zebulon and the land of Naphthali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>by the way of the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, The people who walked in darkness, saw a great light, and to them who sat in the region of the shadow of death, light is sprung up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he saith to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And straitway leaving the nets they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And going on from thence, he saw two other brethren, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in a vessel with Zebedee their father mending their nets; and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>And leaving the vessel and their father, they immediately followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease, and all manner of malady among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And his fame went thro' all Syria; and they brought to him all sick people, that were seized with divers diseases and tormenting pains; even demoniacs, and lunaticks, and paralytics; and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And there followed him great multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis, and Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain; and when he was set down his disciples came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>And he opened his mouth and taught them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>saying, Happy are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Happy are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Happy are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Happy are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Happy are the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Happy are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Happy are the peace-makers; for they shall be called the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Happy are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Happy are ye when men shall revile and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>Ye are the light of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>A city that is situated on a mountain cannot be hid. Neither do they light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy but to fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For verily I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all things be effected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments and teach men so, shall be the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whosoever shall do and each them, he shall be great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say to you, That unless your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>Ye have heard, that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt do no murder, and whosoever doth murder, shall be liable to the judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be liable to the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the council; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be liable to hell-fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remember, that thy brother hath ought against thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>Leaving thy gift there before the altar, go; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him, lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt in no wise come out thence, till thou hast paid the last farthing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>Ye have heard, that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>But if thy right eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if thy right-hand cause thee to offend, cut it off and cast it from thee; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of Divorce.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say unto you, whosoever shall put away his wife, save for the cause of whoredom, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away, committeth adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Again, ye have heard, that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform thine oaths unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I say unto you, Swear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head; for thou canst not make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your conversation be yea, yea; nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these, cometh of the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say unto you, that ye resist not the evil man: but whosoever shall smite thee on the right-cheek, turn to him the other also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And if a man will sue thee and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And whosoever shall compel thee to go with him one mile, go with him twain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to him that asketh thee, and him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>Ye have heard, that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>That ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>Do not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? Do not even the heathens so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>Therefore ye shall be perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.6'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>Take heed that ye practise not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>Therefore when thou dost alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But when thou dost alms, let not thy left-hand know what thy right-hand doth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>That thy alms may be in secret, and thy father who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>And when thou prayest, thou shall not be as the hypocrites; for they love to pray, standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may appear to men: verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.31'>But his fellow-servants, seeing what was done, were very sorry, and came and gave their lord an exact account of the whole matter.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.10'>So those servants going out into the highways, gathered together all whomsoever they found, both bad and good. And the feast was abundantly supplied with guests.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.14'>For many are called, but few chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.15'>Then went the Pharisees and consulted, how to insnare him in his talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.16'>And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth; neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.17'>Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.23'>The same day came the Saducees, who say there is no resurrection, and they asked him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>At last came two false witnesses, And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And the high priest rising up said to him, Answerest thou nothing? What do these witness against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answering said to him, I adjure thee by the living God, to tell us, if thou art the Christ, the Son of God?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then did they spit in his face and buffet him, and others smote him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God: let him deliver him now if he will have him; for he said, I am the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>And even the robbers that were crucified with him, cast the same reproach upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the earth, unto the ninth hour.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>what have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy one of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace and come out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And the unclean spirit having torn him, and cried with a loud noise, came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? What new teaching is this? For with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits and they obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And immediately his fame went forth into all the country of Galilee round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And coming out of the synagogue, they entered forthwith into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>And Simon's wife's mother lay ill of a fever, and immediately they tell him of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And he came and taking her by the hand, lifted her up; and straightway the fever left her, and she waited on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>And in the evening, when the sun was set, they brought to him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And the whole city was gathered together at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And he healed many that were ill of divers diseases, and cast out many devils, and suffered not the devils to say that they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And in the morning, rising a great while before day, he went out and departed into a desert place and prayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>And having found him, they say to him, All men seek thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And he saith to them, Let us go to the neighbouring towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore am I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And there came to him a leper beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying to him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And Jesus, moved with tender compassion, putting forth his hand, touched him, and saith to him, I will; be thou clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And having straitly charged him, he forthwith sent him away, And saith to him, See thou say nothing to any man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he going out published it much and blazed abroad the matter, so that he could no more openly enter into the city; but he was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was heard that he was in the house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his teaching, Hearken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>Behold, a sower went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And as he sowed, some fell by the way-side, and the birds of the air came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprung up, because it had no depth of earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>But when the sun was up, it was scorched, and because it had no root, it withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>And other fell on good ground, and yielded fruit springing up and increasing, and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he was alone, they that were about him, with the twelve, asked him of the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And he said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all things are in parables:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower soweth the word. And these are they by the way-side, where the word is sown;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these are they likewise who have received the seed on stony ground, who when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy: But have not root in themselves, and so indure but for a time:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth because of the word, they are presently offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And these are they that have received it among thorns,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>who hear the word, And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And these are they that have received it on the good ground, who hear the word and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirty fold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he said to them, Is a candle brought to be cut under a bushel or under a bed, and not to be set on a candlestick?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested, neither was any thing kept secret, but that it might come abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear. With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you, and to you that hear, shall more be given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For he that hath, to him shall be given; but he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>For the earth bringeth forth fruit of itself, first the blade, then the ear, after that, the full corn in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And he said, Whereto shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what comparison shall we compare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which when it is sown in the earth, is one of the least of the seeds that are in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>But when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs, so that the birds of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>And with many such parables spake he the word to them, as they were able to hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>But without a parable spake he not to them: and in private he expounded all things to his disciples.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth a tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And coming in, he saith to them, Why make ye this ado and weep? The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they laughed him to scorn. But having put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and goeth in where the damsel was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>And taking the damsel by the hand he said to her, Talitha cumi, which is, being interpreted, Damsel, (I say to thee) arise.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter? The son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses, and of Judas and Simon! And are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kindred, and in his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>And he could do no miracle there, save that he laid his hands on a few sick and healed them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And he calleth to him the twelve, and sent them forth by two and two, and gave them power over unclean spirits;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>But be shod with sandals, and not to put on two coats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>And he said to them, Wheresoever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>And whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you, departing thence shake off the dust under your feet, for a testimony against them. Verily I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herod himself had sent and apprehended John, and bound him in prison, for Herodias sake, his brother Philip's wife, for he had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for thee, to have thy brother's wife.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>And when the day was now far spent, the disciples coming to him said, This is a desert place, and it is now late.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>Send them away, that they may go into the country and villages round about, and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>And having sent them away, he went to a mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>And in the evening, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary to them. And about the fourth watch of the night he cometh to them, walking on the sea, and would have passed by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>But they seeing him walking on the sea, supposed it had been an apparition, and cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>(For they all saw him and were troubled.) And immediately he talked with them, and saith to them, Take courage: it is I: be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>And he went up to them into the boat, and the wind ceased: and they were amazed in themselves above measure and wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>For they considered not the miracle of the loaves; for their heart was hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret, and drew to shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>And when they were come out of the boat, they knew him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And wheresoever he entered into villages, cities, or country-places, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the hem of his garment; and as many as touched him were made whole.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>What is it which these witness against thee? But he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him and said to him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to deserve death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, Prophesy, And the officers smote him with the palms of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>And as Peter was in the hall below, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>And seeing Peter warming himself, she looked on him and said, Thou wast also with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou meanest. And he went out into the porch, and the cock crew.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>And he denied it again. And a little after, those that stood by, said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them; for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>Then he began to curse and to swear, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus had said to him, Before the cock crow twice, thou wilt deny me thrice. And he covered his head and wept.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>And when the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Salome, had bought spices, that they might come and embalm him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they come to the sepulchre, at the rising of the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they said one to another, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>(For it was very great:) And looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man, sitting on the right-side, clothed in a white robe; and they were affrighted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>He saith to them, Be not affrighted: ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen: he is not here. Behold the place where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, tell his disciples, and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>And going out, they fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: and they said nothing to any; for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Now when Jesus was risen early, the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>But they, hearing that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they were walking, going into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>And they went and told it to the rest, neither believed they them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Afterwards he appeared to the eleven, sitting at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them who had seen him after he was risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And he said to them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be damned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And these signs shall follow them that believe: in my name they shall cast out devils:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>they shall speak with new tongues: They shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them: they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>So then the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat on the right-hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Forasmuch as many have undertaken to compose a narrative of the facts which have been fully confirmed among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>Even as they who were eye-witnesses and ministers of the word from the beginning, delivered them to us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>It seemed good to me also, having accurately traced all things from their first rise, to write unto thee in order, most noble Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>That thou mayst know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>And they had no child, because Elisabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>And while he executed the priest's office before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>in the order of his course, According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn the incense, going into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And the whole multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And Zacharias seeing him was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And thou shalt have joy and exultation, and many shall rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he shall be great before the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said to the angel, Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answering, said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speak to thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And behold, thou shalt be deaf, and not able to speak, till the day that these things are done, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>And coming out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived, that he had seen a vision; for he beckoned to them, and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And when the days of his ministration were accomplished, he went to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>And after these days, his wife Elisabeth conceived,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>and hid herself five months, saying, Thus hath the Lord done to me, in the days wherein he looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God, to a city of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>named Nazareth, To a virgin of the house of David, espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, and the virgin's name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And the angel coming in to her, said, Hail, thou highly favoured; the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>But she seeing him, was troubled at his saying, and reasoned, what manner of salutation this should be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give him the throne of his father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob; for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answering said to her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born, shall be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And behold thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For with God, nothing shall be impossible. And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it unto me according to thy word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>And Mary arose in those days, and went with haste into the hill-country, into a city of Judah ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb: and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>And cried with a loud voice and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For lo! when the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And happy is she that believed; for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>My soul doth magnify the Lord, And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For he that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And his mercy is on them that fear him, from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He hath wrought strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He hath put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted them of low degree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He hath filled the hungry with good things, but sent the rich empty away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He hath helped his servant Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>in remembrance of his mercy, As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now Elisabeth's full time came, that she should be delivered, and she brought forth a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbours and relations heard, that the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>But his mother answering said, Nay, but he shall be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said to her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came on all that dwelt round about them, and all these things were noised abroad, in all the hill-country of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all that heard them, laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>for he hath visited and redeemed his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us, in the house of his servant David:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began: That we should be saved from our enemies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>and from the hand of all that hate us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>That he would grant us, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>to serve him without fear, In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And thou, child, shalt be a prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>To give knowledge of salvation to his people, by the remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Thro' the tender mercy of our God, whereby the Day-spring from on high hath visited us,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts, till the day of his being shewn to Israel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>And in those days there went out a decree from Augustus Cesar, that all the world should be inrolled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>(Now this first inrolment was made, when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And all went to be inrolled, every one to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>(because he was of the family and houshold of David) To be inrolled with Mary, his espoused wife, being great with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And while they were there, the days were fulfilled, that she should be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she brought forth her son, the first-born, and swathed him, and laid him in the manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And there were in the same country shepherds, lying out in the field, and keeping watch over their flock by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And lo an angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the angel said to them, Fear not; for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>and on earth peace; goodwill toward men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And when the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us go to Bethlehem, and see this thing which is done, which the Lord hath made known to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And having seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>And going into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he desired him to thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the multitude out of the boat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.49'>But he that heareth, and doth not, is like a man that built an house without a foundation upon the earth: against which the stream broke vehemently, and immediately it fell: and the breach of that house was great.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.7'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>Now when he had ended all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>And hearing of Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, beseeching him to come and heal his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And coming to Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy for whom thou shouldest do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>For he loveth our nation, and hath himself built us a synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee; but speak in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I am a man set under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Come, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>Jesus hearing these things, marvelled at him, and turning, said to the people that followed him, I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And they that had been sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>And he went afterward to a city called Nain, and many of his disciples went with him and a great multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>And as he drew nigh the gate of the city, behold a dead man was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a great multitude of the city was with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>And the Lord seeing her, was moved with tender compassion for her, and said, Weep not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>And he came and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, Arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>And the dead man sat up, and began to speak: and he delivered him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>And fear seized all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is risen up among us; and, God hath visited his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this rumour of him went forth through all Judea, and all the country round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>And the disciples of John informed him of all these things. And John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>calling to him two of his disciples, sent to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come, or look we for another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>And the men being come to him, said, John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he that should come, or look we for another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>And in that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues, and of evil spirits, and to many that were blind he gave sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>And he answering said to them, Go and tell John the things ye have seen and heard: the blind see; the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed; the deaf hear; the dead are raised; to the poor the gospel is preached.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And happy is he, whosoever shall not be offended at me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>And when the messengers of John were departed, he said to the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>A reed shaken by the wind? But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold they that are splendidly apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>This is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>For I say to you, among those that are born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he that is least in the kingdom of God, is greater than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>But the Pharisees and scribes made void the counsel of God, toward themselves, being not baptized of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>To whom then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of man is come, eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>But wisdom is justified by all her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>And one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him. And going into the Pharisee's house, he sat down to table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And behold a woman in the city, who had been a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at table in the Pharisee's house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>brought an alabaster box of ointment, And standing at his feet behind him weeping, watered his feet with a shower of tears, and wiped them, with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>But the Pharisee who had invited him, seeing it, spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known, who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>A certain creditor had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>But they having nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both: Which therefore will love him most?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>Simon answering said, I suppose, he to whom he forgave most. He said to him, Thou hast rightly judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>And turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath watered my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>Thou gavest me no kiss; but she, from the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>Thou didst not anoint my head with oil: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>Wherefore I say to thee, Those many sins of her's are forgiven; therefore she loved much: but he to whom little is forgiven, loveth little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven. And they that sat at table with him said within themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee: go in peace.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>And afterward he went through every city and village preaching and publishing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had gone seven devils,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>And Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to him of their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And much people being gathered together, coming to him out of every city, he spake by a parable, A sower went forth to sow his seed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>and while he sowed, some fell by the way-side; and it was trodden down, and the birds of the air devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>And some fell upon a rock, and springing up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundred fold. And saying these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And his disciples asked him, What is this parable?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to others in parables, so that seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>Those by the way-side are they that hear; then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>Those on the rock are they, who, when they hear, receive the word with joy. But they have no root, who for a while believe; but in time of temptation fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>That which fell among thorns are they, who, having heard, go forth, and are choked with cares, and riches, and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But that on the good ground are they, who, having heard the word, keep it in an honest and good heart, and bring forth fruit with perseverance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>No man having lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For there is nothing hid that shall not be discovered, neither any thing concealed, that shall not be known and come to light.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>And he answering said to them, My mother and my brethren are these who hear the word of God and keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>And on a certain day he went into a vessel with his disciples: and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they put to sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>And as they sailed, he fell asleep. And there came down a storm of wind on the lake, and they were filled with water, and were in danger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>And they came and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish! And he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>And he said to them, Where is your faith? But they were afraid and wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this? For he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>And they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is over-against Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>And as he went forth to land, there met him out of the city, a certain man that had had devils a long time, and wore no clothes, neither abode in an house, but in the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>But seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, What hast thou to do with me, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I beseech thee, torment me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man: for many times it had caught him, and he had been kept bound with chains and fetters, and breaking the bands asunder, he had been driven by the spirit into the deserts.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; because many devils had entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they besought him, that he would not command them to go into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>And there was an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him, that he would suffer them to enter into them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>And they that fed them, seeing what was done, fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>Then they went out to see what was done, and came to Jesus, and found the man out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>They also that had seen it told them, How he that was possessed by the devils was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about, besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear, and he went in the vessel and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>And the man out of whom the devils were departed, besought him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying, Return home,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>And when Jesus returned, the people gladly received him; for they were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And behold there came a man named Jairus, and he was ruler of the synagogue; and falling down at the feet of Jesus, he besought him to come to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>For he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as he went, the people thronged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>And a woman who had had an issue of blood twelve years, and had spent all her living upon Physicians, neither could be healed by any,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>And the woman, seeing that she was not hid, came trembling, and falling down before him, declared to him before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, and how she had been healed immediately.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>And hearing it they said, God forbid. And he looked on them and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, this is become the head of the corner?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>And they asked him, saying, Master, we know, that thou speakest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou persons, but teachest the way of God in truth:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this person hath done nothing amiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me, when thou comest in thy kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus said to him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>And it was about the sixth hour; and there was darkness over all the earth till the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And Jesus crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And having said thus, he expired.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And all his acquaintance, and the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And behold there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor, a good man and a just:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(He had not consented to the counsel and deed of them) of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself waited for the kingdom of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man going to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And taking it down, he wrapped it in fine linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women who had come with him from Galilee, following after, beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>And returning they prepared spices and ointments, and rested the sabbath, according to the commandment.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices, which they had prepared and certain others with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre, And entering, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>And while they were perplexed concerning it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>behold two men stood by them in shining garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their face to the earth, they said to them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spake to you being yet in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and rise again the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered his words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>And returning from the sepulchre, told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them, who told these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Peter rising, ran to the sepulchre; and stooping down, he seeth the linen clothes laid by themselves; and he went home, wondring at what was come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And behold two of them were going the same day to a village called Emmaus, which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him, Dost thou alone even sojourn at Jerusalem, and hast not known the things, which are come to pass there in these days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, Those concerning Jesus of Nazareth (who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>) How our chief priests and rulers delivered him to be condemned to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>and have crucified him, But we trusted that it had been he who should have redeemed Israel. And beside all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>Yea, and certain women of our company astonished us, who were early at the sepulchre,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>And not finding his body, they came, saying, That they had seen also a vision of angels, who say, he is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And some of the men who were with us, went to the sepulchre, and found it so as the women had said; but him they saw not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Then he said to them, O foolish, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them the things in all the scriptures, concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they drew nigh the village whither they were going, and he made as tho' he would go farther.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day declines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And he went in, to abide with them. And as he sat at table with them, he took the bread, and blessed it, and brake and gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he was talking to us in the way, and opening the scriptures to us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven met together, and them that were with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they told the things done in the way, and how he was known by them in the breaking of the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>And as they spake thus, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith to them, Peace be unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But being terrified and affrighted, they thought they saw a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why do reasonings arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And having spoken this, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have ye here any meat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>And he took it, and ate before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said to them, These are the words which I spake to you, being yet with you, that all things written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms concerning me, must be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then opened he their understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>to understand the scriptures, And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>And ye are witnesses of these things. And behold I send the promise of my Father upon you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>but tarry in the city Jerusalem, till ye be clothed with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he led them out as far as Bethany; and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And while he was blessing them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning existed the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>The same was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things were made by him, and without him was not one single thing made that was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shineth in darkness, but the darkness perceived it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a testimony,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>to testify of the light, that all thro' it might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not the light, but was sent to testify of the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>This was the true light, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world was made by him; yet the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own, and his own received him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But as many as received him, to them gave he privilege to become the sons of God, to them that believe in his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>Who were born, not of blood, nor by the will of the flesh, nor by the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word was made flesh, and tabernacled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John testified of him and cried, saying, This is he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is preferred before me, for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>And out of his fulness have we all received, even grace upon grace. For the law was given by Moses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>but grace and truth was by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, Who art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he confessed and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, What then, Art thou Elijah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. Then said they to him, Who art thou? That we may give an answer to them that sent us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>What sayest thou of thyself? He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>And they who were sent were of the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him and said to him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but there standeth one among you whom ye know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>He it is, who coming after me, is preferred before me, whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things were done in Bethabara, beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day he seeth Jesus coming toward him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is preferred before me; for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And I knew him not, but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John testified, saying, I saw the Spirit descending like a dove, and it abode upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I knew him not, but he that sent me to baptize with water, he had said to me, On whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, this is he who baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I saw it, and testified, that this is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Again, the next day, John was standing, and two of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>And looking upon Jesus walking, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. And Jesus turning and seeing them following,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>saith to them, What seek ye? They said to him, Rabbi, (that is, being interpreted, Master) where dwellest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He saith to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day; for it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John speak and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted the Christ.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>And he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus looking upon him, said, Thou art Simon, the son of Jonah; thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The day following he was minded to depart into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip findeth Nathanael and saith to him, We have found him, whom Moses in the law and the prophets described, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael saith to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith to him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael saith to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathagael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>Verily, verily I say to you, Hereafter ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And the third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And wine falling short, the mother of Jesus saith to him, They have not wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus saith to her, Woman, what is it to me and thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>Mine hour is not yet come. His mother saith to the servants, Whatsoever he saith to you, do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>And there were set there six water-pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three measures apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus saith to them, Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And he saith to them, Draw out now, and carry to the governor of the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>And they carried it. When the governor of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine (he knew not whence it was, but the servants, who had drawn the water knew) the governor of the feast calleth the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>And saith to him, Every man doth set out good wine first, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine till now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>Jesus wrought this beginning of miracles in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they tarried there not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>For the passover of the Jews was nigh, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, And found in the temple them that fold oxen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>and sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And having made a scourge of rushes, he drove all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers money,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>and otherthrew the tables, And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of traffick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>And his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign shewest thou us, seeing thou dost these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up in three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he spake of the temple of his body. When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, on the feast day, many believed in his name, beholding the miracles which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not trust himself to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>because he knew all men, And needed not that any should testify of man; for he knew what was in man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>The same came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know, that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles which thou dost, except God be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus saith to him, How can a man be born, when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him, may not perish, but have everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God sent not his Son into the world, to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved thro' him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He that believeth on him, is not condemned; but he that believeth not, is condemned already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For every one that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he that practiseth the truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea, and there he tarried with them and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>And John also was baptizing in Enon, near Salim, because there was much water there; and they came and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Then there arose a dispute between some of John's disciples and the Jews, about purifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony, behold he baptizeth, and all men come to him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am not the Christ, but I am sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly, because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>When therefore the Lord knew, that the Pharisees had heard, Jesus maketh and baptizeth more disciples than John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(Tho' Jesus himself batized not;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And he abode there two days. And many more believed,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>After the two days, he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>(Now Jesus himself had testified, That a prophet hath not honour in his own country.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast. For they also had come to the feast.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is in Jerusalem, by the sheep-gate, a bath, which is called in the Hebrew tongue, Bethesda, having five porticos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a great multitude of diseased, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>For an angel went down at certain times into the bath, and the water was troubled: and whosoever went in first, after the troubling of the water, was made whole, whatsoever disease he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>And a certain man was there, who had been diseased eight and thirty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>Jesus seeing him lie, and knowing that he had now been diseased a long time, saith to him, Desirest thou to be made whole?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The infirm man answered him, Sir, I have no man to put me into the bath, when the water is troubled; and while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus saith to him, Rise, take up thy bed and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked: and the same day was the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>Then said the Jews to him that was healed, It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to take up the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered, He that made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>Then asked they him, Who is the man that said to thee, Take up thy bed and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>And he that was healed knew not who he was; for Jesus had retired, a multitude being in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, Lo, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man departed and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he had done these things on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, My father worketh until now, and I work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath, but also said, that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Then answered Jesus and said to them, Verily, verily I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do; but what things soever he doth, these also doth the Son likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doth: and he will shew him greater works than these, so that ye will marvel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For neither doth the Father judge any one, but hath given all judgment to the Son:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>That all men may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father that sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Verily, verily I say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and cometh not into condemnation, but is passed from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Verily, verily I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son also to have life in himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>And hath given him authority, to execute judgment likewise, because he is the Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Marvel not at this: for the time is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>And shall come forth, they that have done good, to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I can do nothing of myself: as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just: because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I testify of myself, my testimony is not valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is another that testifieth of me, and I know that the testimony which he testifieth of me is valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>Ye sent to John, and he bare testimony to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But I receive not testimony from man; but these things I say, that ye may be saved.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have a greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to fulfil, the very works which I do, testify of me, that the Father hath sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father who hath sent me, he hath testified of me: ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>But Jesus went up into a mountain, and sat there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Jesus then lifting up his eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming to him, saith to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now the Jews feast of tabernacles was nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>His brethren therefore said to him, Depart hence and go into Judea, that thy disciples there also may see the works which thou dost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For no man doth any thing in secret, but desireth to be publickly known: if thou dost these things, shew thyself to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>(For neither did his brethren believe on him.) Jesus saith to them, My time is not yet come: your time is always ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>because I testify of it, that its works are evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him: for some said, He is a good man; others said, Nay; but he seduceth the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>However, no man spake openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>Now at the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How doth this man know letters, having never learned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If any man be willing to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory; but he that seekth the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Did not Moses give you the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>Yet none of you keepeth the law. Why seek ye to kill me? The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil. Who seeketh to kill thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and ye all marvel at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Moses gave you circumcision, (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers) and ye circumcise a man on the sabbath.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>Ye shall seek, and shall not find me, and where I am, ye cannot come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? Will he go to the dispersed among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me? And where I am, ye cannot come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>On the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>He that believeth on me, out of his belly (as the scripture hath said) shall flow rivers of living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>This he spake of the Spirit, which they who believed on him were to receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>Many of the people therefore hearing this discourse, said, Certainly this is the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Others said, This is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'>But some said, Doth Christ come out of Galilee? Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>So there was a division among the people concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>And some of them would have seized him; but no man laid hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>So the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have ye not brought him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'>The Pharisees answered, Are ye also deceived?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'>Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'>But this populace, who know not the law, are accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'>Nicodemus (he that had come to Jesus by night, being one of them) saith to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.51'>Doth our law judge a man before it hear him, and know what he doth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.52'>They answered and said to him, Art thou also a Galilean?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>And the scribes and Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery, and having set her in the midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>They say to him, Master, this woman was taken actually committing adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'>Now Moses hath commanded us in the law, to stoee such.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>What therefore sayest t`ou? This they spoke tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooping down, wrote with his finger on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>And as they continued asking him, he raised himself and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>But they who heard it, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>Then Jesus raising himself up, and seeing none but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>She saith, No man, Sir. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee. Go, and sin no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'>Then spake Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that followeth me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.13'>The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou testifiest of thyself; thy testimony is not valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.14'>Jesus answered and said to them, Tho' I testify of myself, yet my testimony is valid: for I know whence I came, and whither I go: but ye know not whence I came, or whither I go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'>Ye judge after the flesh: I judge no man. And yet if I judge, my judgment is valid; for I am not alone:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.16'>but I and the Father that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.17'>Even in your law it is written, The testimony of two men is valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.18'>I am one that testify of myself, and the Father that sent me, testifieth of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>Then said they to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me nor my Father. If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'>These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. And no man seized him; for his hour was not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>Then said Jesus again to them, I go, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.22'>Whither I go, ye cannot come. The Jews said therefore, Will he kill himself? Because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith to them, Even what I say to you from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true, and I speak to the world the things which I have heard from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>They understood not, that he spake to them of the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>Jesus therefore saith to them, When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>As he spake these words, many believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'>Then said Jesus to the Jews who believed on him, If ye continue in my word, ye are my disciples indeed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.32'>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>They answered him, We are Abraham's offspring, and were never inslaved to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.36'>If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye will be free indeed. I know that ye are Abraham's offspring:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'>yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.38'>I speak that which I have seen with my father, and ye do that which ye have heard from your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them, If ye were the children of Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'>But now ye seek to kill me, a man who hath told you the truth which I have heard from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>Abraham did not thus. Ye do the deeds of your father. They said to him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>Jesus said to them, If God were your father, ye would love me; for I proceeded forth, and come from God. I am come not of myself, but He hath sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>Why do ye not understand my discourse? Even because ye cannot hear my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>Ye are of your father the devil, and your will is, to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth; for there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>But because I speak the truth, ye believe me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'>Which of you convicteth me of sin? And if I speak the truth, why do ye not believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'>He that is of God, heareth God's words; ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'>Then answered the Jews and said to him, Say we not well, That thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'>I seek not my own glory; there is one that seeketh it and judgeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>Verily, verily I say unto you, if a man keep my word, he shall never see death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Whom makest thou thyself? Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me, of whom ye say, He is our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>Yet ye have not known him: but I know him. And if I should say, I know him not, I should be a liar like you; but I know him, and keep his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Your father Abraham longed to see my day; and he saw it and was glad.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now one Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha, was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>(It was that Mary, who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick) Therefore his sisters sent to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>saying, Lord, behold he whom thou lovest is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>Jesus hearing it, said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. So after he had heard that he was sick,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>he abode still two days in the place where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after this he saith to his disciples, Let us go into Judea again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples say to him, Master, the Jews but now sought to stone thee, and goest thou thither again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if any man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>Thus he spake, and after that he saith to them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go to awake him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>Then the disciples said, Lord, if he sleep, he will recover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>Jesus spake of his death, but they thought he had spoken of the natural rest in sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then said Jesus to them plainly, Lazarus is dead. And I am glad for your sake I was not there, that ye may believe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>but let us go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then said Thomas, called Didymus, to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>When Jesus came, he found he had been now four days in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>(Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But I know even now, that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus saith to her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, tho' he die, yet shall he live;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>Believest thou this? She saith to him, Yea, Lord, I believe thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>Having said this, she went and privately called Mary her sister, saying, The master is come, and calleth for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>As soon as she heard it, she arose quickly and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was at the place where Martha had met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews then who were with her in the house and comforted her, seeing Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb, to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>When Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned deeply,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>and troubled himself, And said, Where have ye laid him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>They say to him, Lord, come and see. Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>Then said the Jews, Behold, how he loved him! And some of them said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>Could not this person, who opened the eyes of the blind, have even caused that this man should not have died?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus again groaning in himself, cometh to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus saith, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the deceased, saith to him, Lord, by this time he stinketh; for he hath been buried four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus saith to her, Said I not to thee, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>Then they took away the stone from where the dead lay. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>Father, I thank thee, that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but I spake this, because of the people who stand by, that they may believe thou hast sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And having spoken thus, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>And he that had been dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was wrapt about with a napkin. Jesus saith to them, Loose him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many therefore of the Jews who were come to Mary, and had seen the things, which Jesus had done, believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>Then the chief priests and elders assembled a council and said, What do we?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>For this man doth many miracles. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him, and the Romans will come and subvert both our place and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>And one of them, Caiaphas, being the high priest that year,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>said to them, Ye know nothing, Nor consider, it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>He spake not this of himself, but being high-priest that year, he prophesied, that Jesus should die for the nation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>And not for that nation only, but that he might also gather into one all the children of God that were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>Therefore from that day, they consulted together to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews, but went thence into the country, near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>And the passover of the Jews was nigh; and many went up to Jerusalem, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>Then sought they for Jesus, and said one to another, What think ye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>That he will not come to the feast? Now both the chief priests and Pharisees had given order, That if any man knew where he was, he should shew it, that they might apprehend him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Then Jesus, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>There they made him a supper, and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them who sat at table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Then Mary, taking a pound of ointment, of very costly spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>faith, Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>This he said, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the purse, and bare what was put therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Then Jesus said, Let her alone; against the day of my burial hath she kept this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>Ye have the poor always with you: but me ye have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>Now much people of the Jews knew that he was there, and came not only for the sake of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the chief priests consulted, how to kill Lazarus also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>Because, on his account, many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>The next day, a great multitude who were come to the feast, having heard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, Took branches of palm-trees, and went out to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jesus having got a young ass,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>rode thereon, as it is written, Fear not, daughter of Sion; behold thy king cometh, sitting on an asses colt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>These things his disciples understood not at first; but when Jesus had been glorified, then they remembered, that these things were written of of him, and that they had done these things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>And the people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>For this cause also the multitude went to meet him, because they heard, he had done this miracle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees therefore said to each other, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? Behold the world is gone after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now among those who came up to worship at the feast, there were certain Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>These came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we desire to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip cometh and telleth Andrew; and Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Verily, verily I say unto you, Unless a grain of wheat that falleth into the ground die, it remaineth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>But for this cause I came, for this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then a voice came from heaven, I have both glorified, and I will glorify it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The multitude who stood and heard it, said, It thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>(He spake this, signifying what death he should die.) The people answered him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>We have heard out of the law, that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Who is this Son of man? Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness overtake you, for he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become children of light. These things spake Jesus, and retiring concealed himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But tho' he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>So that the word of the prophet Isaiah was fulfilled which he said, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Therefore they could not believe, according to what Isaiah said again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts, that they might not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and be converted, that I might heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed on him, but they did not confess him, because of the Pharisees, lest they should be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>Jesus said with a loud voice, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me, may not continue in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I am not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing his hour was come to pass out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>And while they were at supper (the devil having now put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>to betray him) Jesus knowing the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come forth from God, and going to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>Riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments, and taking a towel, girded himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>After that, he poured water into the bason, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel, wherewith he was girded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>Then cometh he to Simon Peter, who saith to him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.7'>Jesus answered and said to him, What I do, thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.8'>Peter saith to him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.9'>Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus saith to him, He who hath been bathed, needeth only to wash his feet, and is clean all over: and ye are clean; but not all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>For he knew who would betray him: therefore he said, Ye are not all clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>So after he had washed their feet, he took his garments, and sitting down again, said to them, Know ye what I have done to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.13'>Ye call me Master and Lord; and ye say well; for so I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.14'>If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye ought also to wash one another's feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.15'>For I have given you an example, that ye also may do as I have done to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.16'>Verily, verily I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.17'>If ye know these things, happy are ye, if ye do them. I speak not of you all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.18'>I know whom I have chosen, that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, hath lift up his heel against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.19'>Now I tell you before it is done, that, when it is done, ye may believe that I am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.20'>Verily, verily I say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me, and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.21'>Jesus having said this, was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily I say unto you, one of you will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.22'>Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.23'>Now there was lying in the bosom of Jesus, one of the disciples whom Jesus loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.24'>Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, to ask who it was of whom he spake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.25'>He then, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to him, Lord, who is it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.26'>Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give the sop when I have dipped it. And having dipped the sop, he giveth it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.27'>And after the sop, then Satan entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.28'>Then said Jesus to him, What thou dost, do quickly. Now none at the table knew, why he said this to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.29'>But some thought, as Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him, Buy what we have need of against the feast, or, Give something to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.30'>He then having received the sop, went out immediately. And it was night, when he went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.31'>Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.32'>If God be glorified by him, God will also glorify him with himself, and will shortly glorify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.33'>Little children, yet a little while I am with you: ye shall seek me, and as I said to the Jews, Whither I go ye cannot come, so now I say to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.34'>A new commandment I give you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.35'>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.36'>Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.37'>Peter saith to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.38'>Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily I say to thee, the cock shall not have crowed, till thou hast denied me thrice.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.14.1'>Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God: believe also in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.2'>In my Father's house are many mansions; if not, I would have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.3'>I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, that where I am, ye may be also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.4'>And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.5'>Thomas saith to him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest, and how can we know the way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.6'>Jesus saith, I am the way; and the truth, and the life; no man cometh to the Father, but by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.7'>If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: from henceforth ye have known him, and have seen him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.8'>Philip saith to him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.9'>Jesus saith to him, Have I been so long with you, and hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father: and how sayest thou, Shew us the Father?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.10'>Believest thou not, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself; and the Father that dwelleth in me, he doth the works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.11'>Believe me, because I am in the Father, and the Father in me; but if not, believe me for the sake of the works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.12'>Verily, verily I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works which I do, shall he do also; and greater than these shall he do, because I go to my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.13'>And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified thro' the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.14'>If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.15'>If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Comforter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.16'>to remain with you for ever, Even the Spirit of truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.17'>whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him. But ye know him; for he remaineth with you, and shall be in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.18'>I will not leave you orphans; I come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.19'>Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more: but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.20'>At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.21'>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me, shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.22'>Judas (not Iscariot) saith to him, Lord, how is it, that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.23'>Jesus answered and said to him, If any man love me, he will keep my words; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.24'>He that loveth me not, keepeth not my words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.25'>These things have I spoken to you, while I remained with you. But the Comforter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.26'>the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and will bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.27'>Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.28'>Ye heard me say to you, I go, and come again to you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoyced, because I said, I go to the Father; for my Father is greater than me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.29'>And now I have told you, before it come to pass, that when it is come to pass, ye may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.30'>Hereafter I shall not talk much with with you; for the prince of this world is coming; but he hath nothing in me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.31'>But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, so I do. Arise, let us go hence.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.15'>
        <verse osisID='John.15.1'>I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.2'>and every one that beareth fruit, he purifieth it, that it may bear more fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.3'>Now ye are pure thro' the word which I have spoken to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.4'>Abide in me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so neither can ye, unless ye abide in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.5'>I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me and I in him, he beareth much fruit; but, separate from me, ye can do nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.6'>If any one abide not in me, he is cast out as a branch, and is withered: and they gather and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.7'>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.8'>Hereby is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit: so shall ye be my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.9'>As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.10'>Abide ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.11'>I have spoken these things to you, that my joy might remain in you, and your joy might be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.12'>This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.13'>No one hath greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.14'>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. I no longer call you servants,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.15'>for the servant knoweth not what his lord doth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard from my Father, I have made known to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.16'>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you that ye may go and bear fruit, and your fruit may remain; that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.17'>This I command you, that ye love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.18'>If the world hate you, ye know it hated me, before it hated you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.19'>If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.20'>Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you: if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.21'>But all these things will they do to you, for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.22'>If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.23'>He that hateth me, hateth my Father also. If I had not done among them the works which no other did, they had not had sin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.24'>but now have they seen them, and yet hated both me and my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.25'>So that the word which is written in their law is fulfilled, They hated me without a cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.26'>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.27'>Ye also testify, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.16.3'>These things will they do, because they have not known the Father nor me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.4'>But I have told you these things, that when the time shall come, ye may remember I told you them. I did not tell you these things at the beginning, because I was with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.5'>But now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.6'>But because I have told you this, sorrow hath filled your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.7'>But I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go: for if I go not, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.8'>And he coming will convince the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.9'>Of sin, because they believe not on me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.10'>Of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye see me no more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.11'>Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.12'>I have yet many things to say to you; but ye cannot bear them now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.13'>But when he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak of himself: but whatsoever he shall hear, he will speak; and he will shew you things to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.14'>He will glorify me; for he will take of mine, and shew it you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.15'>All things that the Father hath, are mine: therefore I said, He will take of mine, and shew it you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.16'>A little while and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.17'>Then some of his disciples said to each other, What is this that he said to us? A little while and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while and ye shall see me? and, Because I go to the Father?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.18'>They said therefore, What is this little while that he speaketh of? We understand not what he saith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.19'>Jesus knew they were desirous to ask him, and said to them, Ye inquire among you of this, that I said, A little while and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while and ye shall see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.20'>Verily, verily I say unto you, Ye will weep and lament; but the world will rejoice: ye will be sorrowful; but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.21'>A woman when she is in travel, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she is delivered of the child, she no longer remembreth the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.1'>Jesus having spoken these words, went forth with his disciples over the brook Kedron, where was a garden, into which he entered and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.2'>And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus had often met there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.3'>Judas then having received a troop of soldiers, and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns, and torches, and arms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.4'>Then Jesus knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth and said to them, Whom seek ye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.5'>They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith to them, I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.6'>As soon as he said to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.7'>He asked them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.8'>Jesus answered, I have told you, I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.9'>That the saying might be fulfilled which he had spoke, Of them whom thou hast given me, I have lost none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.10'>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right-ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.11'>Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up the sword into its scabbard. The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.12'>Then the soldiers, and the captain, and the officers of the Jews took Jesus and bound him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.13'>And led him away to Annas first (for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.14'>Caiaphas was he who had counselled the Jews, that it was expedient one man should die for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.15'>Now Simon Peter followed Jesus, and another disciple. That disciple was known to the high priest, and went with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.16'>But Peter stood at the door without: therefore the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, and spake to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.17'>Then saith the maid, who kept the door, to Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.18'>He saith, I am not. And the servants and officers, having made a fire of coals (for it was cold) stood and warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them and warmed himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.19'>Then the high priest asked Jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.20'>Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I was continually teaching in the synagogue and in the temple, whither all the Jews resort, and in secret have I said nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.21'>Why askest thou me? Ask them that heard me, what I said to them: behold, they know what I said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.22'>When he had said thus, one of the officers, who stood by, gave Jesus a blow, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.23'>Jesus answered, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.24'>(Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.25'>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied and said, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.26'>One of the servants of the high priest (being kinsman to him whose ear Peter had cut off) saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.27'>Peter denied again, and immediately the cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.28'>Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor's palace, and it was early: and they went not into the palace themselves, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, What accusation do ye bring against this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They answered and said to him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>Then said Pilate to them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>So the saying of Jesus was fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Then Pilate returned into the palace, and called Jesus, and said to him, Art thou the king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this of thyself? or did others tell it thee of me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thy own nation, even the chief priests, have delivered thee to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>What hast thou done? Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have fought, that I might not be delivered to the Jews: but my kingdom is not from hence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate said to him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest. I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice. Pilate saith to him, What is truth? And having said this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them, I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But ye have a custom, that I should release to you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release to you the king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers having platted a crown of thorns, put it on his head, and put on him a purple robe, And said, Hail, king of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>And they smote him on the cheeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Pilate went out again, and saith to them, Lo, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know, I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Then Jesus came forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe, And he saith to them, Behold the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>But when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify, crucify him. Pilate saith to them, Take ye him and crucify him; for I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilate heard that saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>he was the more afraid, And returned into the palace and saith to Jesus, Whence art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>But Jesus gave him no answer. Then Pilate saith to him, Speakest thou not to me? Knowest thou not, that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power over me, unless it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me to thee, hath the greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not a friend to Cesar. Whosoever maketh himself a king, opposeth Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>Pilate hearing this saying, brought Jesus forth, and sat on the judgment seat, in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>(It was then the preparation of the passover, and about the third hour:) And saith to the Jews, Behold your king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, Away with him, away with him. Pilate saith to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then delivered he him to them, to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And they took Jesus and led him away. And he bearing his cross, went forth to the place, called the place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>Where they crucified him, and two others with him, one on each side, and Jesus in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate wrote an inscription also, and put it on the cross: and the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>Many of the Jews read this inscription; for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Then said the chief priests to Pilate, Write not, the king of the Jews; but that he said, I am the king of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>And the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part, and also his vesture: now the vesture was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>They said therefore one to another, Let us not rent it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and cast lots for my vesture. These things therefore the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>Jesus therefore seeing his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus knowing, that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar. And filling a sponge with vinegar, and putting it on a stalk of hyssop, they put it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>When Jesus had taken the vinegar, he said, It is finished, and bowing the head, he gave up the Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>Now because it was the preparation, lest the bodies should remain upon the cross on the sabbath (for that sabbath was a great day) the Jews besought Pilate, that their legs might be broken, and they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But coming to Jesus, when they saw he was dead already, they brake not his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and forthwith there came out blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he that saw, hath testified it, and his testimony is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of it shall not be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they have pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea (being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews) asked Pilate leave, to take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore and took the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And Nicodemus also came (who at first had come to Jesus by night) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>So they took the body of Jesus, and wrapped it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulchre, in which no man had ever been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>There therefore they laid Jesus, because of the preparation -day of the Jews; for the sepulchre was nigh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>The first day of the week, cometh Mary Magdalene early, while it was yet dark, to the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>Then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Then Peter went out and the other disciple, and ran toward the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>They both ran together: but the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>And stooping down, he saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, And the napkin that was about his head,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>not lying with the linen clothes, but folded up in a place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple, who came first to the sepulchre, went in; and he saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they said to her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them, They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus saith to her, Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou? She supposing him to be the gardiner, saith to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus saith to her, Mary!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>She turning, saith to him, Rabboni; that is, Master. Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>The same day, the first day of the week, at evening, the doors being shut, where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith to them, Peace be unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And having said this, he shewed them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>But ye shall receive power, the Holy Ghost being come upon you, and shall be witnesses to me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>And having spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him from their sight.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>behold two men, in white apparel, stood by them, Who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing into heaven? This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, as ye have seen him going into heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>And when they were come in, they went up into the upper-room, where both Peter and James, and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Jude the brother of James tarried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>These all continued unanimously in prayer and supplication with the women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>And in these days, Peter standing up in the midst of the disciples, (the number of persons together was about an hundred and twenty) said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>Men, brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost spake before by the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity, and falling down on his face, he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>And it was known to all that dwell at Jerusalem, so that that field is called, in their own tongue, Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His office let another take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>Wherefore of these men who have been with us all the time that the Lord Jesus was going in and out over us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>Beginning from the baptism of John, till the day that he was taken up from us, one must be ordained, to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>And they prayed and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, shew which of these two thou hast chosen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>To take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, to go to his own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>And they gave forth their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>And when the day of Pentecost was come, they were all with one accord in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>And suddenly there was a sound from heaven, as of a rushing, violent wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>And there appeared to them distinct tongues, as of fire; and it sat upon each of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together and were confounded, because every man heard them speaking in his own language.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and dwellers in Mesopotamia, and Judea,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man pointed out to you of God, by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God wrought by him in the midst of you, as yourselves also know:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands, have crucified and slain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death, as it was not possible that he should be held under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>For David speaketh concerning him, I have seen the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right-hand, that I may not be moved.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>For thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades, neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt fill me with joy by thy countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>Men and brethren, I may say to you freely of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is among us to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, That of the fruit of his loins one should sit on his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>He foreseeing this, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in Hades, neither did his flesh see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>This Jesus God hath raised up, whereof all we are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>Being therefore exalted by the right-hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>For David is not ascended into the heavens; but he saith himself, The Lord said to my Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>Sit thou on my right-hand, Until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, That God hath made this Jesus whom ye crucified, both Lord and Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>And hearing this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>And Peter said, Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>Then they, gladly receiving his word, were baptized; and there were added to them that day about three thousand souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>And they continued stedfast in the teaching of the apostles, and the fellowship, and the breaking of bread, and the prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were wrought by the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>And all that believed were together, and had all things common,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, as any one had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>And continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking the bread at home, they ate their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added daily to the church those who were saved.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>Now Peter and John went up together into the temple, at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>And a certain man, lame from his mother's womb, was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple, called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that were entering into the temple, Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>asked an alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>And Peter, looking stedfastly upon him, with John, said, Look on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>Then said Peter, Silver and gold have I none; but what I have, I give thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>And taking him by the right-hand, he lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankle-bones were strengthened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>And leaping up, he stood and walked, and went with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>And all the people saw him walking and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>And they knew him, that this was he who had sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple, and were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had befallen him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them, in the portico that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>And Peter seeing it, answered the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? Or, why do ye fix your eyes on us, as if by our own power or piety, we had made this man to walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his son Jesus, whom ye delivered up, and renounced him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>But ye renounced the holy one and the just, and desired a murderer to be granted you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>But ye killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead, whereof we are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>And his name, thro' faith in his name, hath strengthened this man, whom ye see and know; yea, the faith which is by him, hath given him this perfect soundness, in the presence of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>And now, brethren, I know that thro' ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>But God hath thus fulfilled the things which he foretold by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, that the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>And he may send to you Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>who was before appointed, Whom heaven must receive, till the times of the restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>For Moses truly said to the fathers, The Lord your God shall raise you up a prophet of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say to you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and them that followed, whosoever have spoken, have also foretold these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>Ye are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold till the next day: for it was now evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>But many of them who had heard the word, believed. And the number of the men was about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>And on the morrow were gathered together at Jerusalem their rulers,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>And having set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost, said to them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>If we are examined this day, of the benefit done to the impotent man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>by what means he is healed, Be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God hath raised from the dead, by him doth this man stand before you whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>This is the stone which was set at nought by you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>And seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and understanding that they were illiterate and uneducated men, they marvelled, and took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>And beholding the man who had been healed, standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>But having ordered them to go out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>saying, What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a signal miracle hath been wrought by them, is manifest to all that dwell at Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>Yet that it spread no farther among the people, let us severely threaten them, that they speak no more to any man in this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>And having called them, they charged them, Not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John answering, said to them, Whether it be righteous in the sight of God, to obey you rather than God, judge ye.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>And having threatened them again, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for they all glorified God for that which was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>For the man on whom this miracle of healing had been wrought, was above forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>And being let go, they went to their own company, and related all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>And when they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art the God who madest heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.8.36'>And as they went on the way, they came to a certain water. And the eunuch said, Behold water: what hindereth me to be baptized?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.28'>And he was with them, coming in and going out at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>And preaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, he disputed with the Hellenists: but they attempted to kill him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.30'>Which the brethren knowing, brought him down to Cesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>Then the church through all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria had peace: and being built up, and walking in the fear of God, and the comfort of the Holy Ghost, was multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>And as Peter passed through all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>And he found there a certain man named Eneas, who had kept his bed eight years, being ill of a palsy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>And Peter said to him, Eneas, Jesus Christ healeth thee. Arise and make thy bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>And he arose immediately. And all that dwelt in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>Now there was at Joppa, a certain disciple, named Tabitha, which is by interpretation Dorcas; this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.37'>And in those days she was sick and died; whom having washed, they laid in an upper chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>And Lydda being near Joppa, the disciples hearing Peter was there, sent to him two men, desiring that he would not delay to come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>Then Peter arose and went with them; whom being come, they brought into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>But Peter, having put them all out, kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>And giving her his hand, and having called the saints and widows, he presented her alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>And it was known through all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.43'>And he tarried many days in Joppa, with one Simon, a tanner.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>And there was a certain man in Cesarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of that called the Italian band,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>A devout man, and fearing God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>He saw plainly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of the Lord coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>And looking stedfastly on him, and being affrighted, he said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thy alms are come up for a memorial before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>And now send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>He lodgeth with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>And when the angel who spake to him was departed, he called two of his houshold-servants, and a devout soldier, of them that waited on him continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>And having declared to them all these things, he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>On the morrow, as they journeyed and drew nigh to the city, Peter went up on the house-top, to pray, about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>And he became very hungry, and would have eaten; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel like a great sheet, tied at the four corners, descending to him, and let down on the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>Wherein were all four-footed creatures of the earth, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>And a voice came to him, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>But Peter said, In no wise, Lord: for I have never eaten any thing common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>And the voice came to him again, the second time, What God hath purified, call not thou common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>This was done thrice, and the vessel was taken up again to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>Now while Peter doubted in himself, what the vision he had seen should mean, behold the men sent by Cornelius, having inquired out Simon's house, stood at the gate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>And calling asked, Whether Simon, surnamed Peter, lodged there?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>While Peter was musing on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, men seek thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>Arise therefore and go down, and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>Then Peter going down to the men, said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: for what cause are ye come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and fearing God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned of God by an holy angel, to send for thee to his house, and to hear words from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>And he invited them in and lodged them. And the next day, Peter went away with them; and certain brethren from Joppa went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>And the day following they entered into Cesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and near friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and falling down at his feet, worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>But Peter raised him up saying, Arise: I myself also am a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>And he said to them, Ye know it is unlawful for a Jew to join with or come to one of another nation; but God hath shewed me, to call no man common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>Therefore being sent for, I came without gain-saying. I ask therefore, for what intent ye have sent for me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting till this hour, and at the ninth hour I was praying in my house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>and behold a man stood before me in bright clothing, And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are remembred before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, who is surnamed Peter: he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner by the sea, who being come, shall speak to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou hast done well in coming. Now therefore we are all present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>Then Peter opening his mouth, said, I perceive of a truth that God is not a respecter of persons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>This is the word which he sent to the children of Israel, preaching the glad tidings of peace through Jesus Christ; He is Lord of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>Ye know the word which was published through all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom yet they slew and hanged on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>(Not to all the people, but to witnesses, chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him) after he rose from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>And he commanded us, to proclaim to the people, and to testify, that it is he who is ordained by God the Judge of the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>To him give all the prophets witness, that every one who believeth in him, shall receive forgiveness of sins through his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all that were hearing the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>And the believers of the circumcision, as many as came with Peter, were amazed, that the gift of the Holy Ghost was poured out on the Gentiles also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>For they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>Then Peter answered, Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost, even as we?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they prayed him to tarry certain days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard, that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they of the circumcision debated with him, saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>and didst eat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>Then Peter beginning, laid all things before them in order, saying, I was praying in the city of Joppa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>and being in a trance, I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down from heaven by the four corners, and it came even to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>On which looking stedfastly, I observed and saw four-footed creatures of the earth, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>And I heard a voice saying to me, Rise Peter, kill and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>But I said, In no wise, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>And the voice from heaven answered me again, What God hath purified, call not thou common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>This was done thrice, and all were drawn up again into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>And behold immediately three men stood at the house where I was, sent from Cesarea to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>And the Spirit bad me go with them, doubting nothing: these six brethren also went with me, and we entered into the man's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>And he told us, how he had seen an angel standing in his house, and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and call Simon,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>If then God gave to them the same gift as even to us, having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that could withstand God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>When they heard these things, they were quiet, and glorified God, saying, Then God hath given to the Gentiles also repentance unto life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>Now they who had been scattered abroad by the distress which arose about Stephen, travelled as far as Phenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching to none but Jews only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who coming into Antioch, spake to the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>And the hand of the Lord was with them; and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>And tidings of these things came to the ears of the church that was in Jerusalem, and they sent forth Barnabas, to go to Antioch:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>Who coming and seeing the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, to cleave unto the Lord with full purpose of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and faith. And a considerable multitude was added to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>Then went he to Tarsus to seek Saul; and having found him, he brought him to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>And a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught a considerable multitude: and the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>In those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch. And one of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>named Agabus stood up, and signified by the Spirit, that there would be a great famine through all the world; which also came to pass under Claudius Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>Then the disciples determined to send relief, every one according to his ability, to the brethren who dwelt in Judea: Which also they did,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.12.1'>About that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to afflict a certain of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>And he slew James, the brother of John, with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>And perceiving it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to take Peter also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>(Then were the days of unleavened bread. ) Whom having apprehended, he put in prison, delivering him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him, intending to bring him forth to the people after the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>So Peter was kept in the prison; but continual prayer was made to God by the church for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>And when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and the guards before the door were keeping the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood over him, and light shined in the house: and smiting Peter on the side he waked him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>And the angel said to him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals; and he did so. And he saith to him, Throw thy garment about thee, and follow me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>When they had passed the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate that leadeth to the city, which opened to them of its own accord: and going out, they went on through one street; and immediately the angel departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>And Peter coming to himself, said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>And having considered, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John surnamed Mark, where many were gathered together praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>And as he knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>And knowing Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for joy, but running in, told them, that Peter stood before the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>And they said to her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed, it was so. Then they said, It is his angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>But Peter continued knocking. And opening the door, they saw him and were astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>But he beckoning to them with his hand, to be silent, declared to them, How the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Shew these things to James and to the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>And going out, he went to another place. Now when it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, What was become of Peter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>And Herod having sought for him, and not found him, examined the guard, and commanded them to be put to death. And going down from Judea to Cesarea, he abode there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>And he was highly incensed against them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and having gained Blastus, the king's chamberlain, sued for peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>And on a set day, Herod arrayed in royal apparel, and sitting on his throne, made an oration to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>And the people shouted, It is the voice of God, and not of a man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.42'>And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought them, that these words might be spoken to them on the sabbath between.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.43'>And when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who speaking to them, persuaded them, to continue in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.44'>And the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together, to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.45'>But the Jews seeing the multitudes, were filled with zeal, and spake against the things spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.46'>Then Paul and Barnabas speaking boldly, said, It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first; but seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold! we turn to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.47'>For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set Thee for a light of the Gentiles, that Thou mightest be for salvation to the ends of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.48'>And the Gentiles hearing it were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life, believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.49'>And the word of the Lord was spread through all that country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.50'>But the Jews stirred up the devout, honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.51'>And they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and went to Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.52'>And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.1'>And in Iconium they went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great multitude both of the Jews and Greeks believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.2'>But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil-affected against the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.3'>Yet they abode a long time speaking boldly in the Lord, who bare witness to the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.4'>But the multitude of the city was divided; and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.7'>And preached the gospel there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.8'>And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, having been a cripple from his mother's womb, who had never walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.9'>This man heard Paul speaking; who fixing his eyes upon him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Him Paul would have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him, because of the Jews who were in those places; for they all knew his father, that he was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>And as they went through the cities, they gave them the decrees, which were determined by the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem to keep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.5'>And the churches were established in the faith, and increased in number daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.6'>And having gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, being forbid by the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>And passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas. And a vision appeared to Paul by night:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>a man of Macedonia stood and intreated him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.10'>And as soon as he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia, assuredly inferring, that the Lord called us to preach the gospel to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.11'>Sailing therefore from Troas, we ran with a strait course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.12'>And from thence to Philippi, which is the first city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>And we abode in that city certain days. And on the sabbath we went out of the city, by the river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and sitting down, we spake to the women who were come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, a worshiper of God, heard; whose heart the Lord opened to assent to the things which were spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>And when she was baptized and her family, she intreated us saying, Since ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there. And she constrained us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>And as we were going to prayer, a certain damsel, possest by a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by prophesying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>She following after Paul and us, cried out, saying, These men are servants of the most high God, who declare to us the way of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>And this she did for many days. But Paul being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ, to go out of her. And he came out the same hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>But when her owners saw, that the hope of their gain was gone, laying hold of Paul and Silas, they dragged them into the market-place to the magistrates,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>And having brought them to the pretors, they said, These men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>being Jews, exceedingly trouble our city, And teach customs, which it is not lawful for us, being Romans, to receive, neither to observe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>And the multitude rose up together against them; and the pretors tearing off their garments, commanded to beat them with rods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>Who having received such a charge, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>But at midnight Paul and Silas having prayed, sung an hymn to God: and the prisoners heard them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>And suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>And the jailor awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison opened, drew his sword, and was going to kill himself, supposing the prisoners were fled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>And having brought them out he said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved and thy houshold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>And they spake the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>And taking them that very hour of the night, he washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized, he and all his houshold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>And having brought them up into his house, he set a table before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with his whole house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>And when it was day, the pretors sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>And the jailor told these things to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But Paul said to them, They have beaten us publickly, uncondemned, and have cast us into prison, who are Romans: and do they now thrust us out privately? Nay verily: but let them come themselves and conduct us out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>And the serjeants reported these words to the pretors; and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>And coming out of the prison, they entered into the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them and departed.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>And taking their journey through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>And Paul, according to his custom, went in to them, and three sabbath-days discoursed with them from the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>Opening them and evincing, That Christ ought to suffer, and to rise from the dead, and that this is the Christ, even Jesus, whom I declare unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>And some of them believed, and were joined to Paul and Silas, and a great number of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the principal women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But the Jews who believed not, filled with zeal, taking to them some of the mean and profligate fellows, and making a mob, set all the city in an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, sought to bring them out to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>But not finding them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying aloud, These men, that have turned the world upside down, are come hither also:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>Whom Jason hath privately received; and all these men act contrary to the decrees of Cesar, saying, that there is another king, one Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>However having taken security of Jason and of the rest, they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea, who coming thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>These were more ingenuous than those of Thessalonica, receiving the word with all readiness of mind, and daily searching the scriptures, whether those things were so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>Therefore many of them believed, and of the Grecian women of considerable rank, and of the men not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>But when the Jews of Thessalonica knew that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea also, they came thither likewise, and stirred up the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>Then the brethren sent away Paul immediately, to go as it were to the sea; but Silas and Timothy continued there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens, and having received an order to Silas and Timothy, to come to him with all speed, they departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>Now, while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him, seeing the city wholly given to idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>He therefore discoursed in the synagogue to the Jews and the devout persons, and in the market-place daily to those whom he met with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>Then some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers incountered him: and some said, What would this babler say? Others, he seemeth to be a proclaimer of strange gods; because he preached to them Jesus, and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, which is spoken by thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears; we would therefore know, what these things mean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>(For all the Athenians, and the strangers sojourning there, spent their time in nothing else, but telling or hearing some new thing.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>Then Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that ye are greatly addicted to the worship of invisible powers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>For as I passed along and beheld the objects of your worship, I found an altar, on which was inscribed, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD: him therefore whom ye worship without knowing him, I proclaim unto you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>That they might seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he be not far from every one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>For in him we live and move, and have our being; as certain likewise of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think the Godhead is like gold or silver, or stone, graven by art and contrivance of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>The times of ignorance indeed God overlooked; but he now commandeth all men every where to repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>Because he hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world righteously, by the man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given assurance to all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>And when they heard of the resurrection from the dead, some mocked: but others said, We will hear thee again concerning this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>So Paul departed from among them. Howbeit, some clave to him and believed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>among whom was even Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>After these things, Paul departing from Athens, came to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>And finding a certain Jew name Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy with Priscilla his wife (because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome) he went to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>And as he was of the same trade, he abode with them and wrought, for they were tent-makers by trade.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>And he discoursed in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in spirit, and testified to the Jews, that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>But when they set themselves in opposition and blasphemed, he shook his raiment and said to them, Your blood is upon your own head; I am pure: from henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>And going thence, he went into the house of one named Justus, one that worshiped God, whose house was adjoining to the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>Then the Lord said to Paul by a vision, in the night, Fear not, but speak and hold not thy peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made an assault with one consent upon Paul, and brought him to the judgment-seat, Saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>And when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were an act of injustice or wicked licentiousness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>And he drove them away from the judgment-seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>Then they all took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>And Paul still continued many days; and then taking leave of the brethren, sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shaved his head at Cenchrea; for he had a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>And he came to Ephesus, and left him there; but he himself going into the synagogue, reasoned with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>But though they intreated him to tarry longer with them, he consented not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>But took his leave of them, saying, I must by all means keep the approaching feast at Jerusalem, but I will return to you again, if God will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>And he set sail from Ephesus. And landing at Cesarea, he went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>And having spent some time there, he departed, and went over the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, confirming all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>Now a certain Jew, Apollos by name, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>And he spake boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla hearing him, took him to their house, and explained to him the way of God more perfectly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>And when he was desirous to go over to Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him; who being come thither, greatly helped through grace them that had believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>For he earnesty debated with the Jews in publick, shewing by the scriptures, that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>Now while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper parts, came to Ephesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>and finding certain disciples, He said to them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost, since ye believed? And they said to him, Nay, we have not so much as heard, Whether there be any Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>He said to them, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe on him that was to come after him, that is on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>And hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>And Paul laying his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon them, and they spake with tongues and prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>And they were in all about twelve men. And going into the synagogue,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>he spake boldly, for three months discoursing and evincing the things concerning the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>But when some were hardened, and would not believe, but spake reproachfully of the way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, discoursing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>And this was done for the space of two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>So that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried from his body to the sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits came out of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>And some of the vagabond Jews, who were exorcists, undertook to name the name of the Lord Jesus, over those who had evil spirits, saying, We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>And there were seven sons of one Sceva a Jewish chief priest, who did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>But the evil spirit answering said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leaping upon them, and getting the mastery of them, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>And this was known to all both Jews and Greeks dwelling at Ephesus, and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>And many of those who believed came, confessing and openly declaring their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>Many also of those who had practised curious arts, bringing their books together, burnt them before all men, and they computed the value of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>So powerfully did the word of God grow and prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>After these things were ended, Paul purposed in spirit, having passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must see Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>And having sent two of those who ministred to him, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, he himself staid in Asia for a season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>And about that time, there arose no small tumult concerning the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>For a man named Demetrius, a silver smith, who made silver shrines of Diana, procured no small gain to the artificers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>Whom having gathered together, with the workmen employed in such things, he said, Sirs, ye know, that our maintenance arises from this occupation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>But ye see and hear, that not at Ephesus only, but almost through all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned aside much people, saying, That they are not gods, which are made with hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>So that there is danger, not only that this our craft should be set at nought, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her majesty destroyed, whom all Asia, and the world worshipeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>And hearing this, they were filled with rage, and cried out, saying, The great Diana of the Ephesians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>And the whole city was filled with confusion; and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's fellow-travellers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>And when Paul would have gone in to the people, the disciples would not suffer him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>And some also of the principal officers of Asia, being his friends, sent to him and desired, that he would not venture himself into the theatre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another; for the assembly was confused, and the greater part did not know, for what they were come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>And they thrust Alexander forward from among the multitude, the Jews pushing him on; and Alexander, waving with his hand, would have made a defence to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>But when they knew that he was a Jew, one voice arose from them all, crying out, for about two hours, The great Diana of the Ephesians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>But the register, having pacified the people, said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who knoweth not, that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>Seeing then these things cannot be denied, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>For ye have brought these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor blasphemers of your goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>If then Demetrius and the artificers that are with him, have a charge against any one, the courts are held, and there are proconsuls; let them implead one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>And indeed we are in danger to be questioned for sedition, concerning this day; there being no cause, whereby we can account for this concourse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.41'>And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>And after the tumult was ceased, Paul calling the disciples to him, and having taken his leave of them, departed to go into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>And having gone through those parts, and exhorted them with much discourse, he came into Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>And having abode there three months, an ambush being laid for him by the Jews, as he was about to sail into Syria, he determined to return by Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>And there accompanied him to Asia Sopater of Berea, and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus, and Secundus, and Caius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>These going before, staid for us at Troas, And we set sail from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>and came to them at Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>And on the first day of the week, when we were met together to break bread, Paul being to depart on the morrow, preached to them, and continued his discourse till midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>And there were many lamps in the upper room where they were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>And a certain young man, named Eutychus, sitting in a window, fell into a deep sleep: and as Paul still continued his discourse, being overpowered with sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>And Paul went down and fell on him; and taking him in his arms, said, Be not troubled; for his life is in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>And going up again, and having broken bread, he conversed long with them, even till break of day, and so departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>But we going before into the ship, sailed to Assos, where we were to take up Paul; for so he had appointed, being himself to go on foot.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>And sailing thence, we came the following day over-against Chios, and the next day we touched at Samos, and having tarried at Trogyllium, the day after came to Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, that he might not spend any time in Asia; for he hasted, if it were possible, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>And sending to Ephesus from Miletus, he called thither the elders of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>And when they were come to him, he said to them, Ye know in what manner I have conversed among you, all the time from the first day I came into Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>Serving the Lord with all humility, and with tears, and trials which befell me through the ambushes of the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>And that I have with-held nothing which was profitable, but have preached to you, and taught you, publickly and from house to house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>Testifying both to Jews and Greeks repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>And now behold, being bound by the Spirit, I go to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.23'>Save that the Holy Ghost testifieth to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life precious to myself, so I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>And now I know that ye all among whom I have conversed, proclaiming the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.26'>Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.27'>For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.28'>Take heed therefore to yourselves and to the whole flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.34'>Yea, you yourselves know, that these hands have ministred to my necessities, and to them that were with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>I have shewed you all things, that thus labouring ye ought to help the infirm, and to remember the word of the Lord Jesus, which he himself said, It is happier to give than to receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>And having said these things, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>And they all wept sore, and falling on Paul's neck kissed him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>What is it therefore? The multitude must needs come together; for they will hear that thou art come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>Therefore do this that we say to thee: there are with us four men, who have a vow on them:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>But some among the multitude cried out one thing, some another; and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>But when he came upon the stairs, he was borne of the soldiers, through the violence of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>For the multitude of people followed after, crying, Away with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he said to the chief captain, May I speak to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>Who said, Canst thou speak Greek? Art not thou that Egyptian, who before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out four thousand murtherers into the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>But Paul said, I am a man who am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, suffer me to speak to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>And when he had given him leave, Paul standing on the stairs, waved his hand to the people: and a great silence being made, he spake to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye now my defence unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>(And when they heard that he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more silence:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>and he saith) I am verily a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and accurately instructed in the law of our fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women: As likewise the high priest is my witness, and all the estate of the elders:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>from whom also I received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them who were there to Jerusalem to be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>But as I journeyed and drew near to Damascus, about noon suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>And they that were with me, saw the light, and were terrified; but they did not hear the voice of him that spake to me, And I said, What shall I do, Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>And the Lord said to me, Rise and go into Damascus, and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed thee to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>And as I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand by them that were with me, I came into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt there, Coming to me, stood and said to me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, to know his will, and see that Just one, and hear the voice of his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>For thou shalt be his witness to all men, of what thou hast seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>And now, why tarriest thou? Arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>And when I was returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>I was in a trance, And saw him saying to me, Make haste and depart quickly out of Jerusalem; for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned, and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting to his death, and kept the garments of them that slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>But he said to me, Depart: for I will send thee far off to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>And they heard him to this word, and then lifted up their voice and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit that he should live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>And as they cried out, and rent their garments, and cast dust into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>The tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle, and ordered him to be examined by scourging, that he might know, for what cause they cried so against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>And as they were binding him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a Roman, even uncondemned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>The centurion hearing it, went and told the tribune, saying, Consider what thou art about to do; for this man is a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>Then the tribune came and said to him, Tell me, Art thou a Roman?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>He said, Yea. And the tribune answered, I purchased this freedom with a great sum of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>And Paul said, But I was free-born. Then they who were going to examine him, immediately departed from him: and the tribune was afraid, after he knew he was a Roman, because he had bound him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>And on the morrow, desiring to know the certainty, what he was accused of by the Jews, he loosed him from his bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come, and bringing Paul down, set him before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>And Paul earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God till this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>And Ananias the high priest commanded them that stood by, to smite him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>Then said Paul to him, God is about to smite thee, thou whited wall. For sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>But they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>Then said Paul, I was not aware, brethren, that it was the high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not revile the ruler of thy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>But Paul perceiving, that the one part were Saducees, and the other Pharisees, cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; for the hope of the resurrection of the dead am I called in question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>And when he had said this, there arose a contention between the Pharisees and the Saducees: and the multitude was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For the Saducees say, there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>And there was a great clamour: and the scribes of the Pharisees side arising, contended, saying, We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>And as a great disturbance arose, the tribune fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>And the night following, the Lord standing by him, said, Be of good courage, Paul: for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so thou must testify at Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>And when it was day, some of the Jews entering into a conspiracy, bound themselves under a curse, saying, That they would neither eat nor drink, till they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>And they were more than forty, who had made this confederacy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves by a solemn curse, not to taste anything, till we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>Now therefore ye with the council signify to the tribune, that he bring him down to you to-morrow, as though ye would more accurately examine the things concerning him: and we, before he came near, are ready to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>But Paul's sister's son, hearing of the ambush, came, and entering into the castle, told Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>And Paul calling to him one of the centurions, said, Conduct this young man to the tribune; for he hath something to tell him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>So he took and led him to the tribune, and said, Paul the prisoner, calling me to him, desired me, to bring this young man to thee, who hath something to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>And the tribune taking him by the hand, and going aside privately asked, What is it, that thou hast to tell me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee, to bring down Paul to-morrow to the council, as if they would enquire something concerning him more accurately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>But do not yield to them; for there are more than forty of them lie in wait, who have bound themselves with a curse, neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, expecting a promise from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>So the tribune dismissed the young man, having charged him, Tell no man, that thou hast discovered these things to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>And having called to him two of the centurions, he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Cesarea, and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, by the third hour of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>And provide beasts, to set Paul upon, and conduct him safe to Felix the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>And he wrote a letter after this manner, Claudius Lysias to the most excellent Governor Felix, greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>As this man was seized by the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>and about to be killed by them, I came with the soldiery and rescued him, having learned, that he was a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>And desiring to know the crime of which they accused him, I brought him before their council: Whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>but to be charged with nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>And when it was shewn me, that an ambush was about to be laid for the man by the Jews, I immediately sent him to thee, commanding his accusers also, to say before thee what they have against him. Farewel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>The soldiers therefore, taking Paul, as it was commanded them, brought him by night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>On the morrow they returned to the castle, leaving the horsemen to go with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>Who entering into Cesarea, and delivering the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>And having read it, he asked, of what province he was?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>And being informed, that he was of Cilicia, I will give thee, said he, a thorough hearing, when thy accusers also are come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's palace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>And after five days, Ananias the high priest came down with the elders, and a certain orator, named Tertullus; and appeared before the governor against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>And he being called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing we enjoy great peace through thee, and that very worthy deeds are done to this nation by thy prudence always, and in all places, We accept it, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>But that I may not trouble thee farther,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>I beseech thee of thy clemency to hear us a few words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>For we have found this man, a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>Who hath also attempted to profane the temple; whom we seized and would have judged according to our law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>But Lysias the tribune coming upon us, with great violence took him away out of our hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>Commanding his accusers to come to thee, whereby thou mayst thyself on examination, take knowledge of all these things of which we accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>Then Paul, after the governor had made a sign to him to speak, answered, Knowing thou hast been for several years a judge to this nation, I the more chearfully answer for myself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>As thou mayst know, that it is but twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>And they neither found me disputing with any man in the temple, nor making an insurrection among the people, either in the synagogues or in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>Nor can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. But this I confess unto thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>that after the way, which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>Having hope in God, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust, which they themselves also expect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>And for this cause do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward God and toward man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purifying in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>Who ought to have been present before thee, and to accuse me, if they had any thing against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>Or let these themselves say, what crime they found in me, when I stood before the council,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>Unless it be concerning this one word, that I cried, standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead, I am called in question by you this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>And when Felix heard these things, he put them off, saying, After I have been more accurately informed concerning this way, when Lysias the tribune cometh down, I will take full cognisance of your affair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>And he commanded the centurion to keep Paul, and let him have liberty, and to hinder none of his friends from assisting or coming to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>And after some days, Felix coming with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>And as he reasoned concerning justice, temperance, and the judgment to come, Felix being terrified, answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>And he hoped also that money would have been given him by Paul to release him; therefore he sent for him the oftner, and discoursed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>But after two years, Felix was succeeded by Portius Festus: and Felix desiring to gratify the Jews, left Paul bound.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he went up from Cesarea to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews, appeared before him against Paul and besought him, Begging favour against him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying an ambush to kill him by the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>But Festus answered, That Paul should be kept at Cesarea, and that he himself would depart thither shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>Therefore let those of you, said he, who are able, go down with me and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>And having tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Cesarea; and the next day, sitting on the judgment-seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>And when he was come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem, stood round about him, bringing many and heavy accusations against Paul, which they were not able to prove:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cesar have I offended at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>But Festus, willing to gratify the Jews, answered Paul and said, Art thou willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged before me concerning these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>Then said Paul, I am standing at Cesar's judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged: I have done no wrong to the Jews, as thou also very well knowest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>For if indeed I have done wrong, and have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there is nothing of the things whereof these accuse me, no man can give me up to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>I appeal to Cesar. Then Festus, having conferred with the council answered, Hast thou appealed to Cesar? To Cesar shalt thou go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>And after certain days, king Agrippa and Bernice came to Cesarea, to salute Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>And when they had been there many days, Festus declared the case of Paul to the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>About whom when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews informed me, desiring judgment against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>To whom I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans, to give up any man, till he that is accused have the accusers face to face, and have liberty to make his defence, touching the crime laid to his charge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>When therefore they were come hither, I without any delay sat at the judgment seat the next day, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>But had certain questions against him, relating to their own religious worship, and about one Jesus that was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>And as I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked, If he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged concerning these matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But Paul appealing to be kept for the hearing of Augustus, I command him to be kept till I could send him to Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would also hear the man myself. And he said, To-morrow thou shalt hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come and Bernice with great pomp, and were entered into the place of audience, with the tribunes and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all ye who are present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have pleaded with me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out, that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>But when I found, that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and he had himself appealed to the Emperor, I determined to send him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>Of whom I have nothing certain to send to my lord: wherefore I have brought him before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that after examination taken, I may have somewhat to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>For it seemeth to me unreasonable, to send a prisoner, and not to signify also the crimes alledged against him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>Then Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>And Paul, stretching forth his hand, made his defence. I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am this day to make my defence before thee, concerning all those things whereof I am accused by the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>Who art accurately acquainted with all the customs and questions which are among the Jews, wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>The manner of my life from my youth which was from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>all the Jews know, Who knew me from the first, (if they would testify) that I lived a Pharisee, after the strictest sect of our religion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>And now I stand in judgment, for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>To which our twelve tribes, worshiping continually night and day, hope to attain: concerning which hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>What? Is it judged by you an incredible thing, that God should raise the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>I indeed thought myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>Which also I did in Jerusalem: and having received authority from the chief priests, I shut up many of the saints in prisons, and when they were killed, I gave my vote against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>And frequently punishing them in all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>Whereupon as I was going to Damascus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>with authority and commission from the chief priests, At mid-day, O king, I saw in the way, a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round me and them that journeyed with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>And when we were all fallen down to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>And I said, Who art thou, Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. But rise and stand upon thy feet; for I have appeared to thee for this purpose, to ordain thee a minister and a witness, both of the things which thou hast seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>and of those in which I will appear to thee, Delivering thee from the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>and the Gentiles, to whom I now send thee, To open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; that they may receive through faith which is in me, forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>From that time, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>But first to them at Damascus and at Jerusalem, and through all the country of Judea, and then to the Gentiles I declare, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>For these things the Jews seizing me in the temple, attempted to kill me with their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>But having obtained help from God, I continue till this day, testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what both the prophets and Moses have declared should be,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>And as he was thus making his defence, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself, much learning doth make thee mad.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>For the king knoweth of these things; to whom also I speak with freedom; for I am persuaded none of these things are hidden from him; for this was not done in a corner.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but likewise all that hear me, were this day both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>And as he said this, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>And as they were going away, they spake one to another, saying, This man doth nothing worthy of death, or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Cesar.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>And as soon as it was determined, that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul, and certain other prisoners, to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan Cohort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>And going aboard a ship of Adramyttium, that was to sail by the coasts of Asia, we set sail, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>And the next day we reached Sidon. And Julius treating Paul courteously, permitted him to go to his friends, to refresh himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>And setting sail from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>And having sailed through the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>And the centurion finding a ship of Alexandria there, bound for Italy, put us on board of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were scarce come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over-against Salmone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>And passing it with difficulty, we came to the Fair Havens, near which was the city Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>And as much time was spent, and sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was already past,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>Paul exhorted them, Saying to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage is like to be with injury and much damage, not only to the lading and the ship, but also to our lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But the centurion regarded the master and the owner of the vessel, more than the things, which were spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>And as the haven was not convenient to winter in, the greater part advised to set sail from thence also, if by any means they might reach Phenice, to winter there, which is an haven of Crete looking to the south-west and north-west.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>And as the south wind blew gently, supposing they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor, and sailed on close by Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called Euroclydon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>And the ship being caught, and not able to bear up against the wind, we let her drive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>And running under a certain Island called Clauda, we were hardly able to get masters of the boat:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>Which having taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship, and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, they struck sail, and so were driven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>And as we were in an exceeding great storm, the next day they lightened the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>And as neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was then taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>But after long abstinence, Paul standing in the midst of them, said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened to me, and not have loosed from Crete, and so have avoided this injury and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>Yet now I exhort you to be of good courage; for there shall be no loss of any life among you, but of the ship only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>For there stood by me this night an angel of the God, whose I am, and whom I serve, Saying, Fear not, Paul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>thou must be presented before Cesar: and lo God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>But we must be cast on a certain island.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>And when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic Sea, the sailors suspected, that they drew nigh some land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>And sounding, they found twenty fathoms; and having gone a little farther, sounding again, they found fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>And fearing lest they should fall upon some rocky ground, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>But when the sailors were attempting to flee out of the ship, and had let down the boat into the sea, under pretence that they were going to carry out anchors from the ship-head,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take food, saying, This day is the fourteenth that ye have tarried and continue fasting, having taken nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>Therefore I exhort you to take food; for this is for your preservation; for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>And having spoken thus, he took bread, and gave thanks to God before them all; and having broken it, he began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>Then were they all incouraged, and they also took meat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>And we were in the ship in all, two hundred and seventy-six souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>And when they were satisfied with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>And when it was day, they did not know the land; but they observed a certain creek having a shore, into which they were minded, if possible, to thrust the ship:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>And having taken up the anchors, they committed it to the sea, at the same time loosing the rudder-bands, and hoisting up the stay-sail to the wind, they made for the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>But falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship a ground; and the fore-part sticking fast, remained immovable, but the hinder-part was broken by the force of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>And the counsel of the soldiers was, to kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim away and escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>But the centurion, being desirous to save Paul, hindered them from their purpose, and commanded those that could swim, throwing themselves into the sea, first to get away to land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship; and so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to land.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>And being escaped, we then knew, that the island was called Melita.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>And the barbarians shewed us uncommon kindness; for having kindled a fire, they brought us all to it, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>Now as Paul was gathering a bundle of sticks, and laying them on the fire, a viper coming from the heat, fastened upon his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>And when the barbarians saw the venomous animal hanging on his hand, they said one to another, Doubtless this man is a murderer, whom though he hath escaped the sea, vengeance hath not suffered to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>But having shaken off the venomous animal into the fire, he felt no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>However they expected, that he would have swollen, or suddenly fallen down dead: but after having waited a considerable time, seeing no mischief befall him, they changed their minds and said, that he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>And near that place was the estate of the chief man of the island, named Publius, who receiving us into his house, entertained us courteously three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>Now the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and bloody flux; to whom Paul went in, and having prayed, laid his hands on him and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>And when this was done, the rest also in the island who had disorders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>came and were healed, Who likewise honoured us with many honours, and when we departed, put on board such things as were necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the island, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>And arriving at Syracuse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>we tarried there three days, Whence coasting round, we came to Rhegium, and the south wind rising after one day, we came the next to Puteoli:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>Where finding brethren, we were intreated to tarry with them seven days, and so we went toward Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>And the brethren having heard of us, came out thence to meet us, some as far as Appii Forum, and others to the Three Taverns, whom when Paul saw, he thanked God and took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself, with the soldier that kept him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>And after three days, Paul called the chief of the Jews together. And when they were come together, he said to them, Brethren, though I have done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet have I been delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>Who having examined me, were willing to have released me, because there was no cause of death in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But when the Jews opposed it, I was constrained to appeal to Cesar; not that I had any thing to accuse my nation of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>For this cause therefore have I intreated, to see and speak with you; for it is on account of the hope of Israel, that I am bound with this chain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>And they said to him, We have neither received letters from Judea concerning thee, nor hath any of the brethren coming hither, related or spoke any evil of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest; for concerning this sect, we know, that it is every where spoken against.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>And having appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he expounded the kingdom of God, testifying and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning till evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>And some believed the things that were spoken, and some believed not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>And not agreeing with each other, they brake up the assembly, after Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by the prophet Isaiah to your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>Saying, Go to this people and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and with their ears they hear heavily, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.29'>And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, having great debating with each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>And Paul continued two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things that relate to the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom of speech, no man forbidding him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>who was of the seed of David, according to the flesh, But declared the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>God forbid: let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is not God unjust, who taketh vengeance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>I speak as a man. God forbid; for then how should God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>But if the truth of God hath abounded to his glory through my lie, why am I still judged as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>And why may we not (as we are slandered, and as some affirm us to say) do evil, that good may come? Whose damnation is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? Are we better than they? In no wise: for we have before proved all, both Jews and Gentiles, to be under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>There is none that understandeth; there is none that seeketh after God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>They have all turned aside; they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doth good, no not one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues have they used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>Destruction and misery are in their ways,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>The fear of God is not before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know that whatsoever the law saith, it saith to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world be found guilty before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Therefore no flesh shall be justified in his sight by the works of the law; for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But the righteousness of God without the law is now manifested, being attested by the law and the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>Even the righteousness of God, by the faith of Jesus Christ, to all and upon all that believe; for there is no difference:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>For all have sinned, and are fallen short of the glory of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>And are justified freely by his grace, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>Whom God hath set forth as a propitiation, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness by the remission of past sins, through the forbearance of God: For a demonstration,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>I say, of his righteousness in this present time, that he might be just, and yet the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>Nay, but by the law of faith. We conclude then, that a man is justified by faith, without the works of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Is God the God of the Jews only, and not also of the Gentiles? Surely of the Gentiles also: Seeing it is one God who will justify the circumcision by faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>and the uncircumcision through the same faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What shall we say then? That our father Abraham hath found according to the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>If Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory: but he hath not in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is imputed to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>So David also describeth the happiness of the man, to whom God imputeth righteousness without works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>Happy are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>Happy is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Cometh this happiness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? For we say that faith was imputed to Abraham for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How was it then imputed? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith, which he had in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all who believe in uncircumcision, that righteousness may be imputed to them also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>And the father of the circumcision, to them who not only are of the circumcision, but also walk in the footsteps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham or to his seed by the law, but by the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if they who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be of grace, that the promise might be firm to all the seed; not only to that which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, (As it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>I have made thee a father of many nations) before God in whom he believed, as quickning the dead, and calling the things that are not, as though they were:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>Who against hope believed in hope, that he should be the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>And not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, being about an hundred years old, nor the deadness of Sarah's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>And being fully assured, that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now it was not written on his account only, that it was imputed to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>But on ours also, to whom it will be imputed, if we believe on him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>By whom also we have been introduced through faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>knowing that tribulation worketh patience, And patience experience, and experience hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>And hope shameth us not, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>For when we were yet without strength, in due time, Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>Now one will scarce die for a just man: yet perhaps for the good man one would even dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God recommendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Much more then being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved through his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only so, but we also glory in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Therefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin, even so death passed upon all men, in that all had sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed, where there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>Yet not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if by the offence of one many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, that of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And not as the loss by one that sinned, so is the gift; for the sentence was by one offence to condemnation; but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if through one man's offence death reigned by one, they who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness, shall much more reign in life, by one, even Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>As therefore by one offence the sentence of death came upon all men to condemnation, so also by one righteousness the free gift came upon all men to justification of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For as by the disobedience of one man, many were constituted sinners, so by the obedience of one, many shall be constituted righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>But the law came in between, that the offence might abound: yet where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>That as sin had reigned through death, so grace also might reign through righteousness to eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What shall we say then? We will continue in sin that grace may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>God forbid. How shall we who are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Know ye not, that as many of us have been baptized into Jesus Christ, have been baptized into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death, that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we might no longer serve sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For he that is dead is freed from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>And we believe, that if we are dead with Christ, we shall also live with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>For in that he died, he died to sin once for all; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>So reckon ye also yourselves to be dead to sin, and alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Therefore let not sin reign in your mortal body, to obey it in the desires thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>Neither present your members to sin, as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members to God, as instruments of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>For sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are whom ye obey? Whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were the servants of sin, ye have now obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine into which ye have been delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>Being then set free from sin, ye are become the servants of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>I speak as a man, because of the weakness of your flesh. As ye have presented your members servants to uncleanness and iniquity, unto iniquity, so now present your members servants of righteousness, unto holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>What fruit had ye then from those things whereof ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law) that the law hath dominion over a man, as long as it liveth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For the married woman is bound to her husband while he is alive; but if her husband be dead, she is freed from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>Therefore if she marry another man while her husband liveth, she will be called an adultress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law, so as to be no adultress, though she marry another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>Thus ye also, my brethren, are dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye might be married to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For when we were in the flesh, sinful passions, which were by the law, wrought in our members, so as to bring forth fruit unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now we are freed from the law, that whereby we were held being dead, so that we serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What shall we say then? That the law is sin? God forbid. Yea, I should not have known sin, but for the law. I had not known lust, unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>But sin taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of desire: for without the law sin was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>And I was once alive without the law; but when the commandment came,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>sin revived, and I died, And the commandment, which was intended for life, this I found unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Was then that which is good made death to me? God forbid: But sin: so that it appeared sin, working death in me by that which is good: so that sin might by the commandment become exceeding sinful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For that which I do I approve not; for what I would, I do not, but what I hate, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>If then I do what I would not, I consent to the law, that it is good.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but how to perform what is good, I find not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>Now, if I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I delight in the law of God, after the inward man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and captivating me to the law of sin, which is in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>Wretched man that I am!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I myself with my mind serve the law of God, but with my flesh the law of sin.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>Therefore there is now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath freed me from the law of sin and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God hath done: sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, to be a sacrifice for sin, he hath condemned sin in the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>They that are after the flesh, mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>Now to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>So then they who are in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if the Spirit of God dwell in you. And if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>Now if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead, will also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again unto fear, but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ: if we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by him who subjected it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>In hope that the creation itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>For we know that the whole creation groaneth together and travaileth together until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not only they, but even we ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.1'>I say the truth in Christ, I lie not; my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.2'>That I have great sorrow and continual anguish in my heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.3'>For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ, for my brethren, my kinsmen after the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.4'>Who are Israelites, whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the worship of God, and the promises:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.5'>Whose are the fathers, and from whom, according to the flesh, Christ came, who is, over all, God, blessed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.6'>Not as if the word of God had fallen to the ground; for all are not Israel, who are of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.7'>Neither because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children, but in Isaac shall thy seed be called:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.8'>That is, not the children of the flesh are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.9'>For this is the word of the promise, At this time I will come, and Sarah shall have a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.10'>And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.11'>our father Isaac, The children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil (that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works, but of him that called,) It was said to her, The elder shall serve the younger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.12'>As it is written, I have loved Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.13'>and hated Esau.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.14'>What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.15'>For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.16'>It is not therefore of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.17'>Moreover the scripture saith to Pharoah, For this very thing have I raised thee up, that I may shew my power in thee, and that my name may be declared through all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.18'>So then he hath mercy on whom he willeth, and whom he willeth, he hardneth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.19'>But thou wilt say to me, Why doth he still find fault?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.20'>For who hath resisted his will? Nay, but who art thou, O man, that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.21'>Hath not the potter power over the clay, out of the same mass to make one vessel to honour, and another to dishonour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.22'>What if God, being willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, yet endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.23'>And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, whom he had before prepared for glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.24'>Even us whom he hath called, not only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.25'>As he saith also in Hosea, I will call them my people, who were not my people, and her beloved, who was not beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.26'>And it shall come to pass, in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not my people, there shall they be called the sons of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.27'>Isaiah likewise crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant only shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.28'>For the Lord is finishing and cutting short his account in righteousness; for the Lord will make a short account upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.29'>And as Isaiah had said before, Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and had been made like Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.30'>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles who followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.31'>But Israel following after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.32'>Wherefore? Because they sought it, not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law: for they stumbled at that stumbling stone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.33'>As it is written, Behold I lay in Sion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence: and every one that believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.1'>Brethren, the desire of my heart, and my prayer to God for Israel is, that they may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.2'>For I bear them record, that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.3'>For they being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.4'>For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.5'>For Moses describeth the righteousness which is by the law, The man who doth these things shall live by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.6'>But the righteousness which is by faith speaketh thus: Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven, (that is, to bring Christ down:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.7'>Or who shall descend into the deep?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.8'>(that is, to bring Christ again from the dead) But what saith he? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is, the word of faith which we preach:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.9'>That if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thy heart, that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.10'>For with the heart man believeth to righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made to salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.11'>For the scripture saith, Every one that believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.12'>For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord of all, is rich to all that call upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.13'>For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.14'>But how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.15'>But how shall they preach, unless they be sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them who bring the good tidings of peace, who bring the glad tidings of good things!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.16'>But all have not obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.17'>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.18'>But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily; their voice is gone into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.19'>But I say, Hath not Israel known? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are not a nation; by a foolish nation I will anger you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.20'>But Isaiah is very bold and saith, I was found by them that sought me not: I was made manifest to them that asked not after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.21'>Whereas with regard to Israel he saith, All the day have I stretched forth my hands to an unbelieving and gainsaying people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.1'>I say then, Hath God rejected his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.2'>God hath not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.3'>Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thy altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.4'>But what saith the answer of God to him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.5'>And so likewise at the present time, there is a remnant, according to the election of grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.6'>But if by grace, then it is no more of works: else grace is no longer grace. And if it be of works, then it is no more grace; else work is no longer work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.7'>What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh, but the election hath obtained, and the rest were blinded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.8'>According as it is written, God hath given them a spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.9'>And David saith, Let their table become a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompence to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.10'>Let their eyes be darkened that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.11'>I say then, Have they stumbled so as to fall? God forbid. But by their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.12'>But if their fall be the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.13'>For I speak to you Gentiles, as I am the apostle of the Gentiles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.14'>I magnify my office: If by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and save some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.15'>For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what will the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.16'>For if the first-fruits be holy, so is the lump: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.17'>And if some of the branches were broken off, and thou being a wild olive wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the good olive,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.18'>Boast not against the branches, but if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.19'>Wilt thou say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>Well; they were broken off for unbelief, and thou standest by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>Be not high-minded, but fear. For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed left he also spare not thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God! Toward them that fell severity; but toward thee goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: else shalt thou also be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>And they also, if they do not continue in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>For if thou wert cut off from the naturally wild olive-tree, and grafted contrary to nature into a good olive-tree; how much more shall these, who are natural branches, be grafted into their own olive-tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>Brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, (lest ye should be wise in your own conceits) that hardness is in part happened to Israel, till the fulness of the Gentiles be come in:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written, The deliverer shall come out of Sion, and shall turn away iniquity from Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>And this is my covenant with them, when I shall take away their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>With regard to the gospel, they are enemies for your sake; but as for the election, they are beloved, for the sake of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>As then ye were once disobedient to God, but have now obtained mercy through their disobedience:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>So these also have now been disobedient, that through your mercy they may likewise find mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>For God hath shut up all together in disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>O the depth of the riches, and wisdom, and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.34'>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his counsellor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.35'>Who hath first given to him, and it shall be repaid him again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.36'>For of him, and through him, and to him are all things: to him be glory for ever! Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly to you, in part, as putting you in mind, because of the grace which is given to me of God,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>For I will not dare to speak of any thing which Christ hath not done by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, Through mighty signs and wonders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>by the power of the Spirit, so that I have fully preached the Gospel of Christ, from Jerusalem round about, as far as Illyricum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>But I have striven, so to preach the gospel, not where Christ had been named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>But as it is written, They to whom he was not spoken of shall see; and they that have not heard, shall understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>Therefore I have been long hindered from coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>But now having no longer place in these parts, and having had a great desire for many years to come to you, Whenever I go into Spain, I will come to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>for I hope to see you as I pass by, and to be brought forward by you in my way thither, if first I may be somewhat satisfied with your company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>But I am now going to Jerusalem, serving the saints. For it hath</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a collection for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>It hath pleased them, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have partook of their spiritual things, they ought to minister to them in carnal things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>When therefore I have performed this, and sealed to them this fruit, I will go by you into Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>And I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>in your prayers to God for me, That I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service at Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints:</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you, but that ye be perfectly joined together, in the same mind and in the same judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it hath been declared to me of you, my brethren, by them of the family of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the doctrine of the cross is indeed to them that perish foolishness; but to us who are saved, it is the power of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>Yet we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: but not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, that come to nought: But we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>Which none of the rulers of this world knew; for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man which is in him? So the things of God also knoweth no one, but the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things which are freely given to us of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>Which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Holy Spirit, explaining spiritual things by spiritual words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit; for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But the spiritual man discerneth all things, while he himself is discerned by no man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If any one's work shall be burnt, he shall suffer loss, but himself shall be saved, yet so as through the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Know ye not, that ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If any man destroy the temple of God, him shall God destroy: for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But it is a very small thing with me, to be judged by you or by any man's judgment; yea, I judge not myself.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>These things, brethren, I have by a figure transferred to myself and Apollos, for your sakes; that ye may learn in us, not to think of men above what is here written, that ye may not be puffed up for one above another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who maketh thee to differ from another? And what hast thou which thou hast not received? But if thou hast received it, why dost thou boast, as if thou hadst not received it?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.18'>For first, when ye come together in the church, I hear there are schisms among you, (and I partly believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.19'>For there must be heresies also among you, that the approved among you may be manifest).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.20'>Therefore when ye come together into one place, it is not eating the Lord's supper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.21'>For in eating every one taketh before another his own supper, and one is hungry, another drinks largely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.22'>What! have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or do ye despise the church of God, and shame them that have not? what shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.23'>I praise you not. For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus the night in which he was betrayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.24'>took bread, And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat, this is my body, which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.25'>In like manner also he took the cup after he had supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: do this as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.26'>Therefore as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye shew forth the Lord's death, till he come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.27'>So that whosoever shall eat the bread and drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.28'>Therefore let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.29'>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not distinguishing the Lord's body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.30'>For this cause many are sick and weak among you, and many sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.31'>For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.32'>But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.33'>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.34'>And if any one be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye come not together to condemnation. And the rest I will set in order when I come.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.1'>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.2'>Ye know that when ye were heathens, ye were carried away after dumb idols, as ye were led.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.3'>Therefore I give you to know, that as no one speaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jesus accursed; so no one can say, Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.4'>Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.5'>And there are diversities of administrations, but the same Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.6'>And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God who worketh all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.7'>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each, to profit withal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.8'>For to one is given by the Spirit, the word of wisdom; to another by the same Spirit, the word of knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.9'>To another faith by the same Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.10'>to another the gift of healing by the same Spirit; To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another the discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.11'>But one and the same Spirit worketh all these, dividing to every one severally as he willeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.12'>For as the body is one, and yet hath many members, but all the members of the body, many as they are, are one body, so is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.13'>For we are all baptized by one Spirit into one body, whether we are Jews or Gentiles, whether slaves or freemen; and we have all drank of one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.14'>For the body is not one member, but many. If the foot should say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.15'>Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.16'>And if the ear should say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.17'>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.18'>But now hath God set the members, every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.19'>And if all were one member, where were the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>Whereas now there are indeed many members, yet but one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee; or again, the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>Yea, the members of the body, which appear to be weaker, are much more necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>And those which we think to be the less honourable parts of the body, these we surround with more abundant honour, and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>For our comely parts have no need; but God hath tempered the body together, giving more abundant honour to that which lacked:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>That there might be no schism in the body, but that the members might have the same care for each other:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>And whether one member suffer, all the members might suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members might rejoice with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>And God hath set in the church, first, apostles, secondly, prophets, thirdly, teachers: afterward miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, different kinds of tongues.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>And when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall vanish away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I talked as a child, I understood as a child, I reasoned as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Follow after love: and desire spiritual gifts; but especially that ye may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue, speaketh not to men, but to God; for no one understandeth him, though by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>Whereas he that prophesieth, speaketh to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He that speaketh in an unknown tongue, edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied; for he that prophesieth, is greater than he that speaketh with tongues, unless he interpret, that the church may receive edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you, either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophecy, or by doctrine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>So inanimate things which give a sound, whether pipe or harp, unless they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>And if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for the battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>So likewise unless ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? For ye will speak to the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>Let there be ever so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them without signification:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>Yet if I know not the meaning of the language, I shall be a barbarian to him that speaketh, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>So ye also, seeing ye desire spiritual gifts, seek to abound in them, to the edifying of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Therefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my Spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What then is my duty? I will pray with the Spirit; but I will pray with the understanding also; I will sing with the Spirit; but I will sing with the understanding also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>Otherwise if thou givest thanks with the Spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of a private person, say Amen to thy thanksgiving, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank God, that I speak with tongues more than you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>Yet in the congregation I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brethren, be not children in understanding: in wickedness be ye as infants, but in understanding be ye grown men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>It is written in the law, In foreign tongues and with foreign lips will I speak to this people; and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>So that tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; whereas prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>Yet if the whole church be met together, and all speak with unknown tongues, and there come in ignorant persons or unbelievers, will they not say, that ye are mad?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>The secrets of his heart are made manifest, and so falling down on his face, he will worship God, and declare that God is among you of a truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What a thing is it, brethren, that when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>Let all things be done to edification. If any one speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two or three at most, and that by course, and let one interpret.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Let two or three of the prophets speak, and let the rest judge. But if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>let the first be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>For the Spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>Let your women be silent in the churches; for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be in subjection, as the law also saith.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother, to the church of God that is in Corinth, with all the saints that are in all Achaia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Grace and peace be to you from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and God of all comfort,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>Who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any affliction, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our comfort also aboundeth through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>And whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effectual in the patient enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>And our hope concerning you is stedfast, knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, of the trouble which befell us in Asia, that we were exceedingly pressed, above our strength, so that we despaired even of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>Yea, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we might not trust in ourselves, but in God, who raiseth the dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust, that he will still deliver:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>You likewise helping together with us by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For this is our rejoicing, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with carnal wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more especially toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we write no other things to you, but what ye know and acknowledge, and I trust will acknowledge even to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, as ye also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that ye might have had a second benefit, And to pass by you into Macedonia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>and to come to you again from Macedonia, and to be brought forward by you in my way toward Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>Now when I was thus minded, did I use levity? or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that there should be with me yea and nay?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>As God is faithful, our word to you hath not been yea and nay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For Jesus Christ the Son of God, who was preached among you by us, by me, and Silvanus, and Timotheus was not yea and nay; but was yea in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>For he that establisheth us with you in Christ, and that hath anointed us is God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>Who hath also sealed us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>But I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you, I came not as yet to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy; for by faith ye have stood.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>But I determined this with myself not to come to you again in grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I grieve you, who is he that cheareth me, but he that is grieved by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I wrote thus to you, that I might not when I come have grief from those for whom I ought to rejoice; being persuaded concerning you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For from much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that ye might be grieved, but that ye might know the abundant love which I have toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>And if any have caused grief, he hath grieved me but in part, that I may not overburden you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>Sufficient for such an one is this punishment inflicted by many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>So that on the contrary ye should rather forgive and comfort him, lest such an one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>I beseech you therefore to confirm your love toward him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye were obedient in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: and if I forgive any thing, to whom I forgive it, it is for your sakes, in the person of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>Lest Satan get an advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Now when I came to Troas, to preach the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; so taking leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>Now thanks be to God, who causeth us always to triumph through Christ, and manifesteth by us in every place the odour of his knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>For we are to God a sweet odour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>To these an odour of death unto death, but to those an odour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we are not as many, who adulterate the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Do we again begin to recommend ourselves? Unless we need, as some do, recommendatory letters to you, or recommendatory letters from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>Ye are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by all men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>Manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>Such trust have we in God through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to think any thing as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>Who also hath made us able ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>And if the ministration of death engraven in letters on stones was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly on the face of Moses, because of the glory of his face, which was to be abolished: Shall not rather the ministration of the Spirit be glorious?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>For if the ministration of condemnation was glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For even that which was made glorious, had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that excelleth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if that which is abolished was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Having therefore this hope, we use great plainness of speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>And not as Moses, who put a veil upon his face, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly to the end of that which is abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>But their understandings were blinded: and until this day the same veil remaineth unremoved on the reading of the old testament, which is taken away in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But the veil lieth on their heart when Moses is read until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>And we all with unveiled face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Therefore having this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not: But have renounced the hidden things of shame,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>not walking in craftiness, nor deceitfully corrupting the word of God, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>But if our gospel also is veiled, it is veiled to them that perish;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>Whose unbelieving minds the god of this world hath blinded, lest the illumination of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to inlighten us with the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God, and not of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>We are troubled on every side, yet not crushed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>perplexed, but not in despair; Persecuted, but not forsaken; thrown down, but not destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>We who live are always delivered unto death for the sake of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So then death worketh in us, but life in you. Yet having the same spirit of faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>according to what is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken, we also believe, and therefore speak:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>Knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus, will also raise us up by Jesus, and present us with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For all things are for your sakes, that the overflowing grace might through the thanksgiving of many abound to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>Therefore we faint not, but even though the outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>While we aim not at the things that are seen, but the things that are not seen: for the things that are seen are temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon, with our house which is from heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>If being clothed, we shall not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For we who are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened; not that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>Now he that hath wrought us to this very thing is God, who hath also given us the earnest of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>Therefore we always behave undauntedly; knowing that while we are sojourning in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>(For we walk by faith, not by sight.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>We behave undauntedly, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Therefore we are ambitious, whether present, or absent, to be well-pleasing to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive according to what he hath done in the body, whether good or evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men: but we are made manifest to God, and I trust we are made manifest in your consciences also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>We do not again recommend ourselves to you; but we give you an occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have something to answer them, who glory in appearance, and not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For if we are transported beyond ourselves, it is to God; if we are sober, it is for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of Christ constraineth us, while we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>And that he died for all, that they who live should not henceforth live to themselves, but to him who died for them, and rose again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>So that we from this time know no one after the flesh; yea, if we have known even Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>Therefore if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation: the old things are passed way; behold, all things are become new:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>And all things are from God, who hath reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation: Namely,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their traspasses to them, and hath committed to us the word of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>Therefore we are embassadors for Christ, as though God were intreating by us: we beseech you, in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>For he hath made him, who knew no sin, a sin-offering for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God through him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed, But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>Therefore we were comforted in your comfort, and we rejoiced the more exceedingly in the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>So that if I had boasted any thing of you to him, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, so also our boasting to Titus is found a truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And his tender affection is more abundant toward you, calling to mind the obedience of you all, how ye received him with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>I rejoice therefore, that I have confidence in you in all things.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>Moreover, brethren, we declare to you the grace of God, bestowed on the churches in Macedonia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>That in a great trial of affliction, their overflowing joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>That to their power, I testify, and beyond their power, they were willing of themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>Praying us with much intreaty, to receive the gift and take a part in ministring it to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>And this they did, not as we hoped; but first gave themselves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also compleat this gift among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>Therefore as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I speak not by way of command, but that by the diligence of others, I may prove the sincerity of your love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun a year ago, not only to do, but also to do it willingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>Now therefore compleat the work, that as there was a ready will, so there may be also a performance, in proportion to what ye have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if there be first a ready mind, a man is accepted, according to what he hath, not according to what he hath not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>For I do not mean, that others should be eased, and you burthened; But by an equality,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>let your abundance be at this time a supply to their want; that their abundance also may be a supply to your want, that there may be an equality,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>As it is written, He that had gathered the most, had nothing over; and he that had gathered the least, did not lack.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>But thanks be to God, who put the same diligent care for you in the heart of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>For he accepted indeed the exhortation, but being more forward, he went to you of his own accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise in the gospel is through all the churches: (And not only so,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>but he was also appointed by the churches to be a fellow-traveller with us, with this gift, which is administred by us, to the glory of the Lord himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>and for the declaration of our ready mind) Avoiding this, lest any one should blame us in this abundance, which is administred by us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>For we provide things honest, not only before the Lord, but also before men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, through his great confidence in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>If any inquire concerning Titus, he is my partner, and fellow-labourer with respect to you; or concerning our brethren, they are the messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Shew therefore to them before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>For concerning the ministring to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>For I know your readiness, which I boast concerning you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>Yet I have sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you on this head should be made vain, that, as I said, ye may be ready;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>Lest if any of the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say, you) be ashamed of this confident boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>Therefore I thought it necessary, to desire the brethren to go before to you, and compleat this your bounty, which had been spoken of before, that it may be ready as a bounty, and not as a matter of covetousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>And this I say, He that soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully, shall reap also bountifully:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>Let every man do as he chuseth in his heart, not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a chearful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that having always all sufficiency in all things, ye may abound to every good work:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>(As it is written, He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness remaineth for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>And may he who supplieth seed to the sower, and bread for your food, supply and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:)</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>Destroying reasonings, and every high thing which exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>And being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, now your obedience is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>Do ye look at the outward appearance of things? If any man be confident, that he is Christ's, let him again think this of himself, that as he is Christ's, so we also are Christ's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>Yea, if I should boast something more also of the authority which the Lord hath given us, for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>That I may not seem to terrify you by letters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>For his letters indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>Let such an one think this, that such as we are in word by letters, when we are absent, such are we also in deed, when we are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>For we presume not to equal or to compare ourselves with some of those who recommend themselves: but they among themselves limiting themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not wise.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>yet still within our province, abundantly, So as to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, not to boast in another's province of things made ready to our hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>I went up by revelation, and explained to them the gospel, which I preach among the Gentiles; but severally to those of eminence, lest by any means I should run, or should have run in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>(But neither was Titus, who was with me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>being a Greek, compelled to be circumcised, Because of false brethren introduced unawares, who came in privily, to spy out our liberty which we have through Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>To whom we did not yield by submission, no, not an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>And they who undoubtedly were something, (but whatsoever they were, it is no difference to me; God accepteth no man's person) they who undoubtedly were something in conference, added nothing to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>But on the contrary, when they saw that I was intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, as Peter with that of the circumcision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, wrought likewise effectually in me toward the Gentiles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>) And when James, and Cephas, and John, who undoubtedly were pillars, knew the grace that was given to me, they gave the right-hands of fellowships to me and Barnabas, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision: Only they desired that we would be mindful of the poor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>the same which I also was forward to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>For before certain men came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>And the other Jews also dissembled with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw, that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, If thou being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to judaize?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We who are Jews by nature,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>and not sinners of the Gentiles, Even we (knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ) have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law; because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>But if while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ therefore the minister of sin?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>God forbid. For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For I through the law am dead to the law, that I may live to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>I am crucified with Christ, and I live no longer, but Christ liveth in me, and the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not make void the grace of God; for if righteousness is by the law, then Christ died in vain.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O thoughtless Galatians, who hath bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>This only would I learn of you, Did you receive the Spirit, by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are ye so thoughtless? Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>Have ye suffered so many things in vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>If it be yet in vain? Doth he that ministreth the Spirit to you, and worketh miracles among you, do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>As Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>Know then, that they who are of faith, these are the sons of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>And the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, declared before the glad tidings to Abraham, In thee shall all the nations be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>So then they who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>Now the law is not of faith; but the man that doeth them, shall live by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: (for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>) That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>I speak after the manner of men: though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, none disannulleth or addeth thereto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>And this I say, the covenant which was before confirmed of God through Christ, the law which was four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>For if the inheritance be by the law, it is no more by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Wherefore then was the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made: and it was ordained by angels, in the hand of a mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>Now the mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Is then the law against the promises of God? God forbid. But if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness would have been by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up together unto the faith which was to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>Wherefore the law was our school-master unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But faith being come, we are no longer under a school-master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>For ye are all sons of God by faith in Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>So we also, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance to you, that it was not in vain: But even after we had suffered before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>and had been shamefully intreated at Philippi, as ye know, we were bold thro' our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation is not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>But as we have been approved of God to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who trieth our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness: God is witness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>Nor sought we glory of men, neither from you, nor from others, when we might have been burdensome, as the Apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we were gentle in the midst of you, even as a nurse cherisheth her own children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>So, loving you tenderly, we were ready to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but our own souls also, because ye were dear to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For ye remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>Ye are witnesses and God, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved among you that believe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>As ye know how we exhorted and comforted every one of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>as a father his own children, And charged you to walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, even because when ye received the word of God from us, ye received it, not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, who likewise effectually worketh in you that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God in Christ Jesus, which are in Judea; for ye also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, as they likewise from the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>Who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us: and they please not God, and are contrary to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: but wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time, in presence, not in heart, laboured with great desire the more abundantly to see your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>Wherefore we would have come to you (even I Paul) once and again, but Satan hindered us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake of old to the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken to us by his Son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>Whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom he also made the worlds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and sustaining all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>Being made so much higher than the angels, as he hath by inheritance a more excellent name than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the angels did he ever say, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>And again, When he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>But unto the Son, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of righteousness:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation, which began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that had heard him?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. Now in putting all things in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him: but now we do not yet see all things put under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>But we see Jesus crowned with glory and honour, for the suffering of death, who was made a little lower than the angels, that by the grace of God he might taste death for every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the captain of their salvation through sufferings.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>Where your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>Therefore I was grieved with that generation and said, They always err in their hearts, and they have not know my ways.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>For we that have believed, do enter into the rest; as he said, I have sworn in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest, though the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For he saith thus in a certain place, of the seventh day , And God rested on the seventh day from all his works: And in this again, They shall not enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>Seeing then it remaineth that some enter into it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>and they to whom the gospel was preached before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>entered not in because of unbelief, He again, after so long a time, fixeth a certain day, saying by David, To-day; as it was said before, To day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Joshua had given them the rest, he would not have afterward spoken of another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>There remaineth therefore a rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For he that hath entered into his rest, hath himself also ceased from his works, as God did from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Let us labour, therefore, to enter into that rest, lest any one should fall, after the same example of unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder both of the soul and spirit, both of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Having therefore a great high priest, that is passed thro' the heavens, Jesus the son of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>let us hold fast our profession, For we have not an high-priest who cannot sympathize with our infirmities, but who was in all points tempted like as we are: yet without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>Who can have compassion on the ignorant and the wandering, seeing he himself also is compassed with infirmity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>And because hereof it behoveth him, as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And no one taketh this honour to himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest, but he that said to him , Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedeck:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, unto him that was able to save him from death, and being heard from his fears; Tho' he was a son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered, And being perfected,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>became the author of eternal salvation to all that obey him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>and of faith in God, Of the doctrine of baptisms and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And this we will do, if God permit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossible for those who were once inlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and been made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>And have fallen away, to renew them again unto repentance, seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh often upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whom it is tilled, receiveth blessing from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>But that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected and nigh unto a curse, whose end is to be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not unrighteous, to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>But we desire that every one of you would shew unto the end the same diligence, to the full assurance of hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>That ye be not slothful, but followers of them, who through faith and long suffering inherited the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when God made the promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>he swore by himself, Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For men verily swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all contradiction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>Wherefore God being willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his counsel, interposed by an oath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>That by two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled to lay hold on the hope set before us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>Whither Jesus our fore-runner is entered for us, made an high-priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchisedek king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all the spoils; being by interpretation, first king of righteousness, and then king of Salem also, which is king of peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>Without father, without mother, without pedigree, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but being made like the son of God, remaineth a priest continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And verily they of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment (according to the law) to take tithes of the people, that is, of their brethren, tho' they come out of the loins of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But he whose pedigree is not from them, took tythes of Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>And without all contradiction, the less is blessed of the greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>And here men that die receive tithes: but there, he of whom it is witnessed, that he liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>And even Levi, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes (so to speak) thro' Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedek met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>If then perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law) what farther need was there that another priest should rise, after the order of Melchisedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For the priesthood being changed, there is also necessarily a change of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For he of whom these things are spoken, pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man attended on the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is evident, that our Lord sprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning the priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And it is still far more evident, because another priest is raised up, after the likeness of Melchidek, Who was made not after the law of a carnal commandment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>but after the power of an endless life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For it is testified, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>For verily there is a disannulling of the preceding commandment, for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did, by which we draw nigh to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And in as much as not without an oath he was made priest: (For those priests were made without an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>but this with an oath, by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedek:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>Of so much better a covenant was Jesus made a surety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>And they truly were many priests, because they were hindered by death from continuing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>But this, because he continueth for ever, hath a priesthood that passeth not away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Wherefore he is able also, to save them to the uttermost who come to God thro' him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For such an high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, then for those of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the law maketh men high priests that have infirmity; but the word of the oath which was since the law, maketh the son, who is consecrated for evermore.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>The sum of what hath been spoken is, We have such an high priest, who is set down at the right-hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>A minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath fixed and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is ordained to offer up gifts and sacrifices; whence it was necessary, that this also should have somewhat to offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, there being priests that offer gifts, according to the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>Who serve after the pattern and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God, when he was about to make the tabernacle; for, saith he, See thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewed thee on the mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>And now he hath obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much better a covenant he is a mediator of, which is established upon better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if the first had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For finding fault with them he saith, Behold the days come, saith the Lord, when I will finish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand, to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>For this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws in their minds, and write them on their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And they shall not teach every one his neighbour, and every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least to the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>In saying, a new covenant, he hath antiquated the first; now that which is antiquated and decayed, is ready to vanish away.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>And verily the first covenant also had ordinances of worship and a worldly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first, in which was the candlestick, and the table, and the shew-bread; which is called The holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>And after the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called The holy of holies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>Having the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, overlaid round about with gold, wherein was a golden pot having the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>And over it were the Cherubim of glory, shadowing the mercy-seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Now these things being thus prepared, the priests go always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing their services.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>But into the second, only the high-priest once a year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself and the errors of the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>The Holy Ghost evidently shewing this, that the way into the holiest was not yet made manifest, while the first tabernacle was still subsisting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, which could not perfect the worshiper as to his conscience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>Only with meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed till the time of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But Christ being come, an high-priest of good things to come, through a greater and more perfect tabernacle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>not made with hands, that is, not of this building, And not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And for this end he is the Mediator of a new covenant, that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, they who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where a testament is, there must also necessarily be the death of the testator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For a testament is of force after men are dead; otherwise it is of no strength while the testator liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Whence neither was the first testament consecrated without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For when Moses had spoken all the commandment according to the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wooll, and hyssop, and the book itself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>and sprinkled all the people, Saying, This is the blood of the testament, which God hath enjoined unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>And in like manner he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>And almost all things are according to the law purified with blood, and withoutshedding of blood there is no remission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>It was therefore necessary, that the patterns of things in heaven should be purified by these, but the heavenly things themselves by better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For Christ did not enter into the holy place made with hands, the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Nor did he enter, that he might offer himself often (as the high-priest entered into the holy place every year with the blood of others.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>For then he must often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the consummation of the ages hath he been manifested, to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And as it is appointed for men once to die, and after this the judgment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>So Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, will appear the second time, without sin, to them that look for him, unto salvation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For the law having a shadow of good things to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices which they offer year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>Otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered? Because the worshipers, having been once purged, would have had no more consciousness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But in those sacrifices, there is a commemoration of sins every year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For it is impossible, that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>Therefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou hast not chosen, but a body hast thou prepared for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>Burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast not delighted in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then I said, Lo I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering, and burnt-offerings and offering for sin thou hast not chosen, neither delighted in, which are offered by the law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>Then said he, Lo, I come, to do thy will. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>By which will we are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And every priest standeth daily ministring and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But he having offered one sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>for ever sat down at the right hand of God, From thenceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>And this the Holy Ghost also witnesseth to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>for after he had said before, This is the covenant which I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws into their hearts, and write them in their minds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>And their sins, and their iniquities will I remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Having therefore, brethren, free liberty to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us through the veil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>that is, his flesh, And having an high-priest over the house of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering (for he is faithful that hath promised) And let us consider one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>to provoke one another to love and to good works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>Not forsaking the assembling ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another, and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For when we sin wilfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which will devour the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>He that despised the law of Moses died without mercy, under two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and counted the blood of the covenant, by which he hath been sanctified, an unholy thing, and done despite to the spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>For we know him that hath said, Vengeance is mine; I will recompence: and again, The Lord will judge his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>But call ye to mind the former days, in which, after ye were inlightened, ye endured so great a conflict of sufferings:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>Partly being made a gazing-stock both by reproaches and afflictions; partly being partakers with them who were so used.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For ye sympathized with my bonds, and received with joy the spoiling of your goods, knowing that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>For yet a little while, and he that cometh will come and will not tarry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>Now the just shall live by faith; but if he draw back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'>But we are not of them who draw back to perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.11'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Now faith is the subsistence of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>And by it the elders obtained a good testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were made of things which do not appear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained a testimony that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and by it, being dead he yet speaketh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>By faith Enoch was translated so as not to see death, and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>But without faith it is impossible to please him; for he that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his houshold, by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>By faith Abraham, being called to go out into the place which he was to receive for an inheritance, obeyed and went out, not knowing whither he went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the joint heirs of the same promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'>For he looked for the city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'>By faith Sarah also herself received power to conceive seed, even when she was past age, because she accounted him faithful who had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'>Therefore there sprang even from one, and him as it were dead, as the stars of heaven for multitude, and as the sand which is on the sea-shore innumerable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.13'>All these died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and embraced them, and confest that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'>For they who speak thus, shew plainly, that they seek their own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.15'>And truly if they had been mindful of that from which they came out, they might have had opportunity to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.16'>But they now desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared a city for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.17'>By faith Abraham, being tried, offered up Isaac, and he that had received the promises, offered up his only begotten son:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.18'>Of whom it had been said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.19'>Accounting that God was able even to raise him from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.20'>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, concerning things to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.21'>By Faith Jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.22'>By faith Joseph, when dying, made mention of the children of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.23'>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months, by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.24'>By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.25'>Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.26'>Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he looked off unto the recompence of reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.27'>By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing him that is invisible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.28'>By faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the first born should touch them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>And be always ready to give an answer to every one that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>Having a good conscience, that whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>For Christ also once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>For to this end was the gospel preached to them that are dead also, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>But the end of all things is at hand; be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>And above all things, have fervent love to each other; for love will cover a multitude of sins.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved, wonder not at the burning which is among you, which is for your trial, as if some strange thing befell you: But as ye partake of the sufferings of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>rejoice, that when his glory shall be revealed, ye may likewise rejoice with exceeding great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil-spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a meddler in other mens matters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>Yet if any suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>But, beloved, be not ye ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>The Lord is not slow concerning his promise (tho' some men count it slowness) but is long-suffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth, and the works that are therein, shall be burnt up.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>Nevertheless we look for new heavens and a new earth, according to his promise, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>Wherefore, beloved, seeing ye look for these things, labour to be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>And account the long-suffering of our Lord salvation, as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given him , hath written to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>As also in all his epistles, speaking therein of these things, in which are some things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>Ye, therefore, beloved, knowing these things before, beware, lest ye also being led away by the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity! Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as the voice of thunder, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I saw, and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And there went forth another horse that was red; and to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth, that they should kill one another; and there was given him a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come. And I saw, and behold a black horse, and he that sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and hurt not the oil and the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And I saw and behold a pale horse, and he that sat on him, his name was Death, (and Hades followeth even with him) and power was given him over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the scimetar, and with famine, and with death, and by the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, thou Holy One and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And there was given to them, to every one, a white robe; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a time, till their fellow servants also and their brethren should be fulfilled, who should be killed even as they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, and the sun was black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon was as blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig-tree casteth its untimely figs, when it is shaken by a mighty wind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>And the heaven departed as a book that is rolled together, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>And the kings of the earth, and the chief captains, and the rich, and the mighty, and every slave, and every free man hid themselves in the caves, and in the rocks of the mountains:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>And said to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and cover us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>And after this I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds, that the wind should not blow upon the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>Saying, Hurt ye not the earth, neither the sea, neither the trees, till we seal the servants of our God on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>And I heard the number of them that were sealed; an hundred forty four thousand were sealed out of all the tribes of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.6'>Of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Napthali were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.7.9'>After this I saw, and behold a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and tribes, and people, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes and palms in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.10'>And they cry with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sitteth on the throne and to the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.11'>And all the angels stood round about the throne and the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God saying, Amen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.12'>the blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom, and the thanksgiving, and the honour, and the power, and the strength, be to our God for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.13'>And one of the elders answered, saying to me, Who are these that are cloathed in white robes? and whence are they come? And I said to him, My lord, thou knowest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.14'>And he said to me, These are they who come out of great affliction, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.15'>Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple, and he that sitteth upon the throne shall have his tent over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.16'>They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.17'>For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will feed them, and will lead them to living fountains of water: and God will wipe away all tears from their eyes.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.1'>And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about half an hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.2'>And I saw the seven angels which stand before God, and seven trumpets were given them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.3'>And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given him, that he might place it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which is before the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.4'>And the smoke of the incense came up before God out of the angels hand with the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.5'>And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it upon the earth, and there were thunderings, and lightnings, and voices, and an earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.6'>And the seven angels, who had the seven trumpets, prepared themselves to sound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.7'>And the first sounded, and there was hail, and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all the green grass was burnt up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.8'>And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire, was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.9'>And the third part of the creatures that were in the sea which had life died, and the third part of the ships was destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.10'>And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star burning as a lamp, and it fell on the third part of the rivers, and on the fountains of waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.11'>And the name of the star is called Wormwood, and many men died of the waters, because they were bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.12'>And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for the third part thereof,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.13'>and the night likewise, And I saw and heard an angel flying in the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Wo, wo, wo to the inhabitants of the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels who are yet to sound.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.1'>And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star falling from heaven upon the earth, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.2'>And he opened the bottomless pit, and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.3'>And out of the smoke there went forth locusts upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.4'>And it was commanded them, not to hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only the men who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.5'>And it was given them, not to kill them, but that they should be tormented five months; and the torment of them is as the torment of a scorpion, when he stingeth a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.6'>And in those days the men shall seek death, but not find it; and shall desire to die, but death will flee from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.7'>And the appearances of the locusts are like horses made ready for battle; and on their heads are as it were crowns like gold, and their faces are as the faces of men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.8'>And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.9'>And they had breast-plates as it were breast-plates of iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.10'>And they have tails like scorpions, and stings were in their tails; and their power is, to hurt men five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.11'>And they have over them a king, the angel of the bottomless pit: his name in the Hebrew is Abaddon, but in the Greek he hath the name Apollyon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.12'>One wo is past: behold there come yet two woes after this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.13'>And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four corners of the golden altar which is before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.14'>Saying to the sixth angel, who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels who are bound in the great river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.15'>And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for the hour, and day, and month, and year, to kill the third part of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.16'>And the number of the army of horsemen was two hundred millions: I heard their number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.17'>And thus I saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them, having breast-plates of fire and hyacinth and brimstone: and the heads of the horses are as the heads of lions, and out of their mouths goeth fire, and smoke and brimstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.18'>By these three plagues were the third part of men killed, by the fire, and the smoke, and the brimstone which went out of their mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.19'>For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads, and with them they do hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.20'>And the rest of the men, who were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and wood, which can neither hear, nor see, nor walk:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.21'>Neither repented of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornications, nor of their thefts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.1'>And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow upon his head, and his face as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.2'>And he had in his hand a little book opened, and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.3'>And he cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth; and while he cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.4'>And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven, saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders have uttered, and write them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.5'>And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his right hand toward heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.6'>And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are therein, There shall be no more a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.7'>But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall sound, the mystery of God shall be fulfilled, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.8'>And the voice which I heard from heaven spake with me again, and said, Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who standeth on the sea and on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.9'>And I went to the angel, saying to him, Give me the little book. And he saith to me, Take and eat it up, and it will make thy belly bitter, but it will be sweet as honey in thy mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.10'>And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey, but when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.11'>And he saith to me, Thou must prophesy again concerning people, and nations, and tongues, and many kings.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.1'>And there was given me a reed, like a measuring rod; and he said, Arise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.2'>But the court which is without the temple cast out and measure it not: for it is given to the Gentiles: and they shall tread the holy city forty two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.3'>And I will give to my two witnesses to prophesy twelve hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.4'>These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks, standing before the Lord of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.5'>And if any one would hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies, and if any would kill them, he must thus be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.6'>These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophesying, and have power over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.7'>And when they shall have finished their testimony, the wild beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit, shall make war with them, and conquer them, and kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.8'>And their dead bodies shall be in the street of the great city, which is called spiritual Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.9'>And some of the people, and tribes, and tongues, and nations, shall behold their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in a grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.10'>And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and shall make merry, and send gifts to one another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.11'>And after the three days and an half, the spirit of life from God came into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that saw them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.12'>And I heard a great voice saying from heaven to them, Come up hither. And they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies beheld them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.13'>And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and there were slain in the earthquake seven thousand men, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.14'>The second wo is past: behold the third wo cometh quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.15'>And the seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.16'>And the four and twenty elders, who sat before God on their thrones, fell on their faces and worshiped God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.17'>Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who is, and who was, because thou hast taken thy great power, and hast reigned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.18'>And the nations were wroth: and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they be judged, and to give a reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name, small and great, and to destroy them that destroyed the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.19'>And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of the covenant was seen in the temple, and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.1'>And a great sign was seen in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.2'>And being with child she crieth, travailing in birth and pained to be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.3'>And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.4'>And his tail draweth the third part of the stars of heaven, and casteth them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered, that when she had brought forth, he might devour the child.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.12.7'>And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.8'>And he prevailed not, neither was his place found any more in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.9'>And the great dragon was cast out, the antient serpent, who is called the devil and satan, who deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out unto the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.10'>And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come the salvation, and the might, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ, for the accuser of our brethren is cast out, who accused them before our God day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.11'>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.12'>Therefore rejoice ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them: Wo to the earth and the sea; for the devil is come down to you, having great wrath; because he knoweth he hath but a little time.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.12.14'>And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is fed for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.15'>And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.21.11'>Having the glory of God: her window was like the most precious stone, like a jasper stone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.12'>clear as crystal, Having a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and the names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: On the east three gates,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.13'>and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.14'>And the walls of the city had twelve foundations, and upon them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.21.16'>And the city lyeth four-square, and the length is as large as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs: the length, and the breadth, and the height of it, are equal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.17'>And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred forty-four reeds, the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.21.21'>And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.22'>And I saw no temple therein; for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.23'>And the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine on it; for the glory of God hath inlightened it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof.</verse>
