        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Since many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>Even as they delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto you in order, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>That you might know the certainty of those things, in which you have been instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zachariah, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were now well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the time of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And when Zachariah saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zachariah: for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And you shall have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zachariah said unto the angel, How shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stands in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto you, and to show you these glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And, behold, you shall be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because you believe not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people waited for Zachariah, and marveled that he tarried so long in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his service were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>And after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>Thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days in which he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, you that are highly favored, the Lord is with you: blessed are you among women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and considered in her mind what manner of greeting this should be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And, behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name JESUS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And, behold, your cousin Elizabeth, she has also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For with God nothing shall be impossible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>And entered into the house of Zachariah, and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it came to pass, that, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>And she spoke out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For, lo, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said, My soul does magnify the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>For he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For he that is mighty has done to me great things; and holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has showed strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He has put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he has sent empty away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his descendants forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now Elizabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbors and her cousins heard how the Lord had showed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zachariah, after the name of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said unto her, There is none of your kindred that is called by this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marveled all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, and praised God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were spread abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And his father Zachariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>And has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>The oath which he swore to our father Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Highest: for you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Through the tender mercy of our God; by which the dawn from on high has visited us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>(And this taxing was first made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this shall be a sign unto you; You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord has made known unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, who was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>Then he took him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>Lord, now let your servant depart in peace, according to your word:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>For my eyes have seen your salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>Which you have prepared before the face of all people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(Yea, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, who departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why have you thus dealt with us? behold, your father and I have sought you sorrowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And he said unto them, How is it that you sought me? knew you not that I must be about my Father's business?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>And they understood not the saying which he spoke unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zachariah in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And now also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which brings not forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>He answered and said unto them, He that has two coats, let him impart to him that has none; and he that has food, let him do likewise.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and asked him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>Now when he had ceased speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>And Simon answering said unto him, Teacher, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at your word I will let down the net.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And when they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish: and their net broke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>And they beckoned unto their partners, who were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from now on you shall catch men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And, behold, men brought in a bed a man who was a paralytic: and they sought a way to bring him in, and to lay him before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his bed into the midst before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, your sins are forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier, to say, Your sins be forgiven you; or to say, Rise up and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that you may know that the Son of man has power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the paralytic,) I say unto you, Arise, and take up your bed, and go into your house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>And Levi made himself a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of tax collectors and of others that sat down with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but you eat and drink?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>And he spoke also a parable unto them; No man puts a piece torn from a new garment upon an old; otherwise, then both the new makes a tear, and the piece that was taken out of the new does not match the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no man puts new wine into old wineskins; else the new wine will burst the wineskins, and be spilled, and the wineskins shall be destroyed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.43'>For a good tree brings not forth corrupt fruit; neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.44'>For every tree is known by its own fruit. For from thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.45'>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.46'>And why call me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.47'>Whosoever comes to me, and hears my sayings, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.48'>He is like a man who built a house, and dug deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.49'>But he that hears, and does not, is like a man that without a foundation built a house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.7'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick, and ready to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And when they came to Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>For he loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not yourself: for I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>Therefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto you: but say a word, and my servant shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>And it came to pass the next day that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and many people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and many people of the city were with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>And he came and touched the coffin: and they that bore him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto you, Arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is risen up among us; and, God has visited his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this report of him went forth throughout all Judea, and throughout all the region round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>And the disciples of John showed him all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Are you he that should come? or look we for another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>When the men were come unto him, they said, John the Baptist has sent us unto you, saying, Are you he that should come? or look we for another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things you have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went you out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>But what went you out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, they who are gorgeously appareled, and live in luxury, are in kings' courts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>But what went you out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>And all the people that heard him, and the tax collectors, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>And the Lord said, To what then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and you have not danced; we have mourned to you, and you have not wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and you say, He has a demon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of man has come eating and drinking; and you say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>But wisdom is justified by all her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>And one of the Pharisees asked him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And, behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat to eat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>Now when the Pharisee who had bidden him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him: for she is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have something to say unto you. And he said, Teacher, say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>There was a certain creditor who had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, You have rightly judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, See this woman? I entered into your house, you gave me no water for my feet: but she has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>You gave me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>My head with oil you did not anoint: but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>Therefore I say unto you, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>And he said unto her, Your sins are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>And they that sat to eat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgives sins also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>And certain women, who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered unto him of their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And when many people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bore fruit a hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>Those by the wayside are they that hear; then comes the devil, and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>Those on the rock are they, who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for awhile believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>And that which fell among thorns are they, who, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to maturity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But that on the good ground are they, who in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>No man, when he has lighted a lamp, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but sets it on a lampstand, that they who enter in may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither anything hid, that shall not be known and come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>Take heed therefore how you hear: for whosoever has, to him shall be given; and whosoever has not, from him shall be taken even that which he seems to have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>Then came to him his mother and his brothers, and could not reach him for the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>And it was told him by some who said, Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling up with water, and were in jeopardy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Teacher, Teacher, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commands even the winds and water, and they obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, who had demons for a long time, and wore no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of God most high? I beseech you, torment me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For often it had seized him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he broke the bonds, and was driven by the demon into the desert.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion: because many demons were entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would allow them to enter into them. And he allowed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>Then went the demons out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the demons were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>They also who saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the demons was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>Now the man out of whom the demons were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>Return to your own house, and show what great things God has done unto you. And he went his way, and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as he went the people thronged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Teacher, the multitude throng you and press you, and you say, Who touched me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>And Jesus said, Somebody has touched me: for I perceive that power has gone out of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: your faith has made you whole; go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While he yet spoke, there came one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, your daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>And when he came into the house, he allowed no man to go in, except Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the girl.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>And all wept, and mourned her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Child, arise.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, many people met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Teacher, I beseech you, look upon my son: for he is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>And, lo, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it convulses him so that he foams again, and bruising him seldom departs from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>And I besought your disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring your son here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>And as he was yet coming, the demon threw him down, and tore him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him about that saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>Then there arose a reasoning among them, as to which of them should be greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him beside him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receives me: and whosoever shall receive me receives him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>And John answered and said, Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he follows not with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, will you that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elijah did?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, You know not what manner of spirit you are of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow you wherever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but you go and preach the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>And another also said, Lord, I will follow you; but let me first go bid them farewell, who are at home at my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax collector.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>But they who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil has he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>And they were urgent with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they demanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming in from the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which never nursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they do these things with a green tree, what shall be done with the dry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his clothing, and cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he is Christ, the chosen of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>And saying, If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>And one of the malefactors who were hanged railed at him, saying, If you are Christ, save yourself and us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, seeing you are in the same condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto you, Today shall you be with me in paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>And the sun was darkened, and the curtain of the temple was torn in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the people that came together to see that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And all his acquaintances, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a member of the council and he was a good man, and just:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(The same had not consented to the council and the action of them;) he was of Arimathea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man went unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher that was hewn in stone, in which never man before was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath was coming on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women also, who came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulcher, and how his body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others came with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the ground, they said unto them, Why seek you the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered his words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>And returned from the sepulcher, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, who told these things unto the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulcher; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which had come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>And it came to pass, that, while they discussed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were held that they should not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said unto them, What manner of words are these that you have one to another, as you walk, and are sad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Are you a stranger in Jerusalem, and have not known the things which have come to pass there in these days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we hoped that it was he who should have redeemed Israel: and besides all this, today is the third day since these things were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, who were early at the sepulcher;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And certain of them who were with us went to the sepulcher, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Then he said unto them, O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they drew near unto the village, where they were going: and he made as though he would have gone further.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it came to pass, as he sat to eat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said one to another, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known to them in the breaking of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and said unto them, Peace be unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said unto them, Why are you troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have you here any food?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and a honeycomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>And he took it, and did eat before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said unto them, These are the words which I spoke unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it was fit for Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>And you are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you are endued with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</verse>
