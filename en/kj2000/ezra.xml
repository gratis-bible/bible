        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.1'>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.2'>Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.3'>Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.4'>And whosoever remains in any place where he sojourns, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with animals, besides the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.5'>Then rose up the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had stirred, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.6'>And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with articles of silver, with gold, with goods, and with animals, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.7'>Also Cyrus the king brought forth the articles of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.8'>Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and counted them out unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.9'>And this is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, a thousand platters of silver, nine and twenty knives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.10'>Thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a similar sort four hundred and ten, and other articles a thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.11'>All the articles of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with those of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.2.69'>They gave according to their ability to the treasury of the work threescore and one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestsâ€™ garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.2.70'>So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the Nethinim, dwelt in their towns, and all Israel in their towns.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.1'>And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the towns, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.2'>Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.3'>And they set the altar upon its bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.4'>They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.5'>And afterward offered the continual burnt offerings, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.6'>From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.7'>They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, unto them of Sidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea to Joppa, according to the grant that they had from Cyrus king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.8'>Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to oversee the work of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.9'>Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to oversee the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.10'>And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, according to the ordinance of David king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.11'>And they sang together responsively in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endures forever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'>But many of the priests and Levites and heads of the fathersâ€™ houses, who were old men, who had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'>So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.1'>Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity built the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'>Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as you do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of Israel, said unto them, You have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.5'>And hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.6'>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.7'>And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in Aramaic, and set forth in the Aramaic language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.8'>Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this fashion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.9'>Then wrote Rehum the commander, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the judges, the governors, the officials, the Persians, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, and the Elamites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.10'>And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and settled in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.11'>This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Your servants the men on this side the river, send greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.12'>Be it known unto the king, that the Jews who came up from you to us have come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and wicked city, and are finishing its walls, and repairing the foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'>Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city is built, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so you shall impair the revenue of the kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'>Now because we receive support from the kingâ€™s palace, and it was not proper for us to see the kingâ€™s dishonor, therefore have we sent and informed the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.15'>That search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers: so shall you find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and harmful unto kings and provinces, and that they have incited sedition within the city from of old: for which cause was this city destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'>We inform the king that, if this city is built again, and its walls finished, by this means you shall have no dominion on this side of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'>Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the commander, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'>The letter which you sent unto us has been plainly read before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'>And I commanded, and search has been made, and it is found that this city from of old has made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.20'>There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.21'>Give you now command to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until another command shall be given from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.22'>Take heed now that you fail not to do this: why should damage increase to the hurt of the kings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.23'>Now when the copy of king Artaxerxesâ€™ letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.24'>Then ceased the work on the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.1'>Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.2'>Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.3'>At the same time came to them Tattenai, governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who has commanded you to build this house, and to restore this wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.4'>Then said we unto them after this manner, These are the names of the men that make this building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.5'>But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned an answer by letter concerning this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.6'>The copy of the letter that Tattenai, governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions the governors, who were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.7'>They sent a letter unto him, in which was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.8'>Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goes on diligently, and prospers in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.9'>Then asked we those elders, and said unto them, Who commanded you to build this house, and to complete these walls?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.10'>We asked their names also, to inform you, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.11'>And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.12'>But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.13'>But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.14'>And the articles also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.15'>And said unto him, Take these articles, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.16'>Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now has it been in building, and yet it is not finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.17'>Now therefore, if it seems good to the king, let there be search made in the kingâ€™s treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.1'>Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the scrolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.2'>And there was found at Ecbatana, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a scroll, and in it was a record thus written:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.3'>In the first year of Cyrus the king, the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let its foundations be strongly laid; its height threescore cubits, and its breadth threescore cubits;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.4'>With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the kingâ€™s house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.5'>And also let the golden and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place, and place them in the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.6'>Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-bozenai, and your companions the governors, who are beyond the river, keep yourselves far from there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.7'>Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.8'>Moreover I make a decree of what you shall do for the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the kingâ€™s goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, without delay expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.9'>And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the requirement of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.10'>That they may offer sacrifices of sweet aroma unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.11'>Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be impaled thereon; and let his house be made a pile of rubble because of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.12'>And the God that has caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put their hand to alter it and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done diligently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.13'>Then Tattenai, governor on this side of the river, Shethar-boznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.14'>And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo.

        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.15'>And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.16'>And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.17'>And offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.18'>And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their divisions, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.19'>And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.20'>For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were purified, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.21'>And the children of Israel, who had come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.22'>And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.15'>And I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.16'>Then I sent for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, leading men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.21'>Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.22'>For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.23'>So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he answered our prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.24'>Then I separated twelve of the leaders of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.25'>And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the articles, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.26'>I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver articles worth a hundred talents, and of gold a hundred talents;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.27'>Also twenty bowls of gold, worth a thousand darics; and two vessels of fine polished bronze, as precious as gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.28'>And I said unto them, You are holy unto the LORD; the articles are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.29'>Watch, and keep them, until you weigh them before the leaders of the priests and the Levites, and heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.30'>So the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the articles, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.31'>Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.1'>Now when these things were done, the leaders came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, in regard to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.2'>For they have taken of their daughters as wives for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy race has mixed itself with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the leaders and rulers has been foremost in this trespass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.3'>And when I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down appalled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.4'>Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat appalled until the evening sacrifice.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.7'>Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to humiliation, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.8'>And now for a little while grace has been shown from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us security in his holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.9'>For we were slaves; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to rebuild the house of our God, and to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.10'>And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken your commandments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.11'>Which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which you go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.13'>And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that you our God has punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and has given us such deliverance as this;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.14'>Should we again break your commandments, and join in marriage with the people of these abominations? would not you be angry with us till you had consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.15'>O LORD God of Israel, you are righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before you in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before you because of this.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.1'>Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.2'>And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.3'>Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.6'>Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came there, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.7'>And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.10'>And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, You have transgressed, and have taken foreign wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.12'>Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As you has said, so must we do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.13'>But the people are many, and it is a time of heavy rain, and we are not able to stand outside, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.14'>Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them who have taken foreign wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter is turned from us.</verse>
