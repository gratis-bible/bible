        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Exod.1'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.1'>Now these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.2'>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.3'>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.4'>Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.5'>And all persons that were direct offspring of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.6'>And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.7'>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.8'>Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.9'>And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.10'>Come, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there come upon us any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so escape out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.11'>Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.12'>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.13'>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.14'>And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, in which they made them serve, was with rigor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.15'>And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.16'>And he said, When you serve as a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then you shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.17'>But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.18'>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have you done this thing, and have saved the male children alive?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.19'>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous, and are delivered before the midwives come in unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.20'>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.21'>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he gave them families.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.22'>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.2'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.1'>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.2'>And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.3'>And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with tar and with pitch, and put the child in it; and she laid it among the reeds by the river's bank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.4'>And his sister stood far off, to know what would be done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.5'>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her maid to get it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.6'>And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.7'>Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to you a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.8'>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the girl went and called the child's mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.9'>And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.10'>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.11'>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.12'>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.13'>And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Why strike you your fellow?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.14'>And he said, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? do you intend to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.15'>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.16'>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.17'>And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.18'>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you are come so soon today?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.19'>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.20'>And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that you have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.21'>And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.22'>And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.23'>And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel groaned by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.24'>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.25'>And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had concern for them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.3'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.1'>Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the west side of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.2'>And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.3'>And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.4'>And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.5'>And he said, Draw not near here: put off your shoes from your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.6'>Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, andthe God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.7'>And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.8'>And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good and large land, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.9'>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.10'>Come now therefore, and I will send you unto Pharaoh, that you may bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.11'>And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.12'>And he said, Certainly I will be with you; and this shall be a token unto you, that I have sent you: When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God upon this mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.13'>And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers has sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.14'>And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shall you say unto the children of Israel, I AM has sent me unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.15'>And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shall you say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me unto you: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.16'>Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers,the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.17'>And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.18'>And they shall hearken to your voice: and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and you shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has met with us: and now let us go, we beseech you, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.19'>And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.20'>And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of it: and after that he will let you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.21'>And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when you go, you shall not go empty:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.22'>But every woman shall request of her neighbor, and of her that sojourns in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing: and you shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and you shall spoil the Egyptians.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.4'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.1'>And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD has not appeared unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.2'>And the LORD said unto him, What is that inyour hand? And he said, A rod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.3'>And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.4'>And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth yourhand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.5'>That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.6'>And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Putnow your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was as leprous as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.7'>And he said, Put your hand into your bosomagain. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and took it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.8'>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe you, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.9'>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which you take out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.10'>And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before, nor since you have spoken unto your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.11'>And the LORD said unto him, Who has made man's mouth? or who makes the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.12'>Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.13'>And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray you, by the hand of another whom you will send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.14'>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he comes forth to meet you: and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.15'>And you shall speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.16'>And he shall be your spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to you instead of a mouth, and you shall be to him instead of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.17'>And you shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.18'>And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray you, and return unto my brethren who are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.19'>And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead who sought your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.20'>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.21'>And the LORD said unto Moses, When you goto return into Egypt, see that you do all those wonders before Pharaoh, whom I have put in your hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.22'>And you shall say unto Pharaoh, Thus says the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.23'>And I say unto you, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay your son, even your firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.24'>And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.25'>Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband are you to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.26'>So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband you are, because of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.27'>And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into thewilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.28'>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.29'>And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.30'>And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.31'>And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.5'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.1'>And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.2'>And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.3'>And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us: let us go, we pray you, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.4'>And the king of Egypt said unto them, Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? get you unto your burdens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.5'>And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and you make them rest from their burdens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.6'>And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.7'>You shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as before: let them go and gather straw for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.8'>And the number of the bricks, which they did make before, you shall lay upon them; you shall not diminish any of them: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.9'>Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor in it; and let them not give regard to vain words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.10'>And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.11'>Go, get you straw where you can find it: yet not any of your work shall be diminished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.12'>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.13'>And the taskmasters pushed them, saying, Fulfill your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.14'>And the officers of the children of Israel, that Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and asked, Why have you not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today, as before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.15'>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Why dealt you thus with your servants?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.16'>There is no straw given unto your servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.17'>But he said, you are idle, you are idle: therefore you say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.33.1'>And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I swore unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto your descendants will I give it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.2'>And I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.3'>Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of you; for you are a stiff-necked people: lest I consume you in the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.4'>And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.5'>For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, you are a stiff-necked people: I will come up into the midst of you in a moment, and consume you: therefore now put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what to do unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.6'>And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.7'>And Moses took a tent, and pitched it outside the camp, far off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one who sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of meeting, which was outside the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.8'>And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.9'>And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.10'>And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshiped, every man in his tent door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.11'>And the LORD spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.12'>And Moses said unto the LORD, See, you say unto me, Bring up this people: and you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, I know you by name, and you have also found grace in my sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.13'>Now therefore, I pray you, if I have found grace in your sight, show me now your way, that I may know you, that I may find grace in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.14'>And he said, My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.15'>And he said unto him, If your presence go not with me, carry us not up from here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.16'>For how shall it be known here that I and your people have found grace in your sight? is it not in that you go with us? so shall we be separated, I and your people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.17'>And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that you have spoken: for you have found grace in my sight, and I know you by name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.18'>And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.19'>And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.20'>And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.21'>And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand upon a rock:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.22'>And it shall come to pass, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand while I pass by:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.33.23'>And I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back: but my face shall not be seen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Exod.34'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.1'>And the LORD said unto Moses, Cut out two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which you broke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.2'>And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me in the top of the mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.3'>And no man shall come up with you, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.4'>And he cut out two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.5'>And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.6'>And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.7'>Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.8'>And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.9'>And he said, If now I have found grace in your sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray you, go among us; for it is a stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.10'>And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the LORD: for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.11'>Observe that which I command you this day: behold, I drive out before you the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite,and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.12'>Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you go, lest it be for a snare in the midst of you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.13'>But you shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their idol poles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.14'>For you shall worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.15'>Lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go play the harlot after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call you, and you eat of his sacrifice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.16'>And you take of their daughters unto your sons, and their daughters go play the harlot after their gods, and make your sons go play the harlot after their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.17'>You shall make you no molten gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.18'>The feast of unleavened bread shall you keep. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.19'>All that opens the womb is mine; and every firstling among your cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.20'>But the firstling of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb: and if you redeem it not, then shall you break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.21'>Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.22'>And you shall observe the feast of weeks, of the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.23'>Three times in the year shall all your male children appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.24'>For I will cast out the nations before you, and enlarge your borders: neither shall any man desire your land, when you shall go up to appear before the LORD your God three times in the year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.25'>You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.26'>The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring unto the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.27'>And the LORD said unto Moses, Write these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.28'>And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.29'>And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.30'>And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.31'>And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.32'>And afterward all the children of Israel came near: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him on mount Sinai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.33'>And till Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.34'>But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out. And he came out, and spoke unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.35'>And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</verse>
