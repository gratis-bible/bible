        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Esth.1'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.1'>Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus who reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.2'>That in those days, when king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the citadel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.3'>In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the powers of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.4'>When he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and fourscore days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.5'>And when these days were completed, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the citadel, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.6'>Where there were white, green, and blue hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white and black marble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.7'>And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being different one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.8'>And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had ordered all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.9'>Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.10'>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.11'>To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look upon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.12'>But queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his eunuchs: therefore was the king very angry, and his anger burned within him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.13'>Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.14'>And next to him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and who sat first in the kingdom;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.15'>What shall we do unto queen Vashti according to law, because she has not obeyed the commandment of king Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.16'>And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen has not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.17'>For this deed of the queen shall become known to all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be said, King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.18'>Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, who have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.19'>If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.20'>And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.21'>And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.22'>For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.1'>After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was abated, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.2'>Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be beautiful young virgins sought out for the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.3'>And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins unto Shushan the citadel, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the king's eunuch, keeper of the women; and let their beautifying ointments be given them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.4'>And let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.5'>Now in Shushan the citadel there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.6'>Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.7'>And he had brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took as his own daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.8'>So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the citadel, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.9'>And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her beautifying ointments, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, who were suitable to be given her, out of the king's house: and he moved her and her maidens unto the best place of the house of the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.10'>Esther had not revealed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not show it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.11'>And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.12'>Now when every maiden's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after she had been there twelve months, according to the regulations for the women, (for so were the days of their beautification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfumes, and with other preparations for beautifying women;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.13'>Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.14'>In the evening she went, and the next day she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch, who kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.15'>Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.16'>So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.17'>And the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.18'>Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a holiday in all the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the liberality of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.19'>And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.20'>Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther obeyed the command of Mordecai, just as when she was brought up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.21'>In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, of those who kept the door, were angry, and sought to lay hands on king Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.22'>And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king of it in Mordecai's name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.23'>And when inquiry was made into the matter, it was confirmed; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.1'>After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.2'>And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and paid homage to Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor paid him homage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.3'>Then the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgress you the king's commandment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.4'>Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's words would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.5'>And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor paid him homage, then was Haman full of wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.6'>And he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.7'>In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.8'>And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws are different from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to tolerate them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.9'>If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.10'>And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.11'>And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.12'>Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people according to their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.13'>And the letters were sent by couriers into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.14'>The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.15'>The couriers went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the citadel. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.1'>When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.2'>And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.3'>And in every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.4'>So Esther's maids and her eunuchs came and told it to her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent garments to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.5'>Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend to her, and gave him a command concerning Mordecai, to learn what it was, and why it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.6'>So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.7'>And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.8'>Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.9'>And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.10'>Again Esther spoke unto Hathach, and gave him command concerning Mordecai;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.11'>All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.12'>And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.13'>Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not to yourself that you shall escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.14'>For if you altogether hold your peace at this time, then shall relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but you and your father's house shall be destroyed: and who knows whether you are come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.15'>Then Esther told them to return Mordecai this answer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.16'>Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.17'>So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.5'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.1'>Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, opposite the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, opposite the entrance of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.2'>And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the scepter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.3'>Then said the king unto her, What do you wish, queen Esther? and what is your request? it shall be even given you to the half of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.4'>And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.5'>Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther has said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.6'>And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is your petition? and it shall be granted you: and what is your request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.7'>Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.8'>If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.9'>Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor trembled before him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.10'>Nevertheless Haman restrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.11'>And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.12'>Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow I am invited unto her also with the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.13'>Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.14'>Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak you unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go you in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.6'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.1'>On that night the king could not sleep, and he commanded to be brought the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.2'>And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on king Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.3'>And the king said, What honor and dignity has been bestowed upon Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.4'>And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king's house, to ask the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.5'>And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman stands in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.6'>So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.7'>And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.8'>Let the royal robes be brought which the king has worn, and the horse that the king rides upon, and the royal crown which is set upon his head:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.9'>And let the robes and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man with whom the king delights to honor, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.10'>Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sits at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.11'>Then took Haman the robes and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delights to honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.12'>And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hastened to his house mourning, and having his head covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.13'>And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the descendants of the Jews, before whom you have begun to fall, you shall not prevail against him, but shall surely fall before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.14'>And while they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs came, and hastened to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.7'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.1'>So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.2'>And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is your petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted you: and what is your request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.3'>Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.4'>For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I would have held my tongue, although the enemy could never compensate for the king's loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.5'>Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that dares presume in his heart to do so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.6'>And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.7'>And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.8'>Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed on which Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.9'>And Harbona, one of the eunuchs, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, stands in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.10'>So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath abated.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.8'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.1'>On that day did king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.2'>And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.3'>And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his plot that he had devised against the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.4'>Then the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.5'>And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seems right before the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.6'>For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.7'>Then king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.8'>Write you also for the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.9'>Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to its own writing, and unto every people according to their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.10'>And he wrote in king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by couriers on horseback, and riding on royal horses bred from swift horses:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.11'>By these the king granted the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together, and to defend their lives, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the forces of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to take their possessions for a spoil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.12'>Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.13'>The copy of the writing for a command to be given in every province was published unto all people, so that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.14'>So the couriers that rode upon royal horses went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's command. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.15'>And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.16'>The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.17'>And in every province, and in every city, wherever the king's command and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.9'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.1'>Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's command and his decree drew near to be executed, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.2'>The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their harm: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.3'>And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and officials of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.4'>For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai grew greater and greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.5'>Thus the Jews defeated all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.6'>And in Shushan the citadel the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.7'>And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.8'>And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.9'>And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vaizatha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.10'>The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, they killed; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.11'>On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the citadel was brought before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.12'>And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the citadel, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what is your petition? and it shall be granted you: or what is your request further? and it shall be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.13'>Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.14'>And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.15'>For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed three hundred men at Shushan; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.16'>But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and defended their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and killed of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the spoil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.17'>On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.18'>But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.19'>Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending presents one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.20'>And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, both near and far,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.21'>To establish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.22'>As the days on which the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feast</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.23'>And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.24'>Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.25'>But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked plot, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.26'>Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.27'>The Jews ordained, and took upon themselves, and upon their descendants, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to what was written, and according to their appointed time every year;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.28'>And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fall into disuse among the Jews, nor the memory of them perish from their descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.29'>Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter about Purim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.30'>And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.31'>To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their descendants, concerning the matters of the fastings and their lamentations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.32'>And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.10'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.1'>And king Ahasuerus imposed tribute upon the land, and upon the coastlands of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.2'>And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.3'>For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of his brethren, seeking the welfare of his people, and speaking peace to all his countrymen.</verse>
