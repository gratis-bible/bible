        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.1'>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.2'>To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.3'>It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.4'>Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.5'>Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you, and I ordained you a prophet unto the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.6'>Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.7'>But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for you shall go to all that I shall send you, and whatsoever I command you you shall speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.8'>Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with you to deliver you, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.9'>Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.10'>See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.11'>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.12'>Then said the LORD unto me, You have well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.13'>And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What see you? And I said, I see a boiling pot; and it is facing away from the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.14'>Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.15'>For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set everyone his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls round about, and against all the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.16'>And I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.17'>You therefore prepare yourself, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command you: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound you before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.18'>For, behold, I have made you this day a fenced city, and an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.19'>And they shall fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you; for I am with you, says the LORD, to deliver you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.1'>Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.2'>Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says the LORD; I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your betrothal, when you followed me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.3'>Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.4'>Hear you the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.5'>Thus says the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they have gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.6'>Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.7'>And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat its fruit and its goodness; but when you entered, you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.8'>The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the rulers also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.9'>Therefore I will yet plead with you, says the LORD, and with your childrenâ€™s children will I plead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.10'>For pass over the coasts of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.11'>Has a nation changed its gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.12'>Be astonished, O you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be you very desolate, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.13'>For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed themselves out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.14'>Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he plundered?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.15'>The young lions roared upon him, and growled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.16'>Also the children of Noph and Tahpanes have broken the crown of your head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.17'>Have you not brought this unto yourself, in that you have forsaken the LORD your God, when he led you by the way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.18'>And now what have you to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what have you to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.19'>Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that you have forsaken the LORD your God, and that my fear is not in you, says the Lord GOD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.20'>For from of old I have broken your yoke, and burst your bands; and you said, I will nottransgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree you wander, playing the harlot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.21'>Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a wild vine unto me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.22'>For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me, says the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.23'>How can you say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see your way in the valley, know what you have done: you are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.24'>A wild donkey used to the wilderness, that sniffs in the wind in her desire; in her mating time who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.25'>Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst: but you said, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.26'>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.27'>Saying to a tree, You are my father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.28'>But where are your gods that you have made yourself? let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.29'>Why will you plead with me? you all have transgressed against me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.30'>In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.31'>O generation, see you the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? why say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.32'>Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.33'>Why beautify your way to seek love? therefore have you also taught the wicked ones your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.34'>Also on your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but plainly upon all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.35'>Yet you say, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with you, because you say, I have not sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.36'>Why gad you about so much to change your way? you also shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.37'>Yea, you shall go forth from him, with your hands upon your head: for the LORD has rejected your trusted ones, and you shall not prosper in them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.1'>They say, If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him, and becomes another manâ€™s, may he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but you have played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.2'>Lift up your eyes unto the high places, and see where you have not been lain with. In the ways have you sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your harlotries and with your wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.3'>Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you had a harlotâ€™s forehead, you refused to be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.4'>Will you not from this time cry unto me, My father, you are the guide of my youth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.5'>Will he reserve his anger forever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, you have spoken and done all the evil things that you could.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.6'>The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? she has gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.7'>And I said after she had done all these things, Turn you unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.8'>And I saw, when for all the causes for which backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.9'>And it came to pass through the lightness of her harlotry, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.10'>And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not turned unto me with her whole heart, but in pretense, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.11'>And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel has justified herself more than treacherous Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.12'>Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, says the LORD; and I will not cause my anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, says the LORD, and I will not keep anger forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.13'>Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against the LORD your God, and have scattered your favors to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed my voice, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.14'>Turn, O backsliding children, says the LORD; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one from a city, and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.15'>And I will give you shepherds according to my heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.16'>And it shall come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.17'>At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.18'>In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.19'>But I said, How shall I put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a beautiful heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, You shall call me, My father; and shall not turn away from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.20'>Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so have you dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.21'>A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the LORD their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.22'>Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto you; for you are the LORD our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.23'>Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.24'>For shame has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.25'>We lie down in our shame, and our disgrace covers us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.1'>If you will return, O Israel, says the LORD, return unto me: and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight, then shall you not be moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.2'>And you shall swear, The LORD lives, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.3'>For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.4'>Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.5'>Declare you in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow you the trumpet in the land: cry, Gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.6'>Set up the standard toward Zion: take refuge, delay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.7'>The lion has come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the nations is on his way; he has gone forth from his place to make your land desolate; and your cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.8'>For this gird yourselves with sackcloth, lament and wail: for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned back from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.9'>And it shall come to pass at that day, says the LORD, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.10'>Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You shall have peace; when the sword reaches unto the soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.11'>At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places blows in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.12'>Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.13'>Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.14'>O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.15'>For a voice declares from Dan, and proclaims affliction from mount Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.16'>Make mention to the nations; behold, proclaim against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.17'>Like keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she has been rebellious against me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.18'>Your way and your doings have procured these things unto you; this is your wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reaches unto your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.19'>My soul, my soul! I am pained at my very heart; my heart makes a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.20'>Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is plundered: suddenly are my tents plundered, and my curtains in a moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.21'>How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.22'>For my people are foolish, they have not known me; they are stupid children, and they have no understanding: they are wise to do evil, but how to do good they have no knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.23'>I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.24'>I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved to and fro.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.25'>I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.26'>I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.27'>For thus has the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.28'>For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not relent, neither will I turn back from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.29'>The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.30'>And when you are plundered, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with crimson, though you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with paint, in vain shall you make yourself fair; your lovers will despise you, they will seek your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.31'>For I have heard a voice like a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewails herself, that spreads her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.1'>Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in its broad places, if you can find a man, if there is any that executes justice, that seeks the truth; and I will pardon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.2'>And though they say, The LORD lives; surely they swear falsely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.3'>O LORD, are not your eyes upon the truth? you have stricken them, but they have not grieved; you have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.4'>Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, nor the law of their God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.10.1'>Hear you the word which the LORD speaks unto you, O house of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.2'>Thus says the LORD, Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.3'>For the customs of the people are vain: for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.4'>They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it moves not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.5'>They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.6'>Since as there is none like unto you, O LORD; you are great, and your name is great in might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.7'>Who would not fear you, O King of nations? for to you is it due: since among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.8'>But they are altogether senseless and foolish: the wooden idol is a doctrine of vanities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.9'>Silver beaten into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the craftsman, and of the hands of the goldsmith: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of skillful men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.10'>But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to endure his indignation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.11'>Thus shall you say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.12'>He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens at his discretion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.13'>When he utters his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings with rain, and brings forth the wind out of his storehouses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.14'>Every man is senseless in his knowledge: every goldsmith is put to shame by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.15'>They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their judgment they shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.16'>The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.17'>Gather up your wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.18'>For thus says the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may find it so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.19'>Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.20'>My tent is plundered, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent anymore, and to set up my curtains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.21'>For the shepherds have become senseless, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.22'>Behold, the noise of the report has come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of jackals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.23'>O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man who walks to direct his steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.24'>O LORD, correct me, but with justice; not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.25'>Pour out your fury upon the nations that know you not, and upon the families that call not on your name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.11.4'>Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall you be my people, and I will be your God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.5'>That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.6'>Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear you the words of this covenant, and do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.7'>For I earnestly warned your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and warning, saying, Obey my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.8'>Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked everyone in the imagination of his evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but they did them not.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.11.10'>They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.11.13'>For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.14'>Therefore pray not you for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.15'>What has my beloved to do in my house, seeing she has worked lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from you? when you do evil, then you rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.16'>The LORD called your name, A green olive tree, fair, and with good fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.17'>For the LORD of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.18'>And the LORD has given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then you showed me their doings.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.11.20'>But, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously, who tests the mind and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for unto you have I revealed my cause.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.12.3'>But you, O LORD, know me: you have seen me, and tested my heart toward you: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.4'>How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell in it? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.5'>If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, in which you trusted, they wearied you, then how will you do in the jungle of the Jordan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.6'>For even your brethren, and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; yea, they have called a multitude after you: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.7'>I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.13.11'>For as the belt clings to the waist of a man, so have I caused to cling unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, says the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.12'>Therefore you shall speak unto them this word; Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Every wineskin shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto you, Do we not certainly know that every wineskin shall be filled with wine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.13'>Then shall you say unto them, Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon Davidâ€™s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.14'>And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, says the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.22.2'>And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sits upon the throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people that enter in by these gates:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.3'>Thus says the LORD; Execute justice and righteousness, and deliver the plundered out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.4'>For if you do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.5'>But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself, says the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.6'>For thus says the LORD unto the kingâ€™s house of Judah; You are Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I will make you a wilderness; and cities which are not inhabited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.7'>And I will prepare destroyers against you, everyone with his weapons: and they shall cut down your choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.8'>And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Why has the LORD done thus unto this great city?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.9'>Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshiped other gods, and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.10'>Weep not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep bitterly for him that goes away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.11'>For thus says the LORD concerning Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, who went forth out of this place; He shall not return here any more:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.12'>But he shall die in the place where they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.13'>Woe unto him that builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that uses his neighborâ€™s service without wages, and gives him nothing for his work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.14'>That says, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cuts him out windows for it; and it is paneled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.15'>Shall you reign, because you enclose yourself in cedar? did not your father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness, and then it was well with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.16'>He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.17'>But your eyes and your heart are for nothing but for your covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.18'>Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.19'>He shall be buried with the burial of a donkey, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.20'>Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up your voice in Bashan, and cry from the passes: for all your lovers are destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.21'>I spoke unto you in your prosperity; but you said, I will not hear. This has been your manner from your youth, that you obeyed not my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.22'>The wind shall eat up all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity: surely then you shall be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.23'>O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makes your nest in the cedars, how gracious shall you be when pangs come upon you, the pain as of a woman in travail!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.24'>As I live, says the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck you from there;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.25'>And I will give you into the hand of them that seek your life, and into the hand of them whose face you fear, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.26'>And I will cast you out, and your mother that bore you, into another country, where you were not born; and there shall you die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.27'>But to the land to which they desire to return, there shall they not return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.28'>Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel in which is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his descendants, and are cast into a land which they know not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.29'>O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.30'>Thus says the LORD, Write this man down as childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his descendants shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.23'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.1'>Woe be unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.2'>Therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel against the shepherds that feed my people; You have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.3'>And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.4'>And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.5'>Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.6'>In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name by which he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.7'>Therefore, behold, the days come, says the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.8'>But, The LORD lives, who brought up and who led the descendants of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries where I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.9'>My heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.10'>For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourns; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their might is not right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.11'>For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.12'>Therefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall in it: for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their punishment, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.13'>And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.14'>I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none does return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and its inhabitants as Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.15'>Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the poisonous water: for from the prophets of Jerusalem has profaneness gone forth into all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.16'>Thus says the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you worthless: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.17'>They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD has said, You shall have peace; and they say unto everyone that walks after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.18'>For who has stood in the counsel of the LORD, and has perceived and heard his word? who has marked his word, and heard it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.19'>Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD has gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.20'>The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he has executed, and till he has performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days you shall consider it perfectly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.21'>I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.22'>But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.23'>Am I a God at hand, says the LORD, and not a God afar off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.24'>Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? says the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.25'>I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.26'>How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.27'>Who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.28'>The prophet that has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.29'>Is not my word like a fire? says the LORD; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.30'>Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, says the LORD, that steal my words everyone from his neighbor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.31'>Behold, I am against the prophets, says the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.32'>Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, says the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their recklessness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.33'>And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? you shall then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.34'>And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.35'>Thus shall you say everyone to his neighbor, and everyone to his brother, What has the LORD answered? and, What has the LORD spoken?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.36'>And the burden of the LORD shall you mention no more: for every manâ€™s word shall be his burden; for you have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.37'>Thus shall you say to the prophet, What has the LORD answered you? and, What has the LORD spoken?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.38'>But since you say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus says the LORD; Because you say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, You shall not say, The burden of the LORD;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.39'>Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.40'>And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.24'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.24.1'>The LORD showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.24.2'>One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.24.3'>Then said the LORD unto me, What see you, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.24.4'>Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.24.5'>Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.24.6'>For I will set my eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.24.7'>And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.24.8'>And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad; surely thus says the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the rest of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.24.9'>And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their harm, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.24.10'>And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.25'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.1'>The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.2'>Which Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.3'>From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD has come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but you have not hearkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.4'>And the LORD has sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but you have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.5'>They said, Turn you again now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD has given unto you and to your fathers forever and ever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.6'>And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.7'>Yet you have not hearkened unto me, says the LORD; that you might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.8'>Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts; Because you have not heard my words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.9'>Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, says the LORD, and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.10'>Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.11'>And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.12'>And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, says the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.13'>And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that are written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.14'>For many nations and great kings shall be served by them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.15'>For thus says the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury from my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.16'>And they shall drink, and stagger, and go mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.17'>Then took I the cup from the LORDâ€™S hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.25.27'>Therefore you shall say unto them, Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink, and be drunken, and vomit, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.28'>And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then shall you say unto them, Thus says the LORD of hosts; You shall certainly drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.29'>For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should you be utterly unpunished? You shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.30'>Therefore prophesy against them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.31'>A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD has a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, says the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.25.36'>A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and a wailing of the leaders of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD has plundered their pasture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.37'>And the peaceful habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.25.38'>He has forsaken his lair, like a lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.26'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.1'>In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.2'>Thus says the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORDâ€™S house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORDâ€™S house, all the words that I command you to speak unto them; diminish not a word:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.3'>It may be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may relent concerning the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.4'>And you shall say unto them, Thus says the LORD; If you will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.5'>To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but you have not hearkened;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.6'>Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.7'>So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.8'>Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, You shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.9'>Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.10'>When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the kingâ€™s house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entrance of the new gate of the LORDâ€™S house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.11'>Then spoke the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.12'>Then spoke Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.32.2'>For then the king of Babylonâ€™s army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judahâ€™s house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.3'>For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy, and say, Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.4'>And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.5'>And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, says the LORD: though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.6'>And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.7'>Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come unto you, saying, Buy my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.</verse>

Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.9'>And I bought the field of Hanamel my uncleâ€™s son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.10'>And I signed the deed, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.11'>So I took the deed of purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.12'>And I gave the deed of purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the sight of Hanamel my uncleâ€™s son, and in the presence of the witnesses that signed the deed of purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.13'>And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.32.22'>And have given them this land, which you did swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.23'>And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not your voice, neither walked in your law; they have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do: therefore you have caused all this disaster to come upon them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.24'>Behold the siege mounds, they have come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what you have spoken has come to pass; and, behold, you see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.25'>And you have said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.26'>Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.32.31'>For this city has been to me as a provocation of my anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.32'>Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.33'>And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.34'>But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.35'>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.36'>And now therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, of which you say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.37'>Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, where I have driven them in my anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.38'>And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.39'>And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.50.34'>Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, but unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.35'>A sword is upon the Chaldeans, says the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.36'>A sword is upon the diviners; and they shall become fools: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.37'>A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mixed people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.38'>A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad over their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.39'>Therefore the wild beasts of the desert shall dwell there with the jackals, and the ostriches shall dwell in it: and it shall be no more inhabited forever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.40'>As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities, says the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.41'>Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the ends of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.42'>They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not show mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, everyone set in array, like a man for the battle, against you, O daughter of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.43'>The king of Babylon has heard the report of them, and his hands grew feeble: anguish took hold of him, and birth pangs as of a woman in travail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.44'>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the thickets of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will arraign me? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.45'>Therefore hear you the counsel of the LORD, that he has taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.46'>At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.51'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.1'>Thus says the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.2'>And will send unto Babylon winnowers, that shall winnow her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.3'>Against him that bends let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifts himself up in his armor: and spare you not her young men; destroy you utterly all her army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.4'>Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.5'>For Israel has not been forsaken, nor Judah by his God, by the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.6'>Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORDâ€™S vengeance; he will render unto her a recompense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.7'>Babylon has been a golden cup in the LORDâ€™S hand, that made all the earth drunk: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.8'>Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: wail for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.9'>We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go everyone into his own country: for her judgment reaches unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.10'>The LORD has brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.11'>Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance for his temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.12'>Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD has both purposed and done that which he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.13'>O you that dwell by many waters, abundant in treasures, your end has come, and the measure of your covetousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.14'>The LORD of hosts has sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill you with men, as with locusts; and they shall lift up a shout against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.15'>He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heaven by his understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.16'>When he utters his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth: he makes lightnings with rain, and brings forth the wind out of his storehouses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.17'>Every man is senseless by his knowledge; every goldsmith is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.18'>They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their judgment they shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.19'>The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the maker of all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.20'>You are my battle-axe and weapons of war: for with you will I break in pieces the nations, and with you will I destroy kingdoms;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.21'>And with you will I break in pieces the horse and its rider; and with you will I break in pieces the chariot and its rider;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.23'>I will also break in pieces with you the shepherd and his flock; and with you will I break in pieces the farmer and his yoke of oxen; and with you will I break in pieces captains and rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.24'>And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.25'>Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, says the LORD, who destroy all the earth: and I will stretch out my hand upon you, and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burnt mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.26'>And they shall not take of you a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but you shall be desolate forever, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.27'>Set you up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up like the bristling locusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.28'>Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, their captains, and all their rulers, and all the land of their dominion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.29'>And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.30'>The mighty men of Babylon have ceased to fight, they have remained in their strongholds: their might has failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwelling places; her bars are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.31'>One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every side,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.32'>And that the fords are seized, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.33'>For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.34'>Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me, he has crushed me, he has made me an empty vessel, he has swallowed me up like a monster, he has filled his belly with my delicacies, he has cast me out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.35'>The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.36'>Therefore thus says the LORD; Behold, I will plead your cause, and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.37'>And Babylon shall become a heap, a dwelling place for jackals, an astonishment, and a hissing, without an inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.38'>They shall roar together like lions: they shall growl as lionsâ€™ whelps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.39'>In their excitement I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunk, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.40'>I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with male goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.41'>How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how has Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.42'>The sea has come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of its waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.43'>Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land in which no man dwells, neither does any son of man pass by there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.44'>And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.45'>My people, go you out of the midst of her, and deliver yourselves every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.46'>And lest your heart faint, and you fear for the rumor that shall be heard in the land; a rumor shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumor, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.47'>Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.48'>Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is in them, shall sing for Babylon: for the plunderers shall come unto her from the north, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.49'>As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.50'>You that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.51'>We are ashamed, because we have heard reproach: shame has covered our faces: for strangers have come into the sanctuaries of the LORDâ€™S house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.52'>Therefore, behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will execute judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.53'>Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall plunderers come unto her, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.54'>A sound of a cry comes from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.55'>Because the LORD has plundered Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is raised:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.56'>Because the plunderer has come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, everyone of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompenses shall surely repay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.57'>And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, says the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.58'>Thus says the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labor in vain, and the nations, because of the fire, and they shall be weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.59'>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was the quartermaster.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.60'>So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.61'>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you come to Babylon, and shall see, and shall read all these words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.62'>Then shall you say, O LORD, you have spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.63'>And it shall be, when you have finished reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.64'>And you shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.52'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.1'>Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.2'>And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.3'>For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.4'>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it, and built a siege wall against it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.5'>So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.6'>And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.7'>Then the city wall was broken through, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the kingâ€™s garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.8'>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.9'>Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he pronounced judgment upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.10'>And the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he killed also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.11'>Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.12'>Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, who served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.13'>And burned the house of the LORD, and the kingâ€™s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.14'>And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.15'>Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the rest of the people that remained in the city, and those that had deserted, that deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.16'>But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for farmers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.17'>Also the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the LORD, and the stands, and the bronze sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke, and carried all their bronze to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.18'>The pots also, and the shovels, and the wick trimmers, and the basins, and the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered, they took away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.19'>And the basins, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the pots, and the lamps, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.20'>The two pillars, one sea, and twelve bronze bulls that were under the stands, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.21'>And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and bands of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.22'>And a capital of bronze was upon it; and the height of one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capitals round about, all of bronze. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.23'>And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were a hundred round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.24'>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.25'>He took also out of the city a eunuch, who had charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were the kingâ€™s counsel, who were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.26'>So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.27'>And the king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of its own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.28'>These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.29'>In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.30'>In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.31'>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.32'>And spoke kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.33'>And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.34'>And for his provision, there was a regular ration given him from the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</verse>
