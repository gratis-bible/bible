        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and revealed it by his angel unto his servant John:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>Who bore witness of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loves us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>And has made us a kingdom and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also who pierced him: and all tribes of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, says the Lord, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What you see, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamum, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden lampstands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>And in the midst of the seven lampstands one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girded about the breast with a golden belt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>His head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>And his feet like unto fine bronze, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in its strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>I am he that lives, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive forevermore, Amen; and have the keys of hades and of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things says he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know your works, and your labor, and your patience, and how you can not bear them who are evil: and you have tried them who say they are apostles, and are not, and have found them liars:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>And have endured, and have patience, and for my name's sake have labored, and have not fainted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>Nevertheless I have somewhat against you, because you have left your first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Remember therefore from where you are fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto you quickly, and will remove your lampstand out of its place, except you repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things says the first and the last, who was dead, and is alive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich) and I know the blasphemy of them who say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Fear none of those things which you will suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be faithful unto death, and I will give you a crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches; He that overcomes shall not be hurt of the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write; These things says he who has the sharp sword with two edges;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I know your works and where you dwell, even where Satan's throne is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days when Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>So have you also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Repent; or else I will come unto you quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows except him who receives it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things says the Son of God, who has his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine bronze;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know your works, and love, and service, and faith, and your patience, and your works; and the last to be more than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>Nevertheless I have a few things against you, because you allow that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I gave her time to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say; I will put upon you no other burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>But that which you have already hold fast till I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>And he that overcomes, and keeps my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to pieces: even as I received of my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>And I will give him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things says he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found your works perfect before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore you will not watch, I will come on you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>You have a few names even in Sardis who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He that overcomes, the same shall be clothed in white clothing; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things says he that is holy, he that is true, he that has the key of David, he that opens, and no man shuts; and shuts, and no man opens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>I know your works: behold, I have set before you an open door, and no man can shut it: for you have a little strength, and have kept my word, and have not denied my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because you have kept the word of mypatience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which you have, that no man take your crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>He that overcomes will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things says the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot: I would that you were cold or hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>So then because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because you say, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white clothing, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness does not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hears my voice, and opens the door, I will come in to him, and will eat with him, and he with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father in his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up here, and I will show you things which must be hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>And immediately I was in the spirit; and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a carnelian stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in appearance like unto an emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>And round about the throne were four and twenty thrones: and upon the thrones I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white clothing; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And out of the throne proceeded lightning and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>And the first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had a face as a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And the four living creatures had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And when those living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him that sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>The four and twenty elders fall down before him that is sitting on the throne, and worship him that lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll, and to loose the seals thereof?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the scroll, neither to look thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the scroll, neither to look thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>And one of the elders said unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>And he came and took the scroll out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they sang a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>And have made us unto our God a kingdom and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him that sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that lives forever and ever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four living creatures saying, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on it had a pair of balances in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see you hurt not the oil and the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the living creatures of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little while, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casts its unripe figs, when it is shaken by a mighty wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>And the heavens departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the generals, and the mighty men, and every slave, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>For the great day of his wrath has come; and who shall be able to stand?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.22'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.1'>And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.2'>In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bore twelve manner of fruit, and yielded its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.3'>And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.4'>And they shall see his face; and his name shall be on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.5'>And there shall be no night there; and they need no lamp, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.6'>And he said unto me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.7'>Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.8'>And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.9'>Then he said unto me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of them who keep the words of this book: worship God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.10'>And he said unto me, Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.11'>He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.12'>And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.13'>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.14'>Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.15'>For outside are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loves and makes a lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.16'>I Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.17'>And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is thirsty come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.18'>For I testify unto every man that hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.19'>And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.20'>He who testifies these things says, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.21'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</verse>
