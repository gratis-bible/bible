        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='1Kgs'>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>Therefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>So they sought for a fair young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>And the young woman was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>And his father had not rebuked him at any time in saying, Why have you done so? and he also was a very handsome man; and his mother bore him after Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and invited all his brethren the kingâ€™s sons, and all the men of Judah the kingâ€™s servants:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he invited not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>Therefore Nathan spoke unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith does reign, and David our lord knows it not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>Now therefore come, let me, I pray you, give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Go and get in unto king David, and say unto him, Did not you, my lord, O king, swear unto your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then does Adonijah reign?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>And Bath-sheba bowed, and knelt before the king. And the king said, What would you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>And she said unto him, My lord, you swore by the LORD your God unto your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>And now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and now, my lord the king, you know it not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>And he has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army: but Solomon your servant has he not called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>And you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>For he has gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the kingâ€™s sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>But me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, has he not invited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you have not showed it unto your servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the kingâ€™s presence, and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>And the king swore, and said, As the LORD lives, that has redeemed my soul out of all distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>Even as I swore unto you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my place; even so will I certainly do this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and knelt before to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>Then you shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my place: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king Davidâ€™s mule, and brought him to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>And all the people came up after him, and the people played on flutes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with the sound of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for you are a valiant man, and bring good tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David has made Solomon king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the kingâ€™s mule:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city resounds with it. This is the noise that you have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>And also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>And moreover the kingâ€™s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon: for, lo, he has caught hold of the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to your house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>Now the days of David drew near that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>I go the way of all the earth: be strong therefore, and show yourself a man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>And keep the charge of the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do, and wherever you turn yourself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>That the LORD may continue his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If your children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his belt that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>Do therefore according to your wisdom, and let not his gray head go down to the grave in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at your table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom your brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>And, behold, you have with you Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put you to death with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for you are a wise man, and know what you ought to do unto him; but his gray head bring you down to the grave with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Come you peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto you. And she said, Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>And he said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: however the kingdom has turned about, and has become my brotherâ€™s: for it was his from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>And now I ask one petition of you, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>And he said, Speak, I pray you, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say nay to you,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to be my wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for you unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the kingâ€™s mother; and she sat on his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>Then she said, I desire one small petition of you; I pray you, say not nay to me. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say nay to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>Now therefore, as the LORD lives, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he struck him down so that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, unto your own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because you have been afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, strike him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>And the king said unto him, Do as he has said, and strike him down, and bury him; that you may take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who struck down two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing of it, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his descendants forever: but upon David, and upon his descendants, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace forever from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.34'>So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and struck him down, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.35'>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the place of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.36'>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build you a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth from there anywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.37'>For it shall be, that on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, you shall know for certain that you shall surely die: your blood shall be upon your own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.38'>And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.39'>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants are in Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.40'>And Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.41'>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.42'>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make you to swear by the LORD, and admonished you, saying, Know for a certain, on the day you go out, and travel anywhere, that you shall surely die? and you said unto me, The word that I have heard is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.43'>Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged you with?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.44'>The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which was in your heart, that you did to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return your wickedness upon your own head;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.45'>And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.46'>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who went out, and struck him, so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>And Solomon made a treaty with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaohâ€™s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>However the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: except that he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.5'>In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.6'>And Solomon said, You have shown unto your servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you; and you have kept for him this great kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.7'>And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.8'>And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.27'>And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowlands, for abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.28'>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and Kue: the kingâ€™s merchants received them from Kue at a price.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.18'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.1'>And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.2'>And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And there was a severe famine in Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.3'>And Ahab called Obadiah, who was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.4'>For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.5'>And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: perhaps we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.6'>So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.7'>And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Are you my lord Elijah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.8'>And he answered him, I am: go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.9'>And he said, How have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.10'>As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found you not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.11'>And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.12'>And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from you, that the spirit of the LORD shall carry you I know not where; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he shall slay me: but I your servant fear the LORD from my youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.13'>Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORDâ€™S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.14'>And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.15'>And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.16'>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.17'>And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Are you he that troubles Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.18'>And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your fatherâ€™s house, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and you have followed Baalim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.19'>Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the idol poles four hundred, who eat at Jezebelâ€™s table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.20'>So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.21'>And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long do you halt between two opinions? if the LORD is God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.22'>Then said Eliajah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baalâ€™s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.23'>Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under it: and I will prepare the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.24'>And call you on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answers by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.25'>And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and prepare it first; for you are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.26'>And they took the bullock which was given them, and they prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.27'>And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is busy, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleeps, and must be awaked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.28'>And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.29'>And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.30'>And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.31'>And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be your name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.32'>And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench around the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.33'>And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.34'>And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.35'>And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.36'>And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.37'>Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that you are the LORD God, and that you have turned their heart back again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.38'>Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.39'>And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.40'>And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.41'>And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.42'>So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.43'>And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.44'>And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there arises a little cloud out of the sea, like a manâ€™s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare your chariot, and get you down, that the rain stops you not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.45'>And it came to pass in a little while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.46'>And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.8'>So she wrote letters in Ahabâ€™s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.9'>And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.10'>And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, You did blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.11'>And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.12'>They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.13'>And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, so that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.14'>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.15'>And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.16'>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.17'>And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.18'>Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.19'>And you shall speak unto him, saying, Thus says the LORD, Have you killed, and also taken possession? And you shall speak unto him, saying, Thus says the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.20'>And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found you: because you have sold yourself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.21'>Behold, I will bring evil upon you, and will take away your posterity, and will cut off from Ahab every male, and he that is shut up and left in Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.22'>And will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.23'>And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.24'>He that dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and he that dies in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.25'>But there was none like unto Ahab, who did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.26'>And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.27'>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.28'>And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.29'>See you how Ahab humbles himself before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his sonâ€™s days will I bring the evil upon his house.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.22'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.1'>And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.2'>And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.3'>And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know you that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.4'>And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.5'>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray you, at the word of the LORD today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.6'>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.7'>And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might inquire of him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.8'>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.9'>Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.10'>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in the threshing floor in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.11'>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus says the LORD, With these shall you push the Syrians, until you have consumed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.12'>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the kingâ€™s hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.13'>And the messenger that had gone to call Micaiah spoke unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let your word, I pray you, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.14'>And Micaiah said, As the LORD lives, what the LORD says unto me, that will I speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.15'>So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.16'>And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure you that you tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.17'>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.18'>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.19'>And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.20'>And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.21'>And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.22'>And the LORD said unto him, By what means? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, You shall persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.23'>Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets, and the LORD has spoken evil concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.24'>But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.25'>And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see in that day, when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.26'>And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the kingâ€™s son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.27'>And say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.28'>And Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.29'>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.30'>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put you on your robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.31'>But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, but only with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.32'>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.33'>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.34'>And a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor: therefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the battle; for I am wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.35'>And the battle increased that day: and the king was propped up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at evening: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.36'>And there went a proclamation throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.37'>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.38'>And someone washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according unto the word of the LORD which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.39'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.40'>So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.41'>And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.42'>Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.43'>And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.44'>And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.45'>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he made war, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.46'>And the remnant of the male prostitutes, who remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.47'>There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.48'>Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.49'>Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.50'>And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.51'>Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.52'>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.53'>For he served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.</verse>
