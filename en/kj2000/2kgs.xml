        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.1'>Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.2'>And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.3'>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.4'>Now therefore thus says the LORD, You shall not come down from that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die. And Elijah departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.5'>And when the messengers returned unto him, he said unto them, Why are you now returned ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.6'>And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, return unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus says the LORD, Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore you shall not come down from that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.7'>And he said unto them, What manner of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.8'>And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and wearing a belt of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.9'>Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty men. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of a hill. And he spoke unto him, You man of God, the king has said, Come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.10'>And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty men. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.11'>Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty men. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus has the king said, Come down quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.12'>And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty men. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.13'>And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty men. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray you, let my life, and the life of these fifty men your servants, be precious in your sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.14'>Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in your sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.15'>And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.16'>And he said unto him, Thus says the LORD, Since you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore you shall not come down off that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.17'>So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.18'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.1'>And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.2'>And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they went down to Beth-el.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.3'>And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from over you today? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold your peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.4'>And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.5'>And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from over you today? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold your peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.6'>And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray you, here; for the LORD has sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And they both went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.7'>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view from afar off: and they both stood by the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.8'>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they both went over on dry ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.9'>And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.10'>And he said, You have asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so unto you; but if not, it shall not be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.11'>And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and separated them both; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.12'>And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.13'>He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.14'>And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had struck the waters, they parted to the one side and to the other: and Elisha went over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.15'>And when the sons of the prophets who were from Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.16'>And they said unto him, Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray you, and seek your master: lest peradventure the spirit of the LORD has taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, You shall not send them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.17'>And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send them. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.18'>And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.19'>And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water is bad, and the ground barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.20'>And he said, Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it. And they brought it to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.21'>And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus says the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or barren land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.22'>So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.23'>And he went up from there unto Beth-el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth youths out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, you bald head; go up, you bald head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.24'>And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two of the youths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.25'>And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.1'>Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.2'>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.3'>Nevertheless he clung unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.4'>And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and rendered unto the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, with the wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.5'>But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.6'>And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.7'>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: will you go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as you are, my people as your people, and my horses as your horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.8'>And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.9'>So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they made a circuit of seven daysâ€™ journey: and there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.10'>And the king of Israel said, Alas! the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.11'>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israelâ€™s servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.12'>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.13'>And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? get you to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.14'>And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.15'>But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.16'>And he said, Thus says the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.17'>For thus says the LORD, You shall not see wind, neither shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that you may drink, both you, and your cattle, and your animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.18'>And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.19'>And you shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall cut down every good tree, and stop up all wells of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.20'>And it came to pass in the morning, when the grain offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.21'>And when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armor, and older, and stood in the border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.22'>And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.23'>And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.24'>And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck down the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.25'>And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and covered it; and they stopped up all the wells of water, and cut down all the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth left they its stones; the slingers surrounded it, and conquered it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.26'>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.27'>Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there came great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.1'>Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor has come to take unto him my two sons to be slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.2'>And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for you? tell me, what have you in the house? And she said, Your handmaid has not anything in the house, except a pot of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.3'>Then he said, Go, borrow you vessels outside of all your neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.4'>And when you are come in, you shall shut the door upon you and upon your sons, and shall pour out into all those vessels, and you shall set aside that which is full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.5'>So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.6'>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stopped flowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.7'>Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and live you and your children from the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.8'>And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where there was a wealthy woman; and she urged him to eat some food. And so it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat some food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.9'>And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who passes by us continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.10'>Let us make a little chamber, I pray you, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a lampstand: and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.11'>And it fell on a day, that he came there, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.12'>And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.13'>And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, you have cared for us with all this care; what is to be done for you? would you be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.14'>And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she has no child, and her husband is old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.15'>And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.16'>And he said, About this season, next year, you shall embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, you man of God, do not lie unto your handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.17'>And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that time that Elisha had said unto her, according to the appointed time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.18'>And when the child was grown, on a certain day, he went out to his father to the reapers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.19'>And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.20'>And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.21'>And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.22'>And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray you, one of the young men, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.23'>And he said, Why will you go to him today? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.24'>Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not your riding for me, except I bid you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.25'>So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.26'>Run now, I pray you, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with you? is it well with your husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.27'>And when she came to the man of God at the mountain, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is bitter within her: and the LORD has hid it from me, and has not told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.28'>Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.29'>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, greet him not; and if any greet you, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.30'>And the mother of the child said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And he arose, and followed her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.31'>And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child has not awakened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.32'>And when Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.33'>He went in therefore, and shut the door upon the two of them, and prayed unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.34'>And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child became warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.35'>Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.36'>And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up your son.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.1'>Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valor, but he was a leper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.2'>And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naamanâ€™s wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.3'>And she said unto her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would cure him of his leprosy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.4'>And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.5'>And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.6'>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto you, behold, I have with it sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may cure him of his leprosy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.7'>And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man does send unto me to cure a man of his leprosy? therefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.8'>And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have you torn your clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.9'>So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.10'>And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.12'>Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.13'>And his servants came near, and spoke unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid you do some great thing, would you not have done it? how much rather then, when he says to you, Wash, and be clean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.14'>Then he went down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh was restored again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.15'>And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a blessing from your servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.16'>But he said, As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.17'>And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray you, be given to your servant two mulesâ€™ burden of earth? for your servant will never offer either burnt offering or sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.18'>In this thing the LORD pardon your servant, that when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.19'>And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.20'>But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving from his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD lives, I will run after him, and take something from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.21'>So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.22'>And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there has come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray you, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.23'>And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bore them before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.24'>And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and put them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.25'>But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, From where come you, Gehazi? And he said, Your servant went nowhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.26'>And he said unto him, Went not my heart with you, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.27'>The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cling unto you, and unto your descendants forever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.7'>Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.14'>Nevertheless they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.15'>And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.16'>And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an idol pole and worshiped all the army of heaven, and served Baal.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.25'>And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.26'>Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which you have removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he has sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.27'>Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Send there one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.28'>Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.29'>However every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they dwelt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.30'>And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.32'>So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.33'>They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.34'>Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they follow their statutes, or their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.35'>With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, You shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.41'>So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their childrenâ€™s children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.13'>And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the LORD, and the stands, and the bronze sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried their bronze to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.14'>And the pots, and the shovels, and the wick trimmers, and the ladles, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered, they took away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.15'>And the firepans, and the basins, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.16'>The two pillars, one sea, and the stands which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.17'>The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital upon it was bronze: and the height of the capital three cubits; and the network, and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of bronze: and like unto these the second pillar with a network.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.18'>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.19'>And out of the city he took an officer that was in charge over the men of war, and five men of them that had been in the kingâ€™s presence, who were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the army, who mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.20'>And Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.21'>And the king of Babylon struck them down, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.23'>And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maacathite, they and their men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.24'>And Gedaliah swore to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.</verse>
