        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.1'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib: but Israel does not know, my people do not consider.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a descendant of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they have turned away backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>Why should you be stricken any more? you will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither soothed with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a hut in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>Unless the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? says the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of male goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>When you come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>Bring no more vain offerings; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot endure; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary of bearing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yea, when you make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>Wash you, make yourself clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>Learn to do good; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>Come now, and let us reason together, says the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'>If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'>But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'>How has the faithful city become a harlot! it was full of justice; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>Therefore says the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will rid myself of my adversaries, and avenge myself of my enemies:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>And I will turn my hand upon you, and thoroughly purge away your dross, and take away all your alloy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning: afterward you shall be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>For you shall be ashamed of the sacred oaks which you have desired, and you shall be embarrassed for the gardens that you have chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>And the strong shall be as tinder, and the work of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'>And many people shall go and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>And he shall judge between the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>O house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>Therefore you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob, because they are filled with customs from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they make bargains with the children of aliens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'>Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>And man bows down, and the great man humbles himself: therefore forgive them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>For the day of the LORD of hosts shall come upon everyone that is proud and lofty, and upon everyone that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>And upon every high tower, and upon every fortified wall,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all beautiful vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'>And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'>And the idols he shall utterly abolish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'>And they shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake mightily the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'>In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made, each for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'>To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake mightily the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'>Turn away from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for of what account is he?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'>For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, does take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stock and the store, the whole supply of bread, and the whole supply of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'>The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the elder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'>The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and the skilled craftsman, and the eloquent orator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'>And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'>And the people shall be oppressed, everyone by another, and everyone by his neighbor: the child shall behave himself proudly against the elder, and the base against the honorable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'>When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, you have clothing, be our ruler, and let this ruin be under your hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'>In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their deeds are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'>The look on their countenance does witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have brought evil unto themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'>Say you to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'>Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they who lead you cause you to err, and destroy the way of your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'>The LORD stands up to plead, and stands to judge the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'>The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and its princes: For you have eaten up the vineyard; the plunder of the poor is in your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'>What do you mean that you beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? says the Lord GOD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'>Moreover the LORD says, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and tripping as they go, and making a jingling with their feet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'>Therefore the Lord will strike with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will uncover their secret parts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'>In that day the Lord will take away the finery of their jingling ornaments about their ankles, and their scarves, and their crescents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'>The pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'>The headdresses, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the perfume boxes, and the charms,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'>The rings, and nose rings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.22'>The festal robes, and the mantles, and the cloaks, and the handbags,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'>The mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the veils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'>And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet fragrance there shall be a stench; and instead of a sash, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth; and a burning scar instead of beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'>Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty men in the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'>And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'>And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by your name, to take away our reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'>In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and splendid for them that have escaped of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'>And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone that is recorded among the living in Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.4'>When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from its midst by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.5'>And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a covering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.6'>And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a shelter from storm and from rain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'>Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved regarding his vineyard. My well-beloved has a vineyard on a very fruitful hill:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'>And he dug it, and gathered out its stones, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress in it: and he expected that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? why, when I expected that it should bring forth grapes, it brought forth wild grapes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'>And now; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up; and break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'>And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor dug; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'>For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for justice, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'>Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may dwell alone in the midst of the earth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'>In my hearing said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'>Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'>Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflames them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'>And the harp, and the lyre, the timbrel, and flute, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'>Therefore my people have gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'>Therefore sheol has enlarged itself, and opened its mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that exults, shall descend into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'>And man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'>But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in justice, and God who is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'>Then shall the lambs feed in their pasture, and the waste places of the rich ones shall strangers eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'>Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'>That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.20'>Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.21'>Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.22'>Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mix strong drink:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'>Who justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the justice of the righteous from him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'>Therefore as the fire devours the stubble, and the flame consumes the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have rejected the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'>Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has stricken them: and the hills did tremble, and their dead bodies were as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'>And he will lift up a banner to the nations from afar, and will whistle unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed, swiftly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'>None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the belt on their waist be loosed, nor the strap of their shoes be broken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'>Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'>Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safely, and none shall deliver it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'>And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one looks unto the land, behold, darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in its heavens.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'>Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.3'>And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.4'>And the posts of the door were shaken at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.5'>Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.6'>Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.7'>And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.8'>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.9'>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but understand not; and see you indeed, but perceive not.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.22.1'>The burden concerning the valley of vision. What ails you now, that you are wholly gone up to the housetops?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.2'>You that are full of shoutings, a tumultuous city, a joyous city: your slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.3'>All your rulers have fled together, they are captured by the archers: all that are found in you are bound together, who have fled from afar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.4'>Therefore said I, Look away from me: I will weep bitterly, labor not to comfort me, because of the plundering of the daughter of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.5'>For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.6'>And Elam bore the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.7'>And it shall come to pass, that your choicest valleys shall be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.8'>And he took away the covering of Judah, and you did look in that day to the armor of the house of the forest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.9'>You have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are many: and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.10'>And you have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have you broken down to fortify the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.11'>You made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but you have not looked unto its maker, neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.12'>And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call for weeping, and for mourning, and for baldness, and for girding with sackcloth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.13'>But instead, joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating meat, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.14'>And it was revealed in my ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till you die, says the Lord GOD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.15'>Thus says the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get you unto this steward, even unto Shebna, who is over the house, and say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.16'>What have you here? and whom have you here, that you have hewed you out a sepulcher here, as he that hews him out a sepulcher on high, and that carves a tomb for himself in a rock?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.17'>Behold, the LORD will carry you away with a mighty captivity, and will surely seize you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.18'>He will surely violently turn and toss you like a ball into a large country: there shall you die, and there the chariots of your glory shall be the shame of your masterâ€™s house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.19'>And I will drive you from your office, and from your station shall he pull you down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.20'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.21'>And I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt, and I will commit your authority into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.22'>And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.23'>And I will fasten him as a peg in a sure place; and he shall become a glorious throne to his father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.24'>And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the posterity, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of pitchers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.22.25'>In that day, says the LORD of hosts, shall the peg that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for the LORD has spoken it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.23.1'>The burden concerning Tyre. Wail, you ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.2'>Be still, you inhabitants of the coast; you whom the merchants of Sidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.3'>And by great waters the grain of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a marketplace of nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.4'>Be ashamed, O Sidon: for the sea has spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.5'>As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be greatly pained at the report of Tyre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.6'>Pass over to Tarshish; wail, you inhabitants of the coast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.7'>Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her own feet shall carry her afar off to dwell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.8'>Who has taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are the honorable of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.9'>The LORD of hosts has purposed it, to defile the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.10'>Pass through your land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is no more strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.11'>He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the LORD has given a commandment against Canaan, to destroy its strongholds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.12'>And he said, You shall no more rejoice, O you oppressed virgin, daughter of Sidon: arise, pass over to Kittim; there also shall you have no rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.13'>Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up its towers, they raised up its palaces; and he brought it to ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.14'>Wail, you ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.15'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years it shall happen to Tyre as in the song of a harlot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.16'>Take an harp, go about the city, you harlot that has been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that you may be remembered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.17'>And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.23.18'>And her merchandise and her hire shall be dedicated to the LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for fine clothing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.24.1'>Behold, the LORD makes the earth empty, and makes it waste, and turns it upside down, and scatters abroad its inhabitants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.2'>And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the debtor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.3'>The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly plundered: for the LORD has spoken this word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.4'>The earth mourns and fades away, the world languishes and fades away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.5'>The earth also is defiled under its inhabitants; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.6'>Therefore has the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell in it are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.24.9'>They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.10'>The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.11'>There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.12'>In the city is left desolation, and the gate is stricken with destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.13'>When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, there shall be like the shaking of an olive tree, and like the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.14'>They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.15'>Therefore glorify the LORD in the east, even the name of the LORD God of Israel in the coastlands of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.16'>From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.17'>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.18'>And it shall come to pass, that he who flees from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that comes up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.19'>The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is torn asunder, the earth is shaken exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.20'>The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a hut; and its transgression shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.21'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the exalted ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.22'>And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.24.23'>Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his elders gloriously.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.25.1'>O LORD, you are my God; I will exalt you, I will praise your name; for you have done wonderful things; your counsels of old are faithfulness and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.25.2'>For you have made of a city a heap; of a fortified city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.25.3'>Therefore shall the strong people glorify you, the city of the terrible nations shall fear you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.25.4'>For you have been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, for the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.25.5'>You shall bring down the noise of aliens, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the song of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.25.6'>And on this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of rich things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.25.10'>For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the refuse heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.25.11'>And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swims spreads forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the trickery of their hands.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.61.8'>For I the LORD love justice, I hate robbery with a burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.9'>And their descendants shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the descendants whom the LORD has blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.10'>I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.11'>For as the earth brings forth its bud, and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.65.7'>Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says the LORD, who have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.8'>Thus says the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.9'>And I will bring forth a descendant out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and my elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.65.12'>Therefore will I number you to the sword, and you shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not hear; but did evil before my eyes, and did choose that in which I delighted not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.13'>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be ashamed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.14'>Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for anguish of spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.65.22'>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.66'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.1'>Thus says the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that you build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.2'>For all those things has my hand made, and all those things have been, says the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembles at my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.3'>He that kills an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrifices a lamb, as if he breaks a dog's neck; he that offers a grain offering, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burns incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.4'>I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did evil before my eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.5'>Hear the word of the LORD, you that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.6'>A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that renders recompense to his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.7'>Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.8'>Who has heard such a thing? who has seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.9'>Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? says the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? says your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.10'>Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you that mourn for her:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.11'>That you may nurse, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that you may drink deeply, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.12'>For thus says the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall you nurse, you shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.13'>As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.14'>And when you see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the grass: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.15'>For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.16'>For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.17'>They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens following one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.18'>For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.19'>And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those of them that escape unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the coastlands afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.20'>And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon camels, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.21'>And I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.22'>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says the LORD, so shall your descendants and your name remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.23'>And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.24'>And they shall go forth, and look upon the corpses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence unto all flesh.</verse>
