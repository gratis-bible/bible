        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

        <verse osisID='Lev.26.31'>And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the aroma of your sweet odors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.32'>And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies who dwell therein shall be astonished at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.33'>And I will scatter you among the nations, and will draw out a sword after you: and yourland shall be desolate, and your cities waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.34'>Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.35'>As long as it lies desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when you dwelt upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.36'>And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursues.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.26.41'>And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.42'>Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.43'>The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lies desolate without them: and they shall accept the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.44'>And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.45'>But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lev.27'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.1'>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.2'>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a special vow of persons to the LORD at your valuation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.3'>Then your valuation shall be for the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.4'>And if it be a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.5'>And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then your valuation shall be for the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.6'>And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then your valuation shall be for the male five shekels of silver, and for the female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.7'>And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.8'>But if he is too poor to pay your valuation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.9'>And if it be an animal, of which men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man gives of such unto the LORD shall be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.10'>He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change animal for animal, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.11'>And if it be any unclean animal, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the animal before the priest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.12'>And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as you value it, who are the priest, so shall it be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.13'>But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto your valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.14'>And when a man shall dedicate his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.15'>And if he that dedicates it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation unto it, and it shall be his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.16'>And if a man shall dedicate unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seed from it: ahomer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.17'>If he dedicates his field from the year of jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.18'>But if he dedicates his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money due according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubilee, and it shall be deducted from your valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.19'>And if he that dedicates the field will at any time redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation unto it, and it shall belong to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.20'>And if he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.21'>But the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.22'>And if a man dedicates unto the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.23'>Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of your valuation, even up to the year of the jubilee: and he shall give your valuation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.24'>In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.25'>And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.26'>Only the firstling of the animals, which should be the LORD'S firstling, no man may dedicate it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD'S.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.27'>And if it be of an unclean animal, then he shall redeem it according to your valuation, and shall add a fifth part to it: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.28'>Nevertheless no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he has, both of man and animal, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.29'>No one devoted to destruction, who shall be devoted among men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.30'>And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S: it is holy unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.31'>And if a man will at all redeem any of his tithes, he shall add to it the fifth part thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.32'>And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.33'>He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he changes it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.34'>These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel on mount Sinai.</verse>
