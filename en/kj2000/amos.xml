        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Amos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.1'>The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.2'>And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.3'>Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.4'>But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.5'>I will break also the gate of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holds the scepter from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.6'>Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.7'>But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour its palaces:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.8'>And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holds the scepter from Ashkelon, and I will turn my hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, says the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.9'>Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.10'>But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, which shall devour its palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.11'>Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath forever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.12'>But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.13'>Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they have ripped up the women with child in Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.14'>But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour its palaces, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.15'>And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, says the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.1'>Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.2'>But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.3'>And I will cut off the judge from its midst, and will slay all its princes with him, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.4'>Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after which their fathers have walked:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.5'>But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.6'>Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.7'>That trample on the dust of the earth which is on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the same maiden, to defile my holy name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.8'>And they lay themselves down upon clothes taken in pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.9'>Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.10'>Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.11'>And I raised up some of your sons for prophets, and some of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O you children of Israel? says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.12'>But you gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.13'>Behold, I am weighted down under you, as a cart is weighted down that is full of sheaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.14'>Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his power, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.15'>Neither shall he stand that handles the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rides the horse deliver himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.16'>And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, says the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.1'>Hear this word that the LORD has spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.2'>You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.3'>Can two walk together, except they are agreed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.4'>Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? will a young lion cry out from his den, if he has taken nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.5'>Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no trap is for it? shall one take up a snare from the earth, having taken nothing at all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.6'>Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be calamity in a city, and the LORD has not done it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.7'>Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, unless he reveals his secret unto his servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.8'>The lion has roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD has spoken, who can but prophesy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.9'>Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in its midst, and the oppressed in its midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.10'>For they know not to do right, says the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.11'>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be even all around the land; and he shall bring down your strength from you, and your palaces shall be plundered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.12'>Thus says the LORD; As the shepherd takes out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and on the edge of a couch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.13'>Hear you, and testify in the house of Jacob, says the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.14'>That in the day that I shall punish the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also punish the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.15'>And I will strike the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, says the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.1'>Hear this word, you cows of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.2'>The Lord GOD has sworn by his holiness: Lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.3'>And you shall go out through the breaches, every cow straight before her; and you shall cast them into the palace, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.4'>Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.5'>And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this you love, O you children of Israel, says the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.6'>And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places: yet have you not returned unto me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.7'>And also I have withheld the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one part was rained upon, and the part upon which it rained not withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.8'>So two or three cities wandered to one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have you not returned unto me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.9'>I have smitten you with blight and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the locust devoured them: yet have you not returned unto me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.10'>I have sent among you a plague after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stench of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have you not returned unto me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.11'>I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have you not returned unto me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.12'>Therefore thus will I do unto you, O Israel: and because I will do this unto you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.13'>For, lo, he that forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares unto man what is his thought, that makes the morning darkness, and treads upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.1'>Hear you this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.2'>The virgin of Israel has fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.3'>For thus says the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall have left a hundred, and that which went forth by a hundred shall have left ten, to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.4'>For thus says the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek me, and you shall live:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.5'>But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.6'>Seek the LORD, and you shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.7'>You who turn justice to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.8'>Seek him that makes the seven stars and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the day dark with night: that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.9'>That strengthens the plundered against the strong, so that the plundered shall come against the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.10'>They hate him that rebukes in the gate, and they abhor him that speaks uprightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.11'>Since therefore you tread upon the poor, and you take from him burdens of wheat: you have built houses of hewn stone, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted pleasant vineyards, but you shall not drink wine of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.12'>For I know your manifold transgressions, and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.13'>Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.14'>Seek good, and not evil, that you may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as you have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.15'>Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.16'>Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, says thus: Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the farmer to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to wailing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.17'>And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through you, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.18'>Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.19'>As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.20'>Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.21'>I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not take delight in your solemn assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.22'>Though you offer me burnt offerings and your grain offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fatted beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.23'>Take away from me the noise of your songs; for I will not hear the melody of your harps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.24'>But let justice run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.25'>Have you offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.26'>But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch, and Chiun your star god, your images, which you made for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.27'>Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, says the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.1'>Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, who are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.2'>Pass you unto Calneh, and see; and from there go to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: are they better than these kingdoms? or their borders greater than your borders?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.3'>You that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.4'>That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch yourselves upon your couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.5'>That chant to the sound of the harp, and invent for yourselves instruments of music, like David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.6'>That drink wine in bowls, and anoint yourselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.7'>Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.8'>The Lord GOD has sworn by himself, says the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.9'>And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.10'>And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burns him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with you? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold your tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.11'>For, behold, the LORD commands, and he will strike the great house into pieces, and the little house into bits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.12'>Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for you have turned justice into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.13'>You rejoice in a thing of nothing, who say, Have we not taken to us authority by our own strength?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.14'>But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, says the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entrance of Hamath unto the river of Arabah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.1'>Thus has the Lord GOD showed unto me; and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.2'>And it came to pass, that when they had finished eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech you: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.3'>The LORD relented concerning this: It shall not be, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.4'>Thus has the Lord GOD showed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called for judgment by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.5'>Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech you: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.6'>The LORD relented concerning this: This also shall not be, says the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.7'>Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.8'>And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what see you? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them anymore:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.9'>And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.10'>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.11'>For thus Amos says, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.12'>Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O you seer, go, flee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.13'>But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is the king's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.14'>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was a herdsman, and a gatherer of sycamore fruit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.15'>And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.16'>Now therefore hear you the word of the LORD: you say, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not your word against the house of Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.17'>Therefore thus says the LORD; Your wife shall be a harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by a survey line; and you shall die in a defiled land: and Israel shall surely go forth into captivity from his land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.1'>Thus has the Lord GOD showed unto me: and behold a basket of summer fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.2'>And he said, Amos, what see you? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end has come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.3'>And the songs of the temple shall be wailings in that day, says the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth in silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.4'>Hear this, O you that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.5'>Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.6'>That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.7'>The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.8.11'>Behold, the days come, says the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.12'>And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.8.14'>They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Your god, O Dan, lives; and, The way of Beersheba lives; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.9.1'>I saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Strike the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and break them on the heads of all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that flees of them shall not flee away, and he that escapes of them shall not be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.2'>Though they dig into sheol, there shall my hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, there will I bring them down:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.3'>And though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, I will search and take them from there; and though they are hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.4'>And though they go into captivity before their enemies, there will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set my eyes upon them for harm, and not for good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.5'>And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that touches the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell in it shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like the river; and shall be drowned, as by the river of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.6'>It is he that builds his chambers in the heavens, and has founded his vault upon the earth; he that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.7'>Are you not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? says the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.8'>Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.9'>For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like grain is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.9.12'>That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the nations, who are called by my name, says the LORD that does this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.13'>Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that sows seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall flow with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.14'>And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall rebuild the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink their wine; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.15'>And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, says the LORD your God.</verse>
