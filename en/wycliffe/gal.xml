Poul the apostle, not of men, ne bi man, but bi Jhesu Crist, and God the fadir,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>
that reiside hym fro deth, and alle the britheren that ben with me, to the chirchis of Galathie,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>
grace to you and pees of God the fadir, and of the Lord Jhesu Crist,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>
that yaf hym silf for oure synnes, to delyuere vs fro the present wickid world, bi the wille of God and of oure fadir,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>
to whom is worschip and glorie in to worldis of worldis. Amen.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>
I wondur, that so soone ye be thus moued fro hym that clepid you in to the grace of Crist, in to another euangelie; which is not anothir,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>
but that ther ben summe that troublen you, and wolen mysturne the euangelie of Crist.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>
But thouy we, or an aungel of heuene, prechide to you, bisidis that that we han prechid to you, be he acursid.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>
As Y haue seid bifore, and now eftsoones Y seie, if ony preche to you bisidis that that ye han vndurfongun, be he cursid.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>
For now whether counsele Y men, or God? or whether Y seche to plese men? If Y pleside yit men, Y were not Cristis seruaunt.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>
For, britheren, Y make knowun to you the euangelie, that was prechid of me, for it is not bi man;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>
ne Y took it of man, ne lernyde, but bi reuelacioun of Jhesu Crist.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>
For ye han herd my conuersacioun sumtyme in the Jurie, and that Y pursuede passyngli the chirche of God, and fauyt ayen it.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>
And Y profitide in the Jurie aboue many of myn eueneldis in my kynrede, and was more aboundauntli a folewere of my fadris tradiciouns.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>
But whanne it pleside hym, that departide me fro my modir wombe,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>
and clepide bi his grace, to schewe his sone in me, that Y schulde preche hym among the hethene, anoon Y drowy me not to fleisch and blood; ne Y cam to Jerusalem to the apostlis,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>
that weren tofor me, but Y wente in to Arabie, and eftsoones Y turnede ayen in to Damask.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>
And sith thre yeer aftir Y cam to Jerusalem, to se Petre, and Y dwellide with hym fiftene daies;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>
but Y sawy noon othere of the apostlis, but James, oure Lordis brother.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>
And these thingis which Y write to you, lo! tofor God Y lie not.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>
Afterward Y cam in to the coostis of Syrie and Cilicie.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>
But Y was vnknowun bi face to the chirchis of Judee, that weren in Crist; and thei hadden oonli an heryng,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>
that he that pursuede vs sum tyme, prechide now the feith, ayens which he fauyte sum tyme;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>
and in me thei glorifieden God.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>
And sith fourtene yeer aftir, eftsones Y wente vp to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took with me Tite.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>
Y wente vp bi reuelacioun, and spak with hem the euangelie, which Y preche among the hethene; and bi hem silf to these that semeden to be sumwhat, lest Y runne, or hadde runne in veyne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>
And nother Tite, that hadde be with me, while he was hethene, was compellid to be circumsidid;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>
but for false britheren that weren brouyt ynne, whiche hadden entrid to aspie oure fredom, which we han in Jhesu Crist, to bring vs in to seruage.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>
But we yyue no place to subieccioun, that the treuthe of the gospel schulde dwelle with you.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>
But of these that semeden to be sumwhat; whiche thei weren sum tyme, it perteyneth not to me, for God takith not the persoone of man; for thei that semeden to be sumwhat, yauen me no thing.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>
But ayenward, whanne thei hadden seyn, that the euangelie of prepucie was youun to me, as the euangelie of circumcisioun was youun to Petre;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>
for he that wrouyte to Petre in apostlehed of circumcisioun, wrouyte also to me among the hethene;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>
and whanne thei hadden knowe the grace of God, that was youun to me, James, and Petre, and Joon, whiche weren seyn to be the pileris, thei yauen riythond of felowschip to me and to Barnabas, that we among the hethene, and thei in to circumcisioun;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>
oneli that we hadde mynde of pore men `of Crist, the which thing Y was ful bisi to doon.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>
But whanne Petre was comun to Antioche, Y ayenstood hym in the face, for he was worthi to be vndirnommen.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>
For bifor that ther camen summen fro James, he eete with the hethene men; but whanne thei weren comun, he withdrowy, and departide hym, dredinge hem that weren of circumcisioun.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>
And the othere Jewis assentiden to his feynyng, so that Barnabas was drawun of hem in to that feynyng.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>
But whanne Y sawy, that thei walkiden not riytli to the treuthe of the gospel, Y seide to Petre bifor alle men, If thou, that art a Jew, lyuest hethenlich, and not Jewelich, hou constreynest thou hethene men to bicome Jewis?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>
We Jewis of kynde, and not synful men of the hethene,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>
knowen that a man is not iustified of the werkis of lawe, but bi the feith of Jhesu Crist; and we bileuen in Jhesu Crist, that we ben iustified of the feith of Crist, and not of the werkis of lawe. Wherfor of the werkis of lawe ech fleisch schal not be iustified.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>
And if we sechen to be iustified in Crist, we oure silf ben foundun synful men, whether Crist be mynystre of synne?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>
God forbede. And if Y bylde ayen thingis that Y haue distruyed, Y make my silf a trespassour.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>
For bi the lawe Y am deed to the lawe, and Y am fitchid to the crosse, that Y lyue to God with Crist.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>
And now lyue not Y, but Crist lyueth in me. But that Y lyue now in fleisch, Y lyue in the feith of Goddis sone, that louede me, and yaf hym silf for me.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>
Y caste not awey the grace of God; for if riytwisnesse be thoruy lawe, thanne Crist diede with out cause.

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>
Vnwitti Galathies, tofor whos iyen Jhesu Crist is exilid, and is crucified in you, who hath disseyued you, that ye obeyen not to treuthe?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>
This oneli Y wilne to lerne of you, whether ye han vndurfonge the spirit of werkis of the lawe, or of heryng of bileue?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>
So ye ben foolis, that whanne ye han bigunne in spirit, ye ben endid in fleisch.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>
So grete thingis ye han suffrid without cause, if it be withoute cause.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>
He that yyueth to you spirit, and worchith vertues in you, whether of werkis of the lawe, or of hering of bileue?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>
As it is writun, Abraham bileuede to God, and it was rettid to hym to riytfulnesse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>
And therfor knowe ye, that these that ben of bileue, ben the sones of Abraham.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>
And the scripture seynge afer, that God iustifieth the hethene, of bileue told tofor to Abraham, That in thee alle the hethene schulen be blessid.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>
And therfor these that ben of bileue, schulen be blessid with feithful Abraham.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>
For alle that ben of the werkis of the lawe, ben vndur curse; for it is writun, Ech man is cursid, that abidith not in alle thingis that ben writun in the book of the lawe, to do tho thingis.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>
And that no man is iustified in the lawe bifor God, it is opyn, for a riytful man lyueth of bileue.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>
But the lawe is not of bileue, but he that doith tho thingis of the lawe, schal lyue in hem.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>
But Crist ayenbouyte us fro the curse of the lawe, and was maad acursid for vs; for it is writun, Ech man is cursid that hangith in the tre;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>
that among the hethene the blessyng of Abraham were maad in `Crist Jhesu, that we vndurfonge the biheeste of spirit thoruy bileue.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>
Britheren, Y seie aftir man, no man dispisith the testament of a man that is confermed, or ordeyneth aboue.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>
The biheestis weren seid to Abraham and to his seed; he seith not, In seedis, as in many, but as in oon, And to thi seed, that is, Crist.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>
But Y seie, this testament is confermed of God; the lawe that was maad after foure hundrid and thritti yeer, makith not the testament veyn to auoide awei the biheest.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>
For if eritage were of the lawe, it were not now of biheeste. But God grauntide to Abraham thoruy biheest.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>
What thanne the lawe? It was sett for trespassing, to the seed come, to whom he hadde maad his biheest. Whiche lawe was ordeyned bi aungels, in the hoond of a mediatour. But a mediatour is not of oon. But God is oon.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>
Is thanne the lawe ayens the biheestis of God? God forbede. For if the lawe were youun, that myyte quikene, verili were riytfulnesse of lawe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>
But scripture hath concludid alle thingis vndir synne, that the biheeste of the feith of Jhesu Crist were yyuen to hem that bileuen.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>
And tofor that bileue cam, thei weren kept vndur the lawe, enclosid in to that bileue that was to be schewid.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>
And so the lawe was oure vndirsmaister in Crist, that we ben iustified of bileue.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>
But aftir that bileue cam, we ben not now vndur the vndurmaistir.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>
For alle ye ben the children of God thoruy the bileue of Jhesu Crist.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>
For alle ye that ben baptisid, ben clothid with Crist.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>
Ther is no Jewe, ne Greke, ne bond man, ne fre man, ne male, ne female; for alle ye ben oon in `Jhesu Crist.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>
And if ye ben oon in `Jhesu Crist, thanne ye ben the seed of Abraham, and eiris bi biheest.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>
But Y seie, as long tyme as the eir is a litil child, he dyuersith no thing fro a seruaunt, whanne he is lord of alle thingis;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>
but he is vndur keperis and tutoris, in to the tyme determyned of the fadir.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>
So we, whanne we weren litle children, we serueden vndur the elementis of the world.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>
But aftir that the fulfilling of tyme cam, God sente his sone,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>
maad of a womman, maad vndur the lawe, that he schulde ayenbie hem that weren vndur the lawe, that we schulden vnderfonge the adopcioun of sones.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>
And for ye ben Goddis sones, God sente his spirit in to youre hertis, criynge, Abba, fadir.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>
And so ther is not now a seruaunt, but a sone; and if he is a sone, he is an eir bi God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>
But thanne ye vnknowynge God, serueden to hem that in kynde weren not goddis.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>
But now whanne ye han knowe God, and ben knowun of God, hou ben ye turned eftsoone to the febil and nedi elementis, to the whiche ye wolen eft serue?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>
Ye taken kepe to daies, and monethis, and tymes, and yeris.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>
But Y drede you, lest without cause Y haue trauelid among you.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>
Be ye as Y, for Y am as ye. Britheren, Y biseche you, ye han hurt me no thing.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>
But ye knowen, that bi infirmyte of fleisch Y haue prechid to you now bifore;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>
and ye dispiseden not, nether forsoken youre temptacioun in my fleisch, but ye resseyueden me as an aungel of God, as `Crist Jhesu.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>
Where thanne is youre blessyng? For Y bere you witnesse, that if it myyte haue be don. ye wolden haue put out youre iyen, and haue yyuen hem to me.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>
Am Y thanne maad an enemye to you, seiynge to you the sothe?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>
Thei louen not you wel, but thei wolen exclude you, that ye suen hem.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>
But sue ye the good euermore in good, and not oneli whanne Y am present with you.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>
My smale children, whiche Y bere eftsoones, til that Crist be fourmed in you,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>
and Y wolde now be at you, and chaunge my vois, for Y am confoundid among you.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>
Seie to me, ye that wolen be vndir the lawe, `han ye not red the lawe?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>
For it is writun, that Abraham hadde two sones, oon of a seruaunt, and oon of a fre womman.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>
But he that was of the seruaunt, was borun after the flesh; but he that was of the fre womman, by a biheeste.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>
The whiche thingis ben seid bi an othir vndirstonding. For these ben two testamentis; oon in the hille of Synai, gendringe in to seruage, which is Agar.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>
For Syna is an hille that is in Arabie, which hille is ioyned to it that is now Jerusalem, and seruith with hir children.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>
But that Jerusalem that is aboue, is fre, whiche is oure modir.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>
For it is writun, Be glad, thou bareyn, that berist not; breke out and crye, that bringist forth no children; for many sones ben of hir that is left of hir hosebonde, more than of hir that hath an hosebonde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>
For, britheren, we ben sones of biheeste aftir Isaac;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>
but now as this that was borun after the fleisch pursuede him that was aftir the spirit, so now.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>
But what seith the scripture? Caste out the seruaunt and hir sone, for the sone of the seruaunt schal not be eir with the sone of the fre wijf.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>
And so, britheren, we ben not sones of the seruaunt, but of the fre wijf, bi which fredom Crist hath maad vs fre.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>
Stonde ye therfor, and nyl ye eftsoones be holdun in the yok of seruage.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>
Lo! Y Poul seie to you, that if ye ben circumcidid, Crist schal no thing profite to you.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>
And Y witnesse eftsoones to ech man that circumcidith hym silf, that he is dettour of al the lawe to be don.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>
And ye ben voidid awei fro Crist, and ye that be iustified in the lawe, ye han fallen awei fro grace.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>
For we thoruy the spirit of bileue abiden the hope of riytfulnesse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>
For in Jhesu Crist nether circumcisioun is ony thing worth, nether prepucie, but the bileue that worchith bi charite.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>
Ye runnen wel; who lettide you that ye obeyede not to treuthe?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>
Consente ye to no man; for this counsel ys not of hym that hath clepid you.

        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>
A litil souredowy apeirith al the gobet.

        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>
I trust on you in oure Lord, that ye schulden vndurstonde noon other thing. And who that disturblith you, schal bere dom, who euere he be.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>
And, britheren, if Y preche yit circumcisioun, what suffre Y yit persecucioun? thanne the sclaundre of the crosse is auoidid.

Y wolde that thei weren cut awei, that disturblen you.
