Sotheli whanne he was comyn in to Rages, a citee of Medeis, and hadde ten talentis of siluer, of these thingis bi whiche he was onourid of the kyng;

Sotheli whanne the kyng Senacherib turnede ayen, fleynge fro Judee the veniaunce that God `hadde do aboute hym for his blasfemye, and he was wrooth, and killide many of the sones of Israel, Tobie biriede `the bodies of hem.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.22'>
And aftir that it was teld to the kyng, he comaundide Tobie to be slayn, and he took awei al his catel.
</verse>

Sotheli Tobie fledde with his sone and with his wijf, and was hid nakid, for many men loueden hym.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.24'>
Forsothe after fyue and fourti daies, the sones of the kyng kyilliden the kyng; and Tobie turnede ayen to his hows,

and al his catel was restorid to hym.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Tob.2'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.1'>
Forsothe aftir these thingis, whanne a feeste dai of the Lord was, and a good meete was maad in the hows of Tobie, he seide to his sone,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.2'>
Go thou, and brynge sum men of oure lynage, `that dreden God, that thei ete with vs.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.3'>
And whanne he was goon, he turnede ayen, and telde to hym, that oon of the sones of Israel lai stranglid in the street; and anoon `he skippide fro his sittyng place, and lefte the mete, and cam fastynge to the bodi; and he took it,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.4'>
and bar to his hows pryuely, for to birie hym warli, whanne the sunne was go doun.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.5'>
And whanne he hadde hid the bodi, he eet breed with morenyng and tremblyng,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.6'>
and remembride that word, which the Lord seide bi Amos, the prophete, Youre feeste daies schulen be turned in to morenyng and `lamentacioun, ether weilyng.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.7'>
Sotheli whanne the sunne was go doun, Tobie yede, and biriede hym.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.8'>
Forsothe alle hise neiyboris blameden hym, and seiden, Now for the cause of this thing thou were comaundid to be slayn, and vnnethis thou ascapidist the comaundement of deeth, and eft `biriest thou deed men?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.9'>
But Tobie dredde more God than the kyng, and took awei the bodies of slayn men, and hidde in his hows, and biriede tho in the myddil of nyytis.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.10'>
Sotheli it bifelde, that in sum day he was maad wery of biriyng; and he cam hoom, and leide hym silf bisidis a wal, and slepte;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.11'>
and while he slepte, hoote ordures `fellen doun fro the nest of swalewis on hise iyen; and he was maad blynd.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.12'>
Forsothe herfor the Lord suffride this temptacioun bifalle to hym, that the saumple of his pacience, `as also of seynt Job, schulde be youun to `after comeris.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.13'>
For whi whanne he dredde God euere fro his yong childhed, and kepte hise comaundementis, he was not sory ayens God, for the sikenesse of blyndnesse cam to hym;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.14'>
but he dwellide vnmouable in the drede of God, and dide thankyngis to God in alle the dais of his lijf.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.15'>
For whi as kyngis vpbreididen seynt Job, so it bifelde to this Tobie, hise eldris and kynesmen scorneden his lijf,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.16'>
and seiden, Where is thin hope, for which thou didist almes dedis and biriyngis?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.17'>
Sotheli Tobie blamyde hem, and seide,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.18'>
Nyle ye speke so, for we ben the sones of hooli men, and we abiden that lijf, which God schal yyue to hem that chaungen neuere her feith fro hym.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.19'>
Forsothe Anne, his wijf, yede ech dai to the `werk of weuyng, and brouyte lyuelode, which sche myyte gete of the trauel of hir hondis.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.20'>
Wherof it `was doon, that sche took a kide of geet, and brouyte hoom.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.21'>
And whanne hir hosebonde hadde herd the vois of this kide bletynge, he seide, Se ye, lest perauenture it be of thefte, but `yelde ye it to `hise lordis; for it is not leueful `to vs, ethir to ete ether to touche ony thing of thefte.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.22'>
At these thingis his wijf was wrooth, and answeride, Opynli thin hope is maad veyn, and thin almes dedis apperiden now.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.23'>
And bi these and `othere siche wordis sche seide schenschip to hym.

      <chapter osisID='Tob.3'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.1'>
Thanne Tobie inwardli sorewide, and bigan to preye with teeris, and seide, Lord,

thou art iust, and alle thi domes ben iust, and alle thi weies ben mercy, and treuthe, and doom.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.3'>
And now, Lord, haue thou mynde of me, and take thou not veniaunce of my synnes, nether haue thou mynde of my trespassis, ethir of my fadris.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.4'>
For we `obeieden not to `thi comaundementis, and we ben takun in to rifelyng, and in to caitifte, and in to deth, and in to `a fable, and in to schenschip to alle naciouns, among whiche thou hast scaterid vs.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.5'>
And now, Lord, thi domes ben grete; for we han not do aftir `thi comaundementis, and we han not go clenli bifor thee.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.6'>
And now, Lord, bi thi wille do thou merci with me, and comaunde thou my spirit to be resseyued in pees; for it spedith more to me to die than to lyue.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.7'>
And so it bifelde in the same dai, that Sare, the douyter of Raguel, was in Rages, a citee of Medeis, and sche herd schenschip of oon of the handmaidis of hir fadir;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.8'>
for sche was youun to seuene hosebondis, and a feend, Asmodeus bi name, killide hem, anoon as thei hadden entrid to hir.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.9'>
Therfor whanne sche blamyde `the damysele for her gilt, the damisele answeride to hir, and seide, Thou sleeresse of thin hosebondis, se we `no more a sone ether a douyter of thee `on erthe;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.10'>
whether also thou wolt sle me, as also thou hast slayn seuene men? At this vois sche yede in to the hiyere closet of hir hows, and thre daies and thre nyytis sche eet not, nether drank;

but sche contynuede in preier with teeris, and bisouyte God, that he schulde delyuere hir fro this schenschip.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.12'>
Forsothe it was doon in the thridde dai, while sche hadde fillid the preier,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.13'>
sche blesside the Lord, and seide, God of oure fadris, thi name is blessid, which whanne thou hast be wrooth, schalt do merci, and in tyme of tribulacioun foryyuest synnes to hem, that inwardli clepen thee.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.14'>
Lord, to thee Y turne togidere my face; to thee `Y reise `myn iyen.

But Y consentide to take an hosebonde with thi drede, not with my lust.

And ether Y was vnworthi to hem, ether thei perauenture weren not worthi to me; for in hap thou hast kept me to another hosebonde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.20'>
For thi councel is not in the power of man.

Forsothe ech that worschipith thee hath this for a certeyn, that if his lijf is in preuyng, he schal be corowned; sotheli if he is in tribulacioun, he schal be delyuerid; and if he is in chastisyng, it schal be leueful to come to thi merci.
