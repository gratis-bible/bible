      <chapter osisID='Neh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.1'>The words of Nehemiah, the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan, the palace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and [certain] men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province [are] in great affliction and reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem [is] broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept and mourned [certain] days and fasted and prayed before the God of the heavens</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'>and said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of the heavens, strong, great and terrible, who keeps covenant and mercy for those that love thee and observe thy commandments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'>let thine ear now be attentive and thine eyes open, that thou may hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the sons of Israel, thy servants, and I confess the sins of the sons of Israel, with which we have sinned against thee; both I and my father's house have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'>We have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments, which thou didst command thy servant Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'>Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou didst command thy servant Moses, saying, [If] ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'>but [if] ye turn unto me and keep my commandments and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heavens, [yet] will I gather them from there and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'>Now these [are] thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast ransomed with thy great power and with thy strong hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.11'>O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him grace before this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'>And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, the king, [that as] wine [was] before him, I took up the wine and gave [it] unto the king. And as I had not been sad before in his presence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'>the king said unto me, Why [is] thy countenance sad, seeing thou [art] not sick? This [is] nothing [else] but brokenness of heart. Then I was very sore afraid</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'>and said unto the king, Let the king live for ever; why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the house of my fathers' sepulchres, [lies] waste, and the its gates are consumed with fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.4'>Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.5'>And I said unto the king, If it pleases the king, and if thy servant has found favour in thy sight, that thou would send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may rebuild it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.6'>Then the king said unto me (the queen also sitting by him), For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? So the matter pleased the king, and he sent me; and I set him a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.7'>Moreover, I said unto the king, If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the captains on the other side of the river, that they may convey me over until I come into Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.8'>and a letter unto Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace of the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of the LORD upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.9'>Then I came to the captains of the other side of the river and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent princes of the army and horsemen with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.10'>When Sanballat, the Horonite, and Tobiah, the servant, the Ammonite, heard [of it], it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.11'>So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.12'>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither did I tell [any] man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem; neither [was there any] beast with me, except the beast that I rode upon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.13'>And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the fountain of the dragon and to the dung port and considered the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the its gates were consumed with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.14'>Then I went on to the gate of the fountain and to the king's pool, but [there was] no place for the beast [that was] under me to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.15'>Then went I up in the night by the brook and considered the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and [so] returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.16'>And the rulers did not know where I had gone or what I had done; neither had I as yet told [it] to the Jews nor to the priests nor to the nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.17'>Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we [are] in, how Jerusalem [lies] waste and its gates are burned with fire; come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no longer in reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.18'>Then I told them how the hand of my God was good upon me and likewise the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they comforted their hands for good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.19'>But when Sanballat, the Horonite, and Tobiah, the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem, the Arabian, heard [it], they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said, What is this thing that ye do? Will ye rebel against the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.20'>Then I gave them a reply and said unto them, The God of the heavens, he will prosper us; therefore, we, his servants, will arise and build; but ye have no portion nor righteousness, nor memorial in Jerusalem.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.1'>Then Eliashib, the high priest, rose up with his brethren, the priests, and they built the sheep gate; they sanctified it and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.2'>And next unto him the men of Jericho built. And next to them built Zaccur, the son of Imri.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.3'>And the sons of Hassenaah built the fish gate; they laid its beams and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.4'>And next to them Meremoth, the son of Urijah, the son of Koz restored. And next to them Meshullam, the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel restored. And next to them Zadok, the son of Baana, restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.5'>And next to them the Tekoites restored; but their nobles did not put their necks to the work of their Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.6'>Moreover, the old gate [was] restored [by] Jehoiada, the son of Paseah, and Meshullam, the son of Besodeiah; they laid its beams and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.7'>And next to them restored Melatiah, the Gibeonite, and Jadon, the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah, on behalf of the captain [of the king over the land] on this side the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.8'>Next to them Uzziel, the son of Harhaiah, of the refiners restored. Next unto him Hananiah, the son of [one of] the apothecaries, also restored, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.9'>And next unto them Rephaiah, the son of Hur, prince of the half part of Jerusalem, restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.10'>And next unto them, Jedaiah, the son of Harumaph restored, and over against his house. And next unto him Hattush, the son of Hashabniah, restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.11'>Malchijah, the son of Harim, and Hashub, the son of Pahathmoab, restored the other piece and the tower of the furnaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.12'>And next to them restored Shallum, the son of Halohesh, prince of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.13'>The valley gate [was] restored [by] Hanun with the inhabitants of Zanoah; they rebuilt it and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and a thousand cubits in the wall unto the dung gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.14'>And Malchiah, the son of Rechab, prince of the province of Bethhaccerem, restored the dung gate; he built it and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.15'>Shallun, the son of Colhozeh, the prince of the region of Mizpah, restored the gate of the fountain; he built it, covered it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and the wall of the pool of Siloah of the king's garden, unto the stairs that go down from the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.16'>After him restored Nehemiah, the son of Azbuk, the prince of half the region of Bethzur, unto [the place] over against the sepulchres of David and to the pool that was made and unto the house of the mighty.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'>But it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'>And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? Is this to be permitted them? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish on time? Will they resurrect the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which were burned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'>Now Tobiah, the Ammonite, [was] by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox [were to] go up [it], he would break down their stone wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'>Hear, O our God; for we are despised; and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of their captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'>And do not cover their iniquity, nor let their sin be blotted out from before thee, for they have become angry against the builders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'>But we built the wall, and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof, for the people were motivated to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'>And it came to pass when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were sound [and] that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.8'>and conspired all of them together to come [and] to fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.9'>Nevertheless, we made our prayer unto our God and set a watch over the [builders] day and night because of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.10'>And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and [there is] much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.11'>And our adversaries said, They shall not know or see until we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.12'>But it came to pass, that when the Jews who dwelt among them came, they advised us ten times of all the places from which they would come upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'>Therefore, I set in the lower places behind the wall, [and] on the higher places, I set the people by families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'>Then I looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, Do not be afraid of them: remember the Lord, [who is] great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'>And it came to pass when our enemies heard that we had understood it, God brought their counsel to nought, [and] we returned all of us to the wall, each one unto his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'>And it came to pass from that time forth [that] half of the young men wrought in the work, and the other half of them held spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail; and the princes [were] behind all the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'>Those that built on the wall and those that bore burdens and those that laded wrought with one hand in the work and with the other held a weapon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'>For the builders, each one had his sword girded by his side, and so they built. And he that sounded the shofar [was] by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'>And I said unto the principals and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work [is] great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'>In whatever place that you hear the voice of the shofar, join us there; our God shall fight for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'>So we laboured in the work, and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'>Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let each one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that by night they may be a guard to us, and labour by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'>So neither I nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, each one put them off [only] for washing.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>Then there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren, the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'>For there were [some] that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, [are] many; therefore we have bought grain that we may eat and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>There were also [some] that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy grain because of the famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'>And there were [some] that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, [and that] upon our lands and vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'>Yet now, [given] that the flesh of our brethren [is] as our flesh [and] their sons as our sons, behold, we subject our sons and our daughters to slavery, and there are [some] of our daughters in bondage [already]; neither [is it] in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'>And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'>Then I meditated unto myself, and I rebuked the principals and the rulers and said unto them, Does each one of you exact usury of his brother? And I set a great assembly against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'>And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren, the Jews who had been sold unto the Gentiles; and will ye even sell your brethren? And shall they be sold unto us? Then they remained silent, for they had nothing to answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'>Also I said, What you do is not good, do you not walk in the fear of our God, that ye not be the reproach of our enemies the Gentiles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'>I, likewise, [and] my brethren and my servants, have lent them money and grain; let us now release them from this burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'>Restore, I pray you, to them, today, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, and [even] the hundredth [part] of the money, and of the grain, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>Then they said, We will return [it] and will require nothing of them; so we will do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests and caused them to sware that they should do according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>Also I shook my lap and said, Thus will God shake out each man from his house and from his labour, that does not perform this promise, even thus shall he be shaken out and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'>Moreover, from the day that I was appointed [by the king] to be their captain in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, the king, [that is], twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the captain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'>But the former captains that [had been] before me had charged the people and had taken of them for bread and wine, upon forty shekels of silver; and in addition to this their servants bore rule over the people; but I did not do so because of the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'>In addition to this, I restored my part in the work of this wall, neither did we buy any inheritance; and all my servants [were] gathered together unto the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'>I also had at my table one hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, besides those that came unto us from among the Gentiles that [are] around us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.18'>Now [that] which was prepared for each day [was] one ox [and] six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and every ten days wine in all abundance; yet with all this I did not require the bread of the captain because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.1'>Now it came to pass when Sanballat and Tobiah and Geshem, the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall and [that] there was no breach left in it (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'>that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in [one of] the villages in the plain of Ono. But they had thought to do me evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I [am] doing a great work so that I cannot come down; why should the work cease, whilst I leave it and come down to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'>Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort, and I answered them after the same manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.5'>Then Sanballat sent his servant to say the same thing for the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.6'>in which [was] written, It is reported among the Gentiles, and Gashmu saith [it], [that] thou and the Jews think to rebel, for which cause thou dost build the wall, that thou may be their king, according to these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.7'>And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, [There is] a king in Judah! And now these words shall be heard by the king. Come now, therefore, and let us take counsel together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.8'>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou dost feign them out of thine own heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.9'>For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it not be done. Now, therefore, [O God], strengthen my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.10'>Afterward I came in secret unto the house of Shemaiah, the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabeel, who [was] shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they are coming to slay thee; yea, tonight they will come to slay thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.11'>Then I said, Should such a man as I flee? And who is there as I who could go into the temple and live? I will not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.12'>And I perceived that God had not sent him, but that he pronounced this prophecy against me, for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.13'>For he was bribed to make me be thus afraid and sin and [that] they might have [matter] for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.14'>My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works and on the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets, that [did things to] put me in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.15'>So the wall was finished the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.16'>And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard [of it], all the Gentiles that [were] about us feared, and they were much cast down in their own eyes, and they knew that this work was wrought of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.17'>Likewise, in those days the principals of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.18'>For [there were] many in Judah sworn unto him, because he [was] the son-in-law of Shechaniah, the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam, the son of Berechiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.19'>They also reported his good deeds before me and uttered my words to him. [And] Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.1'>Now it came to pass, when the wall was built and I had set up the doors and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.2'>that I commanded my brother Hanani, and Hananiah, the prince of the palace in Jerusalem (for he was as a man of truth and feared God above many);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.3'>and I said unto them, Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot and even [with] the [guards] present, let them shut the doors and bar [them]. And appoint guards of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each one in his watch and each one [to be] in front of his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.4'>Now the city [was] large and great, but there were few people in it, and the houses [were] not rebuilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.5'>And my God put [it] into my heart to gather together the principals and the rulers and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the register of the genealogy of those who had come up before and found written therein:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.8.5'>And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people (for he was above all the people), and when he opened it, all the people stood up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.6'>and Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, lifting up their hands; and they humbled themselves and worshipped the LORD with [their] faces to the ground.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.8.9'>And Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, and Ezra, the priest and scribe, and the Levites that caused the people to be attentive, said unto all the people, This day [is] holy unto the LORD your God; do not mourn nor weep.

        <verse osisID='Neh.8.10'>Then he said unto them, Go, eat the fat, and drink sweet wine, and send portions unto those who have nothing prepared; for [this] day [is] holy unto our Lord, and not sad; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.8.16'>So the people went forth and brought [them] and made themselves booths, each one upon the roof of his house and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God and in the plaza of the water gate and in the plaza of the gate of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.17'>And all the congregation of those that returned out of the captivity made booths and dwelt in the booths, for since the days of Jeshua, the son of Nun, unto that day, the sons of Israel had not done so. And there was very great joy.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.9.9'>And thou didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt and didst hear their cry by the Red sea</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.10'>and didst show signs and wonders upon Pharaoh and on all his servants and on all the people of his land; for thou didst know that they had dealt proudly against them. So didst thou make thee a name, as [it is] this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.11'>And thou didst divide the sea before them so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou didst throw into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.12'>Moreover, thou didst lead them by day with a pillar of cloud and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light in the way by which they should go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.13'>Thou didst come down upon Mount Sinai and didst speak with them from heaven and didst give them right judgments and true laws, good statutes and commandments,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.9.18'>Even when they had made themselves a molten calf and said, This [is] thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had committed great abominations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.19'>yet thou in thy manifold mercies didst not forsake them in the wilderness; the pillar of the cloud did not depart from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither did the pillar of fire by night, to illuminate the way in which they should go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.20'>Thou didst give thy good spirit to teach them and didst not withhold thy manna from their mouth and didst give them water for their thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.21'>[Yea], forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness [so that] they lacked nothing; their clothes did not wax old, and their feet did not swell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.22'>Thou didst give them kingdoms and peoples and didst divide them into corners; so they possessed the land of Sihon and the land of the king of Heshbon and the land of Og, king of Bashan.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.9.25'>And they took strong cities and fertile land and inherited houses full of all goods, hewn cisterns, vineyards and oliveyards and many trees of good fruit; so they ate and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.26'>Nevertheless, they were contentious and rebelled against thee and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets who testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great abominations.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.8'>And it grieved me sore; therefore, I cast forth all the household vessels of Tobiah out of the chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.9'>Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers; and I caused the vessels of the house of God to be brought there again, with the present and the frankincense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.10'>And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given [to them] and that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, had fled each one to his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.11'>Then I contended with the rulers and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together and set them in their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.12'>Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, of the new wine, and of the oil unto the store houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.13'>And I made treasurers over the store houses, Shelemiah, the priest, and Zadok, the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them [was] Hanan, the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their office [was] to distribute unto their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.14'>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my mercies that I have done for the house of my God and for its wards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.15'>In those days I saw in Judah [some] treading wine presses on the sabbath and bringing in sheaves and lading asses with wine, grapes, figs, and all [manner of] burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I protested [unto them] the day in which they sold the food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.16'>There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought fish and all manner of merchandise, and sold on the sabbath to the sons of Judah in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.17'>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah and said unto them, What evil thing [is] this that ye do and profane thus the sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.18'>Did not your fathers do this, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us and upon this city? Yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.19'>And it came to pass, that when shadow came to the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut and charged that they should not be opened until after the sabbath; and I set [some] of my servants at the gates, [that] no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.20'>So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of merchandise lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.21'>Then I testified and protested against them and said unto them, Why do ye lodge about the wall? If ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came no [more] on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.22'>And I told the Levites that they should cleanse themselves and [that] they should come [and] guard the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, [concerning] this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.23'>In those days I also saw Jews [that] had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.24'>and their sons spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and according to the language of each people; for they could not speak in the Jews' language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.25'>And I contended with them and cursed them and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair and made them swear by God, [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.26'>Did not Solomon, king of Israel, sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless, strange women caused even him to offend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.27'>Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange women?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.28'>And [one] of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib, the high priest, [was] son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore, I chased him from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.29'>Remember them, O my God because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.30'>Thus I cleansed them from all strangers and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, each one in his work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.31'>and for the wood offering, at the appointed times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.:</verse>
