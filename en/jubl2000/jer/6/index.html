Woe unto us! for the day goes away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus hath the LORD of the hosts said, Hew ye down trees and cast a mount against Jerusalem; this [is] the city that all of her is to be visited; [there is] violence in the midst of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As the waters never cease to flow from a fountain, so her wickedness never ceases to flow; injustice and robbery is heard in her; in my presence continually, sickness and wounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Chastise Jerusalem lest peradventure my soul be disjointed from thee, lest peradventure I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine; turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To whom shall I speak, and give warning that they may hear? behold, their ears [are] uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken, behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I have worked hard to hold myself in from pouring it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together; for the husband with the wife shall also be taken, the aged with [him that is] full of days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their houses shall be turned unto others, [with their] fields and wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them each one [is] given to greed; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one deals falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They treat also the destruction [of the daughter] of my people lightly, saying, Peace, peace; when [there is] no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? no, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush; therefore, they shall fall among those that shall fall: at the time [that] I visit them they shall fall, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus hath the LORD said, Stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths, where the good way [is] and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk [therein].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Also I set watchmen over you, [saying], Hearken to the sound of the shofar. But they said, We will not hearken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore hear, ye Gentiles, and know, O congregation of [Gentiles].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, [even] the fruit of their thoughts because they have not hearkened unto my words, and they hated my law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To what purpose does this incense come to me from Sheba and the sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt offerings [are] not according to my will, nor [are] your sacrifices sweet unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus hath the LORD said, Behold, a people come from the land of the north [wind], and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they [are] cruel, and they shall have no mercy; their voice shall roar like the sea; and they shall ride upon horses set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>We have heard the fame thereof; our hands wax feeble; anguish has taken hold of us, [and] pain as of a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Do not go forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy [and] fear [is] on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>O daughter of my people, gird [thee] with sackcloth and wallow thyself in ashes; make thee mourning, [as for] an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have set thee [for] a tower [and] a fortress among my people; thou shalt know and examine their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They [are] all rebellious princes; they walk with deception: [they are] brass and iron; they [are] all corrupters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The bellows are burned; the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melts in vain; for the wicked are not plucked away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Reprobate silver shall [men] call them because the LORD has rejected them.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
