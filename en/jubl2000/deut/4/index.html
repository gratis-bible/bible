for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God has destroyed them from among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God [are] alive, every one of you this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, I have taught you statutes and rights, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do thus in the midst of the land where ye are about to enter in to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Keep [them], therefore, and do [them], for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall hear all these statutes and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For what nation [is there] so great who [has] God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all [things that] we call upon him [for]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And what nation [is there] so great that has statutes and rights [so] just as all this law, which I set before you this day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore, take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life, but teach them to thy sons and thy sons' sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The day that thou didst stand before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather the people together unto me, and I will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth and [that] they may teach their sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And ye came near and stood under the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of the heavens, [with] darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD spoke unto you out of the midst of the fire; ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no likeness; only [ye heard] a voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, the ten words; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you the statutes and rights that ye might do them in the land which ye are about to enter to possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Diligently guard, therefore, your souls, for ye saw no manner of likeness on the day [that] the LORD spoke unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>lest ye corrupt [yourselves] and make yourselves a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the likeness of any beast that [is] on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flies in the air,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>the likeness of any animal that moves on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, [even] all the host of heaven, [and] should be driven to worship them and serve them because the LORD thy God has conceded them unto all the peoples under all the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the LORD has taken you and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, [even] out of Egypt, to be unto him the people of [his] inheritance, as [ye are] this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Furthermore, the LORD was angry with me for your sakes and swore that I should not go over Jordan and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God gives thee [for] an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, I must die in this land and will not pass the Jordan, but ye shall pass and inherit that good land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Keep yourselves, do not forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he established with you, and make yourselves a graven image [or] the likeness of any [thing], which the LORD thy God has forbidden thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, [even] a jealous God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When thou shalt beget children and grandchildren and ye shall have remained long in the land and shall corrupt [yourselves] and make a graven image or the likeness of any [thing] and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I put heaven and earth as witnesses today that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land unto which ye pass the Jordan to inherit it;

[there is] no one else other than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Out of the heavens he made thee to hear his voice that he might instruct thee, and upon earth he showed thee his great fire, and thou hast heard his words out of the midst of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And because he loved thy fathers, therefore, he chose their seed after them and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>to drive out Gentiles from before thee greater and mightier than thou [art], to bring thee in, to give thee their land [for] an inheritance, as [it is] this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Know therefore this day and consider it in thine heart that the LORD is the only God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; [there is] no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thou shalt keep, therefore, his statutes and his commandments which I command thee this day that it may go well with thee and with thy sons after thee and that thou may prolong [thy] days upon the land which the LORD thy God gives thee, for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Moses separated three cities on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrising</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>that the murderer might flee there, who should kill his neighbour unawares and hated him not in times past and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>[Namely], Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And this [is] the law which Moses set before the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>These [are] the testimonies and the statutes and the rights, which Moses spoke unto the sons of Israel after they came forth out of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>on this side of the Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel smote after they were come forth out of Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and they possessed his land and the land of Og, king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, who [were] on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>From Aroer, which [is] by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto Mount Sion, which [is] Hermon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and all the plain on this side of the Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
