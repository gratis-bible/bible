but Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them; and afterward I brought you out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I brought your fathers out of Egypt; and [when] ye came to the sea, the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt; and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of the Jordan, and they fought with you, but I delivered them into your hands that ye might possess their land, and I destroyed them from before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Balak, the son of Zippor, king of the Moabites, arose and warred against Israel and sent and called Balaam, the son of Beor, to curse you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I would not hearken unto Balaam; to the contrary, he blessed you repeatedly, and I delivered you out of his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And ye passed the Jordan and came to Jericho; and the lords of Jericho fought against you: the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I sent hornets before you, which drove them out from before you, [even] the two kings of the Amorites, [but] not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour and cities which ye did not build, and ye dwell in them and eat of vineyards and oliveyards which ye did not plant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now therefore fear the LORD and serve him in perfection and in truth and put away [from among you] the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the river and in Egypt, and serve ye the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if it seems evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that [were] on the other side of the river or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the people answered and said, May it never happen that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the LORD our God, he [it is] that brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage and who did those great signs in our sight and has kept us in all the way in which we went and among all the peoples through whom we passed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the LORD drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land; [therefore,]will we also serve the LORD, for he [is] our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD, for he [is] a holy God; he [is] a jealous God; he will not allow your rebellions nor your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If ye forsake the LORD and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you, after he has done you good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people said unto Joshua, No, but we will serve the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joshua said unto the people, Ye [shall be] witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We [shall be] witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, therefore, take away, the strange gods which [are] among you and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the people replied unto Joshua, We will serve the LORD our God and hear his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them statutes and laws in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and taking a great stone, he set it up there under an oak that [was] in the sanctuary of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us, for it has heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke unto us: it shall be, therefore, a witness unto you lest ye deny your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Joshua sent the people, each one unto his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And after these things, Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, [being] one hundred and ten years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they buried him within the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which [is] in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the Mountain of Gaash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua and who had known all the works of the LORD that he had done with Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem in the part of the field which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for one hundred ewes, and it became the inheritance of the sons of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Eleazar, the son of Aaron, died, and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas, his son, which was given to him in the mountain of Ephraim.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
