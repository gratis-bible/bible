      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show unto his servants things which are convenient to do quickly, and he sent and signified [it] by his angel unto his servant John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>who bore witness of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed is he that reads and those that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein, for the time [is] at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John, to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace [be] unto you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jesus, the Christ, [who is] the faithful witness [and] the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins with his own blood</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and has made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold, he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him and those [also] who pierced him; and all kindreds of the earth shall wail over him. Even so, Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>I AM the Alpha and the Omega, beginning and end, saith the Lord, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I John, your brother and participant in the tribulation and in the kingdom and in the patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in the Spirit in the day of the Lord and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>that said, I AM the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, and What thou seest, write in a book and send [it] unto the seven churches which are in Asia: unto Ephesus and unto Smyrna and unto Pergamos and unto Thyatira and unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>and in the midst of the seven candlesticks [one] like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the feet and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>His head and [his] hairs [were] white like white wool, as the snow, and his eyes [were] as a flame of fire</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>and his feet like unto brilliant metal as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>And he had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword, and his countenance [was] as the sun when [it] shines in its strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I AM the first and the last,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>and he that lives and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen, and have the keys of Hades and of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write the things which thou hast seen and the things which are and the things which must be after these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things, saith he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear those who are evil; and thou hast tried those who say they are apostles and are not and hast found them liars,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>and hast suffered, and doth suffer and for my name's sake hast laboured and hast not fainted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>Nevertheless I have against thee that thou hast left thy first [love], charity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Remember, therefore, from where thou art fallen and repent and do the first works, or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>And unto the angel of the church of Smyrna write: These things, saith the first and the last, who was dead, and is alive:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I know thy works and tribulation and poverty, (but thou art rich), and [I know] the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not, but [are] the synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer; behold, the devil shall cast [some] of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days; be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things, saith he, who has the sharp sword with two edges:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I know thy works and where thou dwellest, [even] where Satan's throne [is], and thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith, even in those days in which Antipas [was] my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where Satan dwellest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things against thee because thou hast there those that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>So hast thou also those that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Repent, or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcomes I will give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a small white stone and in the stone a new name written, which no one knows except the one that receives [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things, saith the Son of God, who has his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet like unto brilliant metal:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I have known thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last [to be] more than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel (who calls herself a prophetess) to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I have given her time to repent of her fornication, and she repented not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Behold, I will cast her into a bed and those that commit adultery with her into great tribulation unless they repent of their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>And I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I AM he that searches the kidneys and hearts, and I will give unto each one of you according to your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But unto you I say and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine and who have not known the depths of Satan (as they say); I will put upon you no other burden</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>But that which ye have [already] hold fast until I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>And he that overcomes and keeps my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the Gentiles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter they shall be broken to shivers, even as I received of my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>And I will give him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things, saith he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die; for I have not found thy works perfect before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Remember, therefore, of that which thou hast received and heard and hold to it and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come to thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>Thou hast a few persons also in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He that overcomes shall likewise be clothed in white raiment, and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things, saith he that is Holy and True, he who has the key of David, who opens and no one shuts and shuts, and no one opens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>I know thy works; behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no one can shut it, for thou hast a little strength and hast kept my word and hast not denied my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but do lie; behold, I will constrain them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the entre world, to try those that dwell upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>Behold, I come quickly; hold fast that which thou hast, that no one take thy crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>He that overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more, and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God [which is] the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from [and] with my God, and [I will write upon him] my new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; Behold, he who saith, Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; I would thou wert cold or hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>So then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I counsel thee to buy of me gold refined in the fire, that thou may be made rich; and clothed in white raiment, so that the shame of thy nakedness not be uncovered; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore, and repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Behold, I stand at the door and call; if anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into him and will sup with him, and he with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame and have sat down with my Father in his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After these things I looked, and, behold, an open door in heaven, and the first voice which I heard, was like a trumpet that spoke with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show thee the things that need to be done after these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>And immediately I was in the spirit, and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and there was one seated upon the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>And he that was seated was like a jasper and a sardine stone to look upon; and [there was] a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>And round about the throne [were] twenty-four thrones, and upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices; and [there were] seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>And before the throne [there was] a sea of glass like unto crystal, and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne [were] four animals full of eyes in front and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>And the first animal [was] like a lion and the second animal like a calf, and the third animal had a face as a man, and the fourth animal [was] like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And the four animals had each of them six wings about [him], and [they were] full of eyes within, and they did not cease day or night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And when those animals give glory and honour and praise to the one that is seated on the throne, who lives for ever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the twenty-four elders fall down before him that is seated on the throne and worship him that lives for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and virtue; for thou hast created all things, and by thy will they have their being and were created.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw in the right hand of him that was seated on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a strong angel preaching with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book and to loose its seals?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no one was able not in the heaven nor in the earth neither under the earth to open the book neither to look upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I wept much because no one was found worthy to open the book nor to read it neither to look upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>And one of the elders said unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, who has overcome to open the book and to loose its seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I saw, and, behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four animals and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that was seated upon the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when he had taken the book, the four animals and the twenty-four elders fell [on their faces] before the Lamb, each one of them having harps, and golden vials full of incense, which are the prayers of saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they sang a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book and to open its seals, for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us unto God by thy blood, out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>and hast made us unto our God kings and priests, and we shall reign on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>And I beheld, and I heard [the] voice of many angels round about the throne and of the animals and of the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to take power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And I heard every creature which is in heaven and upon the earth and under the earth and such as are upon the sea and all that are in it, saying, Blessing and honour and glory and power, [be] unto him that is seated upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four animals said, Amen. And the twenty-four elders fell [on their faces] and worshipped him that lives for ever and ever.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw when the Lamb had opened the first seal, and I heard the first of the four animals, saying as with a voice of thunder, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I saw and, behold, a white horse; and he that was seated upon him had a bow, and a crown was given unto him, and he went forth victorious, that he might also overcome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second animal, which said, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And another horse went forth [that was] red, and unto him that was seated thereon was given power to take away the peace of the earth and that they should kill one another; and there was given unto him a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third animal, which said, Come and see. And I saw and, behold, a black horse, and he that was seated upon him had a yoke in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four animals, which said, A choenix of wheat for a denarius and three choenixes of barley for a denarius; and [see] thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth animal, which said, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And I looked and, behold, a green horse, and he that was seated upon him was named Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given unto him over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those that had been slain because [of] the word of God and for the testimony which they held:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on those that dwell in the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And white robes were given unto each one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little while until their fellow servants and their brethren, that should be killed as they [were], should be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I saw when he had opened the sixth seal, and, behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>and the stars of heaven fell upon the earth, even as a fig tree casts her figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>And the kings of the earth and the princes and the rich and the captains and the strong and every servant and every free [man] hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>and said to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of him that is seated upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>for the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand before him?:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
