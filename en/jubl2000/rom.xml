        <description>Translated from the Original Texts in Hebrew and Greek into Spanish by Casiodoro de Reina (1569) and compared with the revision of Cipriano de Valera (1602). Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah). It was also compared word for word with the Authorized Version (by King James) of 1611.

  <div type='book' osisID='Rom'>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, servant of Jesus, the Christ, called [to be] an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>(which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>of his Son (who was born unto him of the seed of David according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>who was declared [to be] the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection from the dead), of Jesus, the Christ, our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>By whom we have received the grace and the apostleship, to [cause] the faith to be obeyed among all the Gentiles in his name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>among whom ye are also the called of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called [to be] saints; ye have grace and peace of God our Father and of the Lord Jesus, the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First, I thank my God through Jesus, the Christ, regarding you all, that your faith is preached in all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I always remember you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I long to see you that I may impart with you some spiritual gift to confirm you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>that is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that many times I purposed to come unto you (but up until now I have been unable) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians; both to the wise and to the unwise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to announce the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of the Christ; for it is [the] power of God [to give] saving health to every one that believes: to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>For in him is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and injustice of men, who hold back the truth with injustice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>because that which is known of God is manifest to them; for God has showed [it] unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>For the invisible things of him, his eternal power and divinity, are clearly understood by the creation of the world and by the things that are made so that there is no excuse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>because having known God, they did not glorify [him] as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for [the] likeness of [an] image of corruptible man and of birds and of fourfooted beasts and of serpents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Therefore God also gave them over to the lusts of their own hearts for uncleanness, to contaminate their own bodies between [themselves],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for all ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>For this cause God gave them up unto shameful affections, for even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>and likewise also the males, leaving the natural use of the females, burned in their lust one toward another, males with males committing nefarious works and receiving in themselves the recompense that proceeded from their error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And even as they did not like to retain God in [their] knowledge, God gave them over to a perverse understanding, to do those things which are not convenient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, without mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>Who having understood the righteousness of God, they did not understand that those who do such things are worthy of death, not only those that do the same, but even those who encourage those that do them.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Therefore, thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest; for in that which thou dost judge another, thou dost condemn thyself; for thou that judgest [others] doest the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>For we are sure that the judgment of God is according to [the] truth against those who do such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>And dost thou think this, O man, that judgest those who do such things and [doest the same], that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or dost thou despise the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, ignoring that the goodness of God leads thee to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasures up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>who will render to everyone according to his deeds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>to those who persevered in well doing, glory and honour and incorruption, to those who seek eternal life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>but unto those that are contentious and do not obey the truth, but are persuaded by unrighteousness, indignation and wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>Tribulation and anguish [shall be] upon every human soul that does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>but glory, honour, and peace to everyone that works good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>For there is no respect of persons with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>(for not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>for when the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature that which is of the law, these, not having the law, are a law unto themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, accusing and also excusing their reasonings one with another)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>in the day when God shall judge that which men have covered up, according to my gospel by Jesus, the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>Behold, thou doth call thyself a Jew and art supported by the law and doth glory in God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>and dost know [his] will and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>and art confident that thou thyself art [a] guide of the blind, [a] light of those who [are] in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>an instructor of the ignorant, a teacher of children, who hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>Thou, therefore, who teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? Thou that dost abhorr idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, with rebellion to the law doth thou dishonour God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>For circumcision verily profits if thou keep the law, but if thou art a rebel to the law, thy circumcision is made [into] a foreskin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>Therefore if the uncircumcised keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his foreskin be counted for circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>And that which is by nature foreskin, but keeps the law perfectly, shall judge thee who with the letter and with the circumcision art rebellious to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is circumcision that which is done outwardly in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>but he [is] a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision [is that] of the heart, in the spirit [and] not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit [is there] of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much in every way: first, certainly, that the oracles of God have been entrusted unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For what if some of them did not believe? Shall their unbelief have made the truth of God without effect?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>No, in no wise: for God is true, and every man a liar; as it is written, That thou might be justified in thy words and might overcome when thou dost judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>And if our iniquity commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Shall [for this reason] God be unjust who sends punishment? (I speak as a man.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>No, in no wise: for then how shall God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie unto his glory, why even so am I also judged as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>And why not say (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? The condemnation of whom is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? Are we better [than they]? No, in no wise; for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles that they are all under sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>as it is written, There is no one righteous, no, not one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>there is no one that understands; there is no one that seeks after God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>They are all gone out of the way; they are together become unprofitable; there is no one that does good, no, not one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>Their throat [is] an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps [is] under their lips,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>their feet [are] swift to shed blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>destruction and misery [are] in their ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>and the way of peace they have not known;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>there is no fear of God before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know that all that the law says, it says to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may submit themselves unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>For by the deeds of the law, no flesh shall be justified in his sight; for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now, without the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>the righteousness, that is, of God by the faith of Jesus, the Christ, for all and upon all those that believe in him, for there is no difference;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>for all have sinned and are made destitute of the glory of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>[being] justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Jesus, the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>whom God purposed for reconciliation through faith in his blood for the manifestation of his righteousness, for the remission of sins that are past, by the patience of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>manifesting in this time his righteousness that he [only] be the just [one] and the justifier of him that is of the faith of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No, but by [the] law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>Therefore, we conclude that [a] man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>[Is he] the God of the Jews only? [Is he] not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>seeing [it is] one God who shall justify the circumcision by faith and [the] uncircumcision by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we then make void the law through faith? No, in no wise; to the contrary, we establish the law.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>For if Abraham were justified by works, he has [reason] to glory [in himself], but not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what does the scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>But unto him that works, the reward is not reckoned as grace, but as debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>But to him that does not work, but believes in him that justifies the ungodly, the faith is counted as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>Even as David also describes the blessedness of the man unto whom God doth attribute righteousness without works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>[saying], Blessed [are] those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>Blessed [is] the man to whom the Lord did not impute sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Is this blessedness, therefore, only upon the circumcision or also upon the uncircumcision? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And he received the circumcision as [a] sign, as [a] seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had, yet] being uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all the uncircumcised believers, that it might be counted unto them also as righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>that [he be] the father of the circumcision: not only to those who are of the circumcision, but also unto those who walk in the steps of the faith that was in our father Abraham before he was circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For the promise that he should be the heir of the world [was] not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if those who are of the law [are] the heirs, faith is [in] vain, and the promise annulled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>because the law works wrath; for where there is no law, [there is] no rebellion either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Therefore by faith, that [it might be] by grace, to the end the promise might be sure to all [the] seed, not only to that which is of the law, but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>as it is written, As a father of many Gentiles have I placed thee before God, whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which are not as those that are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>Who believed to wait against [all] hope, that he might become the father of many Gentiles, according to that which had been spoken [unto him], So shall thy seed be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>And he did not weaken in faith: he considered not his own body now dead when he was about one hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>he doubted not the promise of God, with unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>being fully persuaded that he was also powerful to do all that he had promised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>therefore, [his faith] was also attributed unto him as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now it is not written for his sake alone that it was [so] reckoned to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>but for us also to whom it shall be [so] reckoned, that is, to those that believe in him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Justified therefore by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus, the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>by whom we also have access by faith into this grace in which we stand and glory in hope of the glory [of the sons] of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only [this], but we even glory in the tribulations, knowing that the tribulation works patience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>and patience, experience; and experience, hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>and the hope shall not be ashamed, because the love of God is poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>For the Christ, when we were yet weak, in his time died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die, yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God increased the price of his charity toward us in that while we were yet sinners the Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Then much more now justified in his blood, we shall be saved from wrath by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled with God by the death of his Son, much more, [now] reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only this, but we even glory in God through our Lord Jesus, the Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Therefore, in the manner which sin entered into the world by one man, and because of sin, death; and so death passed upon all men in the one in whom all sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>For until the law, sin was in the world; but the sin was not imputed, [there] being no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even in those that did not sin after the manner of the rebellion of Adam, who is a figure of him that was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But not as the offense, so also [is] the gift. For if through the offense of [that] one many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of one man, Jesus the Christ, has abounded unto many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>Nor was it in the same manner as by one sin, likewise also the gift; for the judgment truly [came] of one [sin] unto condemnation, but grace [came] of many offenses unto justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if by one offense, death reigned [because] of one [man]; much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of gifts and of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>Therefore, in the same manner that by the iniquity of one [guilt came] upon all men unto condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one, [grace came] upon all men unto justification of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For as by one man's disobedience, many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>Moreover the law entered that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>so that in the same manner as sin has reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus, the Christ, our Lord.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>No, in no wise. How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Know ye not that all of us that are baptized into Jesus the Christ are baptized into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>For we are buried with him by baptism into death, that just as the Christ was raised up from the dead to the glory of the Father, likewise we also walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For if we have been planted together [in him] in the likeness of his death, we shall be also [in the likeness] of [his] resurrection,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>knowing this: that our old man is crucified with [him] that the body of sin might be destroyed that we should not serve sin any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For he that is dead is justified from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>Now if we die with the Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>knowing that the Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more; death has no more dominion over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>For [he] that is dead died unto sin once, and [he] that lives, lives unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>Likewise also reckon yourselves to be truly dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ, Jesus, our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>Neither present your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but present yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>So that sin shall have no dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace? No, in no wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Or know ye not that to whom ye present yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death or of the obedience unto righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>Thank God that, although ye were the servants of sin, ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine unto which ye are delivered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>and freed from sin, ye are become the servants of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>I speak a human thing because of the weakness of our flesh: that as ye presented your members to serve uncleanness and iniquity unto iniquity, likewise now present your members to serve righteousness unto holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>For being [previously] the servants of sin, [now] ye have been made the servants of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>What fruit had ye then in those things of which ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things [is] death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But now freed from sin and made servants to God, ye have as your fruit sanctification and as the end, everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.23'>For the wages of sin [is] death, but the grace of God [is] eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Know ye not, brethren (for I speak to those that know the law), that the law has dominion over a man [only] as long as he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For the woman who is subject to a husband is obligated to the law so long as the husband lives; but if the husband dies, she is free from the law of the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>So then if, while [her] husband lives, she belongs to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress if she belongs to another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>Likewise ye also, my brethren, are become dead to the law in the body of the Christ that ye should belong to another, [even] to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For while we were in the flesh, the affections of the sins which were by the law worked in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now we are free from the law of death in which we were held, that we might serve in newness of Spirit, and not [in] the oldness of the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? No, in no wise. But, I did not know sin except by the law; for [neither] would I have known lust if the law did not say, Thou shalt not covet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>Then sin, when there was occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of lust. For without the law sin was as if it were dormant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>So that without the law I lived for some time; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>And I found that the [same] commandment, which was unto life, was mortal [unto me].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin, having had occasion, deceived me by the commandment and by it killed [me].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>So the law is truly holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Was then that which is good made death unto me? No, in no wise. But sin, to show itself sin by that which is good, worked death in me, making sin exceedingly sinful by the commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>For we [now] know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold unto subjection by sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For that which I do, I do not understand, and not even the [good] that I desire [is what] I do; but what I hate, that [is what] I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>If then I do that which I do not desire, I approve that the law [is] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>So that it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>And I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwells no good thing; for I have the desire, but I am not able to perform that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For I do not do the good that I desire; but the evil which I do not desire, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>And if I do that which I do not desire, I am not working, but sin that dwells in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>So that, desiring to do good, I find [this] law: evil is natural unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I delight with the law of God with the inward man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>but I see another law in my members which rebels against the law of my mind, bringing captive unto the law of sin which is in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>The grace of God, by Jesus, the Christ, our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>So that now, [there is] no condemnation to those who are in Christ, Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ, Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For that which was impossible to the law, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>For those that are according to the flesh know the things that are of the flesh; but those that are according to the Spirit, the things that are of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>For the prudence of the flesh [is] death, but the prudence of the Spirit, life and peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>because the prudence of the flesh [is] enmity against God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, neither indeed can it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>So then, those that are carnal cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, because the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, that person is not of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>But if Christ is in you, the body is truly dead because of sin, but the Spirit [is] alive because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he that raised up the Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>For if ye live according to the flesh, ye shall die; but if through the Spirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>For all that are led by the Spirit of God, the same are sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For ye have not received the spirit of bondage to be in fear [again], but ye have received the Spirit of adoption [of sons], whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>For the same Spirit bears witness unto our spirit that we are sons of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>and if sons, also heirs certainly of God and joint-heirs with Christ, if so be that we suffer with [him] that we may be also glorified together [with him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>For I know with certainty that the sufferings of this present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory which shall be manifested in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the [earnest] hope of the creatures waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creatures were subjected to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>with the hope that the same creatures shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>For we [now] know that all the creatures groan [together] and travail in pain [together] until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not only they, but ourselves also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, [that is to say], the redemption of our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For in hope we are saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man sees, he does not wait for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we wait for that which we do not see, with patience we wait for [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>And likewise also the Spirit helps our weakness; for we know not how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit itself makes entreaty for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>But he that searches the hearts knows what is the desire of the Spirit, that according to [the will of] God, he makes entreaty for the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>And we [now] know that unto those who love God, all things help them unto good, to those who according to the purpose are called [to be saints].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.29'>For [unto] those whom he knew beforehand, he also marked out beforehand [the way] that they might be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.30'>And unto those whom he did mark out beforehand [the way], to these he also called; and to whom he called, these he also justified; and to whom he justified, these he also glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>What shall we then say to these things? If God [is] for us, who [shall be] against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>He that did not spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also give us all things with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who shall accuse the chosen of God's? God [is] he that justifies [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who [is] he that condemns [them]? Christ, Jesus, is he who died [and], even more, he that also rose again, who furthermore is at the right hand of God, who also makes entreaty for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who shall separate us from the charity of Christ? [shall] tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>(As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>Nevertheless, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>Therefore I am certain that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>nor height nor depth nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the charity of God, which is in Christ, Jesus our Lord.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For the magistrates are not a terror unto those who do good, but to the [doer of] evil. Is thy desire therefore to not fear the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>For for this cause ye also pay [them] tribute, for they are God's ministers, attending continually to this very thing.</verse>

He that eats, eats unto the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that does not eat, unto the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>For none of us live for ourselves, and no one dies for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>For if we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord; whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>Let us, therefore, not judge one another any more, but judge this rather: that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in [his] brother's way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>I know and trust in the Lord Jesus that for his sake there is nothing unclean, but to him that esteems any thing to be unclean, to him [it is] unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>But if thy brother is grieved because of [thy] food, now thou dost not walk in charity. Do not destroy him with thy food, for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>Let not then your good be evil spoken of;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>for the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.15.3'>For the Christ did not please himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of those that reproached thee fell on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.4'>For the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction that we, through patient [endurance] and through the comfort of the scriptures, might have hope.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.15.7'>Therefore bear one another, as the Christ also bore us, to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.8'>Now I say that Christ Jesus, was [a] minister of the circumcision, by the truth of God, to confirm the promises [made] unto the fathers;</verse>
