  <div type='book' osisID='Dan'>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.1'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.1'>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came unto Jerusalem and besieged it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.2'>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of God which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god, and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.3'>And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz the prince of his eunuchs, that he should bring [certain] of the sons of Israel of the royal lineage of the princes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.4'>young men in whom [there was] no blemish whatsoever but [who were] good looking and taught in all wisdom and wise in knowledge and of good understanding, and that [had] strength in them to stand in the king's palace, that they might be taught the letters and speech of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.5'>And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's food and of the wine which he drank, so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.6'>Now among these of the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.7'>unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel [the name] of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.8'>And Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's food, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.9'>(And God brought Daniel into grace and mercy with the prince of the eunuchs.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.10'>And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink; for when he shall see your faces more downcast than the [other] young men who [are] like unto you, then ye shall condemn my head before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.11'>Then Daniel said to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.12'>Prove, now, with thy servants ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.13'>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenances of the young men that eat of the portion of the king's food; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.14'>So he consented to them in this matter and proved them ten days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.15'>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than the young men who ate the portion of the king's food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.16'>Thus Melzar took the portion of their food and the wine that they should drink and gave them vegetables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.17'>And unto these four young men, God gave them knowledge and intelligence in all letters and science; furthermore Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.18'>Now at the end of the days after which the king had said he should bring them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.19'>And the king communed with them, and none among them all was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; and [therefore] they stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.20'>And in all matters of wisdom [and] intelligence, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians [and] astrologers that [were] in all his realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.21'>And Daniel continued [even] unto the first year of king Cyrus.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.2'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.1'>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, with which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep fled from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.2'>Then the king commanded to call magicians, astrologers, enchanters, and Chaldeans, that they might show the king his dreams. So they came and presented themselves before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.3'>And the king said unto them, I have dreamed [a] dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.4'>Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever; tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.5'>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from my [memory]; if ye will not make known unto me the dream with its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.6'>But if ye show the dream and its interpretation, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore show me the dream, and its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.7'>They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.8'>The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain time because ye see the thing is gone from my memory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.9'>But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, [there is but] one decree for you for ye certainly prepare lying and corrupt words to speak before me, until the time is changed; therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.10'>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king's matter; furthermore [there is] no king, prince, nor lord [that] asked such a thing of any magician or astrologer or Chaldean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.11'>Finally, the thing that the king requires is singular, and there is no one that can show it before the king except the angels [of God], whose dwelling is not with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.12'>For this cause the king was angry and very furious and commanded to destroy all the wise [men] of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.13'>And the decree went forth, and the wise [men] were taken to be slain, and they sought Daniel and his fellows to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.14'>Then Daniel spoke with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise [men] of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.15'>He spoke and said to Arioch the king's captain, What is the reason for which this decree has gone forth from the king with such haste? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.16'>And Daniel went in, and asked the king that he give him time and that he would show the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.17'>Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.18'>to petition mercies of the God of heaven concerning this mystery and that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise [men]of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.19'>Then the mystery was revealed unto Daniel in a night vision for which Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.20'>And Daniel spoke and said, Blessed be the name of God from age to age for wisdom and might are his;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.21'>and it is he that changes the times and the opportunities; he removes kings and sets up kings; he gives wisdom unto the wise and knowledge unto those that know understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.22'>He reveals that which is deep and hidden; he knows what [is] in darkness, and the light dwells with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.23'>Unto thee, O God of my fathers, do I confess and give thee praise that thou hast given me wisdom and might and now hast shown me what we asked of thee, for thou hast shown us the king's matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.24'>After this Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise [men] of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him, Do not destroy the wise [men] of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.25'>Then Arioch brought Daniel in before the king in haste and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.26'>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make me understand the dream which I have seen and its interpretation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.27'>Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said, The mystery which the king demands cannot be shown unto the king by wise [men], astrologers, magicians, nor fortune-tellers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.28'>But there is [a] God in the heavens who reveals the mysteries, and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall happen at the end of days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, is this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.29'>Thou, O king, in thy bed, thy thoughts rose up to know what should come to pass in the future; and he that reveals the mysteries showed thee what shall come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.30'>And unto me this mystery has been revealed, not for [any] wisdom that is in me more than in all those living but that I notify the interpretation to the king and that thou might understand the thoughts of thy heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.31'>Thou, O king, didst see and behold a great image. This image, which was very large and whose glory was very sublime, stood before thee, and its form [was] terrible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.32'>The head of this image [was] of fine gold, its breasts and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.33'>its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of baked clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.34'>Thou didst see until a stone was cut out, not with hands, which smote the image upon its feet [that were] of iron and baked clay and broke them to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.35'>Then was the iron, the baked clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them again; and the stone that smote the image was made into a great mountain that filled the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.36'>This [is] the dream, and we will tell its interpretation before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.37'>Thou, O king, [art] king of kings, for the God of heaven has given thee the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.38'>And everything that is inhabited by children of men, beasts of the field, and fowls of the heaven, [he] has given into thine hand, and has made thee ruler over them all. Thou [art] this head of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.39'>And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.40'>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron; and as iron breaks in pieces and subdues all [things], and as iron that breaks all these things, it shall break in pieces and bruise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.41'>And whereas thou didst see the feet and toes, part of baked potters' clay and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divisive; but there shall be in it [some] of the strength of the iron, such as thou didst see the iron mixed with baked clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.42'>And [as] the toes of the feet [were] part of iron and part of baked clay, [so] the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly fragile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.43'>Concerning that which thou didst see, the iron mixed with baked clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men, but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron does not mix with clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.44'>And in the days of those kings the God of heaven shall raise up a kingdom which eternally shall never become corrupted, and this kingdom shall not be left to another people, [but] it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.45'>In the manner which thou didst see that out of the mountain was cut one stone, not with hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has shown the king what shall come to pass hereafter; and the dream is true, and its interpretation sure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.46'>Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and humbled himself before Daniel and commanded that they should sacrifice presents and sweet odours unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.47'>The king answered unto Daniel and said, Certainly the God [that is] your God [is] God of gods and the Lord of the kings and the revealer of the mysteries, seeing thou could reveal this mystery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.48'>Then the king magnified Daniel and gave him many and great gifts and made him governor over the whole province of Babylon and prince of the governors over all the wise [men] of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.49'>And Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel [was] at the gate of the king.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.3'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king made a statue of gold, whose height [was] sixty cubits [and] its breadth six cubits; he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.2'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the great [ones], the assistants and captains, the judges, the treasurers, those of the council, presidents, and all the governors of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the statue which Nebuchadnezzar the king had raised up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.3'>Then the great [ones], the assistants and captains, the judges, the treasurers, those of the council, presidents, and all the governors of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king had raised up; and they stood before the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king had raised up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.4'>Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.5'>[that] when ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and of every musical instrument, ye [are to] fall down and worship the statue of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king has raised up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.6'>and whoever does not fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.7'>Therefore, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and every musical instrument, all the peoples, nations, and languages, fell down [and] worshipped the statue of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king had raised up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.8'>Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.9'>They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.10'>Thou, O king, hast made a law that every man upon hearing the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and every musical instrument, shall fall down and worship the statue of gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.11'>and whoever does not fall down and worship [that] he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.12'>There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee; they do not worship thy gods, nor [do they] worship the statue of gold which thou hast raised up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.13'>Then Nebuchadnezzar in [his] rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.14'>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them, [Is it] true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that ye do not honour my gods, nor worship the statue of gold which I have set up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.15'>Now, are ye ready when ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and of every musical instrument to fall down and worship the statue which I made? For if ye do not worship, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who [is] that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.16'>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to king Nebuchadnezzar, We [are] not careful to answer thee in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.17'>Behold, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver [us] out of thine hand, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.18'>But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not worship thy god, nor honour the statue which thou hast raised up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.19'>Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; [therefore] he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was customary to be heated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.20'>And he commanded the most mighty men that [were] in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego [and] to cast [them] into the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.21'>Then these men were bound in their coats, their undergarments, and their hats, and their [other] garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.22'>Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.23'>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.24'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste [and] spoke and said unto his counsellors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.25'>He answered and said, Behold, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.26'>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace [and] spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth and come [here]. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.27'>And the great ones, the governors and the captains and the king's counsellors gathered together to see these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.28'>[Then] Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed [be] the God of these, of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.29'>Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, or language which speak blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.30'>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.4'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.1'>King Nebuchadnezzar, to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.2'>The signs and wonders that the high God has wrought with me are such that I must publish them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.3'>How great [are] his signs! and how mighty [are] his wonders! His kingdom [is] an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion [is] from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.4'>I Nebuchadnezzar was quiet in my house and flourishing in my palace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.5'>I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the imaginations and visions of my head troubled me in my bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.6'>Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise [men] of Babylon before me that they might show me the interpretation of the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.7'>Then the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the fortune-tellers came in and I told the dream before them; but they never showed me its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.8'>But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, who when I name him it seems to me that I name my god, and in whom [is] the spirit of the holy God; and before him I told the dream, [saying],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.9'>Belteshazzar, prince of the wise [men], [now that] I have understood that the spirit of the holy God is in thee, and that no mystery is hidden from thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen and its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.10'>Thus [were] the visions of my head in my bed: It seemed that I saw a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.11'>The tree grew and made itself strong, and its height reached unto heaven, and its sight to the end of all the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.12'>His leaves [were] fair, and his fruit abundant, and in him [was] food for all; underneath him the beasts of the field lay down in his shadow, and in his branches dwelt the fowls of the heaven, and all flesh was fed of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.13'>I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, one who was a watchman and holy descended from heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.14'>he cried aloud and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit; let the beasts get away from under him and the fowls from his branches:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.15'>nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and of brass shall he be bound in the green grass of the field; and let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and [let] his portion [be] with the beasts in the grass of the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.16'>let his heart be changed from a man's heart, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.17'>By sentence of the watchmen is the matter [resolved], and the case by the word of the holy ones to the intent that the living may know that the most High takes rule over the kingdom of men and gives it to whoever he will and sets up over it the man who is the lowest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.18'>I, king Nebuchadnezzar, saw this dream. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, shall declare its interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise [men] of my kingdom could never show me its interpretation; but thou [art] able, for the spirit of the holy God in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.19'>Then Daniel, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, was silent for almost one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. [Then] the king spoke and said, Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, [let] the dream [be] to thine enemies, and its interpretation to those that wish thee evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.20'>The tree that thou didst see, which grew and made himself strong, whose height reached unto the heaven and the sight thereof to all the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.21'>whose leaves [were] fair and his fruit abundant and in him [was] food for all, under whom the beasts of the field dwelt, and in whose branches the fowls of the heaven dwelt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.22'>it [is] thou, O king, that grew and made thyself strong; for thy greatness has grown and has reached unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.23'>And regarding that which the king saw, one who was a watchman and holy who came down from heaven and said, Hew the tree down and destroy it; yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and with a band of iron and of brass [let it remain bound] in the green grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and [let] his portion [be] with the beasts of the field until seven times pass over him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.24'>this [is] the interpretation, O king, and this [is] the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.25'>that they shall drive thee from among men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall feed thee with grass of the field as the oxen, and with the dew of heaven shalt thou be bathed, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou shalt understand that the most High takes rule over the kingdom of men and that he shall give it to whoever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.26'>And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots in the earth; thy kingdom shall remain sure unto thee, that thou shalt understand that the rule [is] in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.27'>Therefore, O king, approve my counsel and redeem thy sins with righteousness and thine iniquities with mercies unto the poor: behold the medicine for thy sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.28'>All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.29'>At the end of twelve months as he was walking upon the palace of the kingdom of Babylon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.30'>the king spoke and said, Is this not the great Babylon that I have built for [the] house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the glory of my greatness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.31'>The word was yet in the king's mouth when there fell a voice from heaven, [saying], O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.32'>and they drive thee from among men, and thy dwelling [shall be] with the beasts of the field; and they shall feed thee as the oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most High takes rule in the kingdom of men and gives it to whoever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.33'>The same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from among men and ate grass as the oxen, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like eagles' [feathers] and his nails like birds' [claws].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.34'>But at the end of the time I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes unto heaven, and my understanding was returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and glorified him that lives for ever, whose dominion [is] an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom [is] through all ages:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.35'>and all the inhabitants of the earth [are] counted as nothing; and in the army of heaven and in the inhabitants of the earth, he does according to his will; nor is there anyone who can interfere with his hand and say unto him, What doest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.36'>In the same time my reason was returned unto me, and I [turned] to the majesty of my kingdom; my dignity and greatness returned unto me; and my governors and my great [ones] sought me; and I was restored in my kingdom, and more [excellent] greatness was added unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.37'>Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and build up and glorify the King of heaven because all his works [are] truth, and his ways judgment: and he is able to humble those that walk with arrogance.:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.5'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.1'>Belshazzar the king made a great banquet to a thousand of his lords, and against the thousand he drank wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.2'>Belshazzar, under the influence of the wine, commanded that they bring the vessels of gold and of silver which Nebuchadnezzar his father had brought from the Temple of Jerusalem; that the king and his princes, his wives and his concubines, might drink with them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.5.6'>Then the king became pale, and his thoughts troubled him, and the girdings of his loins were unloosed, and his knees smote one against another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.7'>The king cried in [a] loud voice that they bring in the magicians, the Chaldeans, and the fortune-tellers.

        <verse osisID='Dan.5.11'>There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom [lives] the spirit of the holy God; and in the days of thy father light and intelligence and wisdom, like the knowledge of God, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar, thy father, made prince over all the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, [and] fortune-tellers; [thus did] thy father, the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.12'>because Daniel, whom the king named Beltechazzar, was found to have a more excellent spirit and greater knowledge and understanding interpreting dreams, unraveling questions, and dissolving doubts.

        <verse osisID='Dan.5.17'>Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be for thyself and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king and show him the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.18'>O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom and the greatness and the glory and the magnificence:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.19'>and by the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him; whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he humbled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.20'>But when his heart made itself arrogant, and his spirit hardened itself in pride, he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom, and they took his glory from him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.21'>and he was driven from among the sons of men; and his heart was put with the beasts, and his dwelling [was] with the wild asses: they made him eat grass like an ox, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven until he understood that the most high God takes rule of the kingdom of men and [that] he appoints over it whoever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.22'>And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.23'>but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy princes, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; furthermore, thou hast praised gods of silver and of gold, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone, which do not see, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand [is] thy soul and whose [are] all thy ways, thou hast never honoured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.24'>Then from his presence was sent the palm of the hand that sculpted this writing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.6.3'>Then this Daniel was preferred above these governors and presidents because an over abundance of [the] Spirit [was] in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.4'>Then the presidents and governors looked for occasions against Daniel on behalf of the kingdom, but they could find no occasion or fault because he was faithful, and no vice nor fault was found in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.5'>Then these men said, We shall never find any occasion against this Daniel except we find [it] against him in the law of his God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.6.8'>Now, O king, confirm the decree and sign the writing that it not be moved, according to the law of Media and of Persia, which does not change.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.9'>Therefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.10'>Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he entered into his house; and with the windows open toward Jerusalem in his dining chamber, he knelt three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he was used to doing before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.11'>Then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.12'>Then they went and spoke before the king concerning the royal decree; Hast thou not confirmed a decree that whoever shall ask [a petition] of any God or man within thirty days save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?

        <verse osisID='Dan.6.13'>Then they answered and said before the king, That Daniel, which [is] of the sons of the captivity of the Jews, has not regarded thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast confirmed, but makes his petition three times a day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.14'>When the king, heard the matter, it weighed very heavy upon him, and [he] set [his] heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured until the going down of the sun to deliver him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.15'>Then those men assembled near the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that this is the law of Media and of Persia: No decree nor statute which the king has confirmed may be moved.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.6.18'>Then the king went to his palace and lay down without eating; neither were instruments of music brought before him, and his sleep fled from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.19'>Therefore, the king arose very early in the morning at dawn and went in haste unto the den of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.20'>And when he came to the den, he cried loudly with a sad voice unto Daniel; [and] the king, in speaking to Daniel said, Daniel, servant of the living God, has thy God, whom thou servest continually, been able to deliver thee from the lions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.21'>Then Daniel said unto the king, O king, live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.22'>My God has sent his angel, who shut the lions' mouths, that they do me no evil because before him righteousness was found in me; and even before thee, O king, I have done no corruption.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.7.1'>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream [and] penned the sum of the matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.2'>Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven fought the great sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.3'>And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.4'>The first [was] like a lion, and had eagle's wings; I beheld until the its wings were plucked off, and it was removed from the earth, and it stood up on its feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.5'>And behold the second beast, like unto a bear, which went off to one side, and [it had] three ribs between its teeth; and thus was said unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.6'>After this I beheld, and behold another, like a tiger, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; this beast also had four heads; and power was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.7'>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold the fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and exceedingly strong; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and trod down that which was left with its feet; and it was very different from all the beasts that had been before her; and it had ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.8'>As I was considering the horns, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom three of the first horns were plucked up [by the roots]; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking grand things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.9'>I beheld until thrones were placed, and an Elder of great age did sit, whose garment [was] white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool: his throne [a] flame of fire, his wheels burning fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.10'>A river of fire issued and came forth from before him; thousands of thousands served him, and ten thousands of ten thousands stood before him; the Judge sat down, and the books were opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.11'>I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke; I beheld [even] until the beast was slain and its body was undone and given over to be burned in the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.12'>They had also taken from the other beasts their rule because their lives had been prolonged until a certain time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.13'>I saw in the vision of the night, and, behold, in the clouds of heaven like a Son of man that came and drew near unto the Elder of great age, and they brought him near before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.14'>And he gave him dominion and glory and kingdom; and all the peoples, nations, and tongues served him: his dominion [is] an eternal dominion, which shall not pass away, and his Kingdom such that it shall never be corrupted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.15'>My spirit was troubled, I Daniel, in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head astonished me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.16'>I came near unto one of those that stood by and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me and made me know the interpretation of the things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.17'>These great beasts, which are four, [are] four kings, [which] shall arise in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.18'>And they shall take the kingdom of the Holy [One who is] most High and possess the kingdom until the age and until the age of the ages.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.7.20'>also regarding the ten horns that [were] in its head, and [of] the other which came up, and before whom three fell; and that same horn had eyes and [a] mouth that spoke very grand things, whose appearance was greater than his fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.21'>I saw that this horn made war against the saints and overcame them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.22'>until such time as the Elder of great age came, and the judgment was given unto the saints of the most High; and the time came, and the saints possessed the Kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.23'>Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth king in earth, which shall be greater than all the other kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.24'>And the ten horns [signify] that of this kingdom ten kings shall arise; and another shall rise after them; and he shall be greater than the first [kings], and he shall bring down three kings.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.7.26'>And the Judge shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion to destroy and to cast out unto the end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.27'>and that the kingdom and the dominion, and the majesty of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, be given to the holy people of the most High, His Kingdom [shall be] an eternal Kingdom, and all the dominions shall serve him and hear [him].</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.8'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.1'>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, Daniel, after that [vision] which had appeared unto me before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.2'>And I saw in [the] vision; (and it came to pass, when I saw it, that I [was] at Shushan, which is [the] head of the kingdom in the province of Persia); so that I saw in that vision, being by the river of Ulai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.3'>and I lifted up my eyes and saw, and, behold, a ram was standing before the river, which had two horns; and even though they were high, the one [was] higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.4'>I saw that the ram smote with the horns to the west, to the north, and to the south and that no beast could stand before him, nor could anyone escape from his hand; but he did according to his will and made himself great.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.12.8'>And I heard, but I did not understand; then I said, O my Lord, what [is] the fulfillment of these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.9'>And he said, Go thy way, Daniel, for these words [are] closed up and sealed until the time of the fulfillment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.10'>Many shall be purified and made white and purged, but [the] wicked shall get worse; and none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.12.12'>Blessed [is] he that waits and comes unto one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.13'>And thou shall go to the end and shalt rest, and thou shalt raise up in thy lot at the end of the days.</verse>
