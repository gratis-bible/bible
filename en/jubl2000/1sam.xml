  <div type='book' osisID='1Sam'>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>Now there was a certain man of Ramath of Zophim, of Mount Ephraim, and his name [was] Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>And he had two wives; the name of the one [was] Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of the hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, [were] there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>And when the day would come, Elkanah would sacrifice, and he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>But unto Hannah he would give a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah, even though the LORD had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>And her rival provoked her to anger and sorrow because the LORD had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>And this would happen year by year when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she would provoke her; therefore, she would weep and not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>Then Elkanah, her husband, said to her, Hannah, why dost thou weep? And why dost thou not eat? And why is thy heart grieved? [Am] I not better to thee than ten sons?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>And she [was] in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the LORD and wept sore;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>and she vowed a vow and said, O LORD of the hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid and remember me and not forget thy handmaid but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>And it came to pass as she continued praying before the LORD that Eli was observing her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>Now Hannah spoke in her heart and only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore, Eli thought she was drunk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I [am] a woman of a sorrowful spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>Do not count thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial, for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief I have waited until now to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant [thee] thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and ate, and her countenance was no longer [sad].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>And they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the LORD and returned and came to their house to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>Therefore, it came to pass when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, she bore a son and called his name Samuel, [saying], Because I have asked him of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>And the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the LORD the accustomed sacrifice and his vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>But Hannah did not go up, for she said unto her husband, [I will not go up] until the child is weaned, and [then] I will bring him that he may be presented before the LORD and abide there for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>And Elkanah, her husband, said unto her, Do what seems good unto thee; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only [let] the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks and one ephah of flour and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh; and the child [was] young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>And they slew a bullock and brought the child to Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>And she said, Oh my lord, [as] thy soul lives, my lord, I [am] the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>For this child I prayed, and the LORD has given me my petition which I asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>Therefore, I also have given him back to the LORD; as long as he lives he shall belong to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>And Hannah prayed and said, My heart rejoices in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD; my mouth is enlarged over my enemies because I have rejoiced in thy saving health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>[There is] none holy as the LORD, for [there is] none beside thee; neither [is there] any strong One like our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>Do not multiply thyself speaking great and lofty things; let arrogant words cease from your mouth, for the LORD [is] the all-knowing God, and the [magnificent] works are his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>The bows of the mighty men [have been] broken, and the weak are girded with strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>[Those that were] full have hired themselves out for bread, and [those that were] hungry ceased so that the barren has given birth to seven, and she that has many children is waxed feeble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>The LORD kills, and he gives life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and lifts up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>He raises up the poor out of the dust [and] lifts up the beggar from the dunghill to set [them] among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth [are] the LORD'S, and he has set the world upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>He keeps the feet of his saints, and the wicked perish in darkness, for no man shall prevail by [their own] strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>LORD, thine adversaries shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven he shall thunder upon them. The LORD shall judge the ends of the earth, and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt the horn of his anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child ministered unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>But the sons of Eli [were] sons of Belial; they did not know the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>[It was] the priests' custom with the people [that] when anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come, while the flesh was being boiled, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>and he would strike [it] into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot, and all that the fleshhook brought up, the priest took for himself. Thus would they do in Shiloh to all the Israelites that went there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>Likewise, before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant would come and say to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, for he will not take cooked flesh of thee, but raw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>And [if] the man would say unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat today and [then] take [as much] as thy soul desires, then he would answer him, No, but thou shalt give [it to me] now, and if not, I will take [it] by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>Therefore, the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD, for men despised the present of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>But Samuel ministered before the LORD, [being] a child, girded with a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>Moreover his mother made him a little coat and brought [it] to him each year when she came up with her husband to offer the accustomed sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of the LORD. And they went unto their own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>And the LORD visited Hannah so that she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>Now Eli was very old and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel and how they lay with the women that served [at] the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>And he said unto them, Why do ye [do] such things? For I hear from all the people of your evil dealings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>No, my sons, for [it is] no good report that I hear that ye cause the people of the LORD to transgress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>If one man sins against another, the judges shall judge him, but if someone sins against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they did not hearken unto the voice of their father because the LORD had [already] decided to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>And the child Samuel kept on growing and was in favour both with the LORD and also with men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>And a man of God came unto Eli and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I not plainly appear unto the house of thy father when they were in Egypt in the house of Pharaoh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel [to be] my priest, to offer upon my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me, and I gave unto the house of thy father all the offerings on fire of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>Why do ye trample my sacrifices and my offerings which I have commanded [to be offered] in my tabernacle and honor thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>Therefore, the LORD God of Israel said, I had said indeed [that] thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever, but now the LORD said, It shall never be; for those that honor me I will honor, and those that lightly esteem me shall be vile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Behold, the days come that I will cut off thine arm and the arm of thy father's house that there shall not be an old man in thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>And thou shalt see a competitor [in my] tabernacle in all the things in which I shall do good unto Israel, and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>I shall not [totally] cut off [all] thy men from my altar to consume thine eyes and to grieve thy soul, and all the increase of thy house shall die as [young] men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>And this [shall be] a sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall both die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>And I will raise me up a faithful priest [that] shall do according to [that] which [is] in my heart and in my mind, and I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before my anointed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>And it shall come to pass [that] every one that is left in thy house shall come [and] crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into some aspect of the priesthood that I may eat a piece of bread.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; [there was] no open vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.2'>And it came to pass one day when Eli [was] lain down in his place, his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.3'>and before the lamp of God was put out, Samuel was sleeping in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God [was];</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.4'>and the LORD called Samuel, and he answered, Here [am] I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.5'>And he ran unto Eli and said, Here [am] I, for thou didst call me. And he said, I did not call; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.6'>And the LORD called Samuel yet again. And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, Here [am] I, for thou didst call me. And he answered, I did not call, my son; lie down again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.7'>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither had the word of the LORD yet been revealed unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.8'>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, Here [am] I, for thou didst call me. Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.9'>Therefore, Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down, and it shall be if he calls thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD, for thy servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.10'>And the LORD came and stood and called as at the other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant hears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.11'>And the LORD said unto Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of each one that hears it shall tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.12'>In that day I will perform against Eli all the things which I have spoken concerning his house; when I begin, I will also make an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.13'>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knows of (because his sons made themselves vile, and he did not restrain them).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.14'>And therefore, I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be reconciled, [not] with sacrifices nor with presents for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.15'>And Samuel lay until the morning and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.16'>Then Eli called Samuel and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here [am] I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.17'>And he said, What [is] the word that [the LORD] has spoken unto thee? I pray thee do not hide [it] from me. God do so to thee and more also, if thou hide [any] thing from me of all the word that he spoke unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.18'>And Samuel declared all of it to him without hiding any thing. Then he said, It [is] the LORD; let him do what seems good unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.19'>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and did not let any of his words fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.20'>And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel [was] a faithful prophet of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.21'>Thus the LORD appeared again in Shiloh, for the LORD manifested himself to Samuel in Shiloh with [the] word of the LORD.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.1'>And Samuel spoke unto all Israel. Now [at that time] Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle and pitched [their] camp beside Ebenezer; and the Philistines pitched theirs in Aphek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.2'>And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel; and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines, who slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.3'>And when the people returned into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has the LORD smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us that when it comes among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.4'>So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of the hosts, who dwells [between] the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, [were] there with the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.5'>And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with [such] a great shout that the earth trembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.6'>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What great shout [of joy is] this in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.7'>And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God has come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! For yesterday and day before yesterday it was not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.8'>Woe unto us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These [are] the gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.9'>Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye not serve the Hebrews as they have served you; quit yourselves like men and fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.10'>And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled each one into his tent, and there was a very great slaughter, for thirty thousand footmen of Israel fell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.11'>And the ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.12'>And running out of the battle, [a] man of Benjamin came to Shiloh that same day with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.13'>And when he came, behold Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and gave the news, all the city cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.14'>And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What [is] the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily and told Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.15'>Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes had become dim so that he could not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.16'>And the man said unto Eli, I come from the battle; I fled today out of the army. And he said [unto him], What has happened, my son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.17'>And the messenger answered and said, Israel fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.18'>And it came to pass when he made mention of the ark of God, [Eli] fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died; for he was an old man and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.19'>And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, [near] to be delivered, and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed, for her pains had come upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.20'>And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not, for thou hast given birth to a son. But she did not answer, neither did she regard [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.21'>And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel! (Because the ark of God was taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.22'>Therefore, she said, The glory is departed from Israel, for the ark of God is taken.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.1'>And the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.2'>When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon and set it by Dagon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.3'>And when those of Ashdod arose early in the morning, behold, Dagon [had] fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon and set him in his place again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.4'>And when they arose early on the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD, and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands [were] cut off upon the threshold; only [the stump of] Dagon was left to him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.13'>And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and his armourbearer after him; and they fell before Jonathan, and his armourbearer slew after him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.11'>It grieves me that I have set up Saul [to be] king, for he has turned back from following me and has not performed my commandments. And it incensed Samuel, and he cried unto the LORD all night.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.21'>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the firstfruits of the anathema, to sacrifice them unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.22'>And Samuel said, Does the LORD have [as great] delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in hearing the voice of the LORD? Behold, to hear [is] better than sacrifice [and] to hearken than the fat of rams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.23'>For rebellion [is] the sin of witchcraft, and to break [the word of the Lord is] iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected thee from [being] king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.24'>Then Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and thy words because I feared the people and consented unto their voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.25'>Now, therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin and turn again with me that I may worship the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.26'>And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee, for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected thee from being king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.27'>And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.28'>And Samuel said unto him, The LORD has rent the kingdom of Israel from thee today and has given it to a neighbour of thine [that is] better than thou.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.29'>And also the Overcomer of Israel will not lie nor repent concerning this, for he [is] not a man, that he should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.30'>Then he said, I have sinned; [yet] honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people and before Israel and turn again with me that I may worship the LORD thy God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.32'>Then Samuel said, Bring me Agag, the king of Amalek. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is near.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.2'>And he said unto him, No, in no wise; thou shalt not die. Behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show it me, and why should my father hide this thing from me? It [shall] not [be] so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.3'>And David swore moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knows that I have found grace in thine eyes, and he [saith in himself], Let Jonathan not know this lest he be grieved; but truly [as] the LORD lives and [as] thy soul lives, [there is] but a step between me and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.4'>Then Jonathan said unto David, Whatever thy soul saith, I will do [it] for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.5'>And David replied unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow [is] the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at food, but thou shalt let me go and hide myself in the field until the evening of the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.6'>If thy father at all misses me, then say, David earnestly asked [leave] of me that he might run to Bethlehem, his city, for all those of his lineage have an anniversary sacrifice.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.8'>Therefore, thou shalt deal in mercy with thy servant, for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee; notwithstanding, if there is iniquity in me, slay me thyself, for why should thou bring me to thy father?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.11'>And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And both of them went out into the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.12'>Then Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I shall have asked my father tomorrow at this time or after tomorrow and, behold, [if there is] good toward David and I then do not send unto thee and show it to thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.13'>the LORD do so and much more to Jonathan. But if it pleases my father [to do] thee evil, then I will show it to thee and send thee away that thou may go in peace; and the LORD be with thee as he has been with my father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.15'>thou shalt not cut off thy mercy from my house for ever. When the LORD has cut off one by one the enemies of David from the face of the earth, remove [even] Jonathan from thy house [if I fail thee] and require it at the hand of David's enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.16'>So Jonathan made [a covenant] with the house of David.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.18'>Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow [is] the new moon, and thou shalt be missed because thy seat will be empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.19'>And [when] thou hast stayed three days, [then] thou shalt go down quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself on the day of the work and shalt remain by the stone Ezel;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.21'>And, behold, I will send a lad, [saying], Go, find the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows [are] on this side of thee; take them, then come thou, for [there is] peace unto thee and no hurt, [as] the LORD lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.22'>But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows [are] beyond thee, then go away, for the LORD has sent thee away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.24'>So David hid himself in the field, and when the new moon was come, the king sat down to eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.25'>And the king sat upon his seat as at other times, [even] upon a seat by the wall; and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.26'>Nevertheless, Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he [is] not clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.27'>And it came to pass on the next day, [which was] the second [day] of the new moon, that David's place was empty, and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Why did not the son of Jesse come to food, neither yesterday nor today?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.28'>And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked [leave] of me [to go] to Bethlehem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.29'>And he said, Let me go, I pray thee, for those of our lineage have a sacrifice in the city, and my brother, he has commanded me [to be there], and now, if I have found grace in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he has not come unto the king's table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.30'>Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious [woman], do I not know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mother's shame?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.31'>For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the land, thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom. Therefore, now send and bring him unto me, for he shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.32'>And Jonathan answered Saul his father and said unto him, Why shall he be slain? What has he done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.33'>And Saul cast a spear at him to smite him whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.34'>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food the second day of the new moon, for he was grieved for David [and] because his father had done him shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.35'>And it came to pass in the morning that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.36'>And he said unto his lad, Run and find the arrows which I shoot. [And] as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.37'>And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, [Is] not the arrow beyond thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.38'>And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows and came to his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.39'>But the lad did not understand anything; only Jonathan and David understood the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.40'>And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad and said unto him, Go, carry [them] to the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.41'>[And] as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of [a place] toward the Negev and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times, and they kissed one another and wept one with another, although David exceeded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.42'>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed, and Jonathan entered into the city.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.3'>Now, therefore, what is under thy hand? Give [me] five [loaves of] bread in my hand or what there is present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.4'>And the priest answered David and said, [There is] no common bread under my hand; there is only sacred bread, which I will give thee if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.5'>And David answered the priest and said unto him, Of a truth women [have been] kept from us since yesterday and the day before yesterday since I came out, and the vessels of the young men were holy although the way is profane; how much more that today it shall be sanctified with the vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.6'>So the priest gave him the sacred bread, for there was no bread there but the showbread that had been taken from before the LORD to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.7'>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul [was] there that day, fulfilling [a vow] before the LORD, and his name [was] Doeg, an Edomite, the principal of the pastors of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.8'>And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand a spear or a sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the king's business required haste.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.1'>And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight against Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know for certain, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.2'>And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore, I will make thee keeper of my head all the days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.3'>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah in his own city. And Saul had removed the spiritists and the diviners out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.4'>And the Philistines gathered themselves together and came and pitched camp in Shunem, and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched camp in Gilboa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.5'>And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.6'>And Saul enquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams nor by Urim nor by prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.7'>Then Saul said unto his servants, Seek me a woman that is a spiritist that I may go to her and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, [there is] a woman that is a spiritist at Endor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.8'>And Saul disguised himself and put on other clothing, and he went with two men, and they came to the woman by night; and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by spiritism and bring me [him] up whom I shall name unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.9'>And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul has done, how he has cut off the spiritists and the diviners out of the land; why then dost thou lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.10'>And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, [As] the LORD lives, no iniquity shall come upon thee for this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.11'>Then the woman said, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.12'>And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? For thou [art] Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.13'>And the king said unto her, Do not be afraid. What didst thou see? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods rising out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.14'>And he said unto her, What form [is] he of? And she said, An old man comes, and he [is] covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it [was] Samuel, and he stooped with [his] face to the ground and worshipped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.15'>And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed, for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me and no longer answers me neither by prophets nor by dreams; therefore, I have called thee that thou may make known unto me what I shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.16'>Then Samuel said, Why then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thy enemy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.17'>The LORD, therefore, has done as he spoke by me! For the LORD has rent the kingdom out of thy hand and given it to thy neighbour, [even] to David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.18'>Because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of the LORD nor execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek; therefore, the LORD has done this thing unto thee today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.19'>And the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow [shalt] thou and thy sons [be] with me; the LORD shall also deliver the camp of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.20'>Then Saul, as great as he was, fell suddenly to the earth and was sore afraid because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all that day nor all that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.21'>And the woman came unto Saul and saw that he was sore troubled and said unto him, Behold, thy handmaid has heard thy voice, and I have put my soul in my hand and have hearkened unto thy words which thou didst speak unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.22'>Now, therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou may have strength, and go on thy way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.23'>But he refused and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him, and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the ground and sat upon a bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.24'>And the woman had a fat calf in the house, and she hastened and killed it and took flour and kneaded [it] and baked unleavened bread with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.25'>And she brought [it] before Saul and before his servants, and after they ate, they rose up and went away that night.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.29'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.1'>Now the Philistines gathered together all their camps to Aphek, and the Israelites pitched camp by a fountain which [is] in Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.2'>And as the cardinals of the Philistines reviewed their companies of hundreds and of thousands, David and his men were in the rear with Achish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.3'>Then the princes of the Philistines said, What are these Hebrews doing here? And Achish replied unto the princes of the Philistines, [Is] not this David, the servant of Saul, the king of Israel, who has been with me these days or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell [unto me] unto this day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.4'>Then the princes of the Philistines were angry with him, and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him and not come with us to the battle lest in the battle he be an adversary to us, for with what should he return to the good graces of his master than with the heads of these men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.5'>[Is] not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands and David his ten thousands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.6'>Then Achish called David and said unto him, Surely, [as] the LORD lives, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the camp [is] good in my sight; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day; nevertheless, thou art not good in the eyes of the cardinals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.7'>Therefore, now return and go in peace that thou not do evil in the eyes of the cardinals of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.8'>And David replied unto Achish, But what have I done? And what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.9'>And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou [art] good in my sight as an angel of God; notwithstanding, the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.10'>Therefore, now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee, and as soon as ye are up early in the morning and it is light, depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.11'>So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.30'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.1'>And it came to pass when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day that the Amalekites had invaded the Negev and Ziklag and had smitten Ziklag and burned it with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.2'>And [they] had taken the women captives that [were] therein, from the youngest to the oldest; they did not kill any but carried [them] away and went on their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.3'>So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, [it was] burned with fire, and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.4'>Then David and the people that [were] with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.5'>And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail, who [had been] the wife of Nabal of Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.6'>And David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him because the soul of all the people was bitter, each one for his sons and for his daughters; but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.7'>And David said to Abiathar, the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring the ephod here to me. And Abiathar brought the ephod to David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.8'>And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? Shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake [them] and without fail recover [all].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.9'>So David went, he and the six hundred men that [were] with him, and they came to the brook Besor, where some stayed behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.10'>But David pursued, he and four hundred men, for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.11'>And they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David and gave him bread to eat and water to drink,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.12'>and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two bunches of raisins. And when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him, for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk [any] water, three days and three nights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.13'>And David said unto him, To whom [dost] thou [belong] and where [art] thou from? And the young Egyptian said, I am the servant to an Amalekite, and my master left me three days ago because I was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.14'>We made an invasion [upon] towards the Negev from the Chereth and upon Judah and towards the Negev from Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.15'>And David said to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.16'>And so he brought him down, and behold, [they were] spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and holding a feast because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines and out of the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.17'>And David smote them from the [morning] twilight even unto the evening of the next day, and none of them escaped except four hundred young men who rode upon camels and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.18'>And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away, and David delivered his two wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.19'>And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great neither sons nor daughters, of the robbery and of all the things that had been taken from them; David recovered it all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.20'>And David took all the sheep and the cows, and bringing them with all the [other] livestock, they said, This [is] David's spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.21'>And David came to the two hundred men who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to remain at the brook Besor, and they went forth to meet David and to meet the people that [were] with him, and when David came near to the people, he saluted them with peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.22'>Then all the wicked men and [men] of Belial, of those that went with David, answered and said, Because they did not go with us, we will not give them of the spoil that we have recovered, except to each man his wife and his children, that they may lead [them] away, and depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.23'>Then David said, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD has given us, who has kept us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.24'>For who will hearken unto you in this matter? For as his part [is] that goes down to the battle, so [shall] his part [be] that remains by the stuff; they shall part alike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.25'>And it was [so] from that day forward that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.26'>And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, his friends, saying, Behold a blessing for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.27'>to [those] who [were] in Bethel and to [those] who [were] in Ramoth towards the Negev and to [those] who [were] in Jattir</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.28'>and to [those] who [were] in Aroer and to [those] who [were] in Siphmoth and to [those] who [were] in Eshtemoa</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.29'>and to [those] who [were] in Rachal and to [those] who [were] in the cities of the Jerahmeelites and to [those] who [were] in the cities of the Kenites</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.30'>and to [those] who [were] in Hormah and to [those] who [were] in Chorashan and to [those] who [were] in Athach</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.31'>and to [those] who [were] in Hebron and in all the places where David had been with his men.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.31'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.1'>Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines and fell down slain in Mount Gilboa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.2'>And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons, and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua, Saul's sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.3'>And the battle went heavily against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was sore afraid of the archers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.4'>Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword and thrust me through with it lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not, for he was sore afraid. Therefore, Saul took his sword and fell upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.5'>And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword and died with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.6'>So Saul died and his three sons and his armourbearer and all his men that same day together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.7'>And when the men of Israel that [were] on the other side of the valley and [those] that [were] on the other side of the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.8'>And it came to pass on the next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in Mount Gilboa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.9'>And they cut off his head and stripped off his weapons and sent them into the land of the Philistines round about to publish [it in] the house of their idols and among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.10'>And they put his weapons in the house of Ashtaroth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.11'>And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.12'>all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan and came to Jabesh and burnt them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.13'>And they took their bones and buried [them] under a tree at Jabesh and fasted seven days.:</verse>
