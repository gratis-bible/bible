      <chapter osisID='2Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'>Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians congregated in God our Father and in our Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>We must thank God always for you, brethren, as is due because your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of each and every one of you toward each other abounds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure and</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>in testimony of the just judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>seeing [it is] a just thing with God to recompense tribulation to those that trouble you</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>and to give you, who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with the angels of his power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>with flaming fire, to take vengeance on those that do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>who shall be punished with eternal destruction by the presence of the Lord and by the glory of his power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all those that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>Therefore in this manner we pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of his calling and fill each will with goodness and the work of faith with power</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be clarified in you, and ye in him, by the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>Now we beseech you, brethren, regarding the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>that ye not be easily shaken in understanding or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us, as if the day of Christ is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>Let no one deceive you by any means: for [that day shall not come] except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>opposing and exalting himself against all that is called God, or divinity, so that he as God sits in the temple of God, making himself appear to be God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>Remember ye not, that when I was yet with you, I told you these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>And ye know what impedes this now, that he might be revealed in his time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>For the mystery of iniquity is already working, except that he who dominates now will dominate until he is taken out of the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>And then shall that Wicked [one] be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the Spirit of his mouth and remove with the clarity of his coming:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>[that wicked one], who shall come by the working of Satan with great power and signs and lying miracles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>and with all deception of iniquity [working] in those that perish because they did not receive the charity of the truth, to be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>Therefore, for this cause, God shall send the operation of error in them, that they should believe the lie;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>that they all might be condemned who did not believe the truth, but consented to the iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to saving health through the sanctification of the Spirit and faith in [the] truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>unto which he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'>Therefore, brethren, stand fast and retain the doctrine which ye have been taught, whether by word or our epistle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God, even our Father, who has loved us and has given [us] eternal consolation and good hope through grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'>comfort your hearts and confirm you in every good word and work.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'>Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have [free] course and be glorified, even as [it is] with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'>And that we may be delivered from perverse and wicked men, for the faith is not of everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'>But the Lord is faithful, who shall confirm you and keep [you] from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'>And we have confidence in the Lord regarding you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'>And the Lord make your hearts upright in the charity of God and in the hope of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'>Now we charge you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks out of order, and not after the doctrine which ye received of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'>For you know in what manner you ought to imitate us, for we did not walk disorderly among you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'>neither did we eat any man's bread for nought, but working with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>Not because we did not have authority, but to give you an example that you might imitate us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>For even when we were with you, this we declared unto you, that if anyone desires not to work neither should he eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>For we hear that there are some who walk among you out of order, not working at all, but are busybodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>Now those that are such, we charge and exhort in our Lord Jesus Christ, that working with quietness, they eat their bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'>But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'>And if anyone does not hearken unto our word by this epistle, note that one and do not join with him, that he may be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'>Yet count [him] not as an enemy, but admonish [him] as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'>Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by every means. The Lord [be] with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'>[Receive] saving health from my hand, Paul, which is the sign in all [my] letters: so I write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.:</verse>
