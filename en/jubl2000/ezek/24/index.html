For her pieces, because of her pieces let it be removed; let no lot fall upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she did not poured it upon the ground, to cover it with dust;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>that wrath might rise up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the high place of the rock that it should not be covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Woe to the bloody city! I will also make a great fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>multiplying the wood, kindling the fire, to consume the flesh and to make the broth, and the bones shall be burned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>setting afterward the empty pot upon the coals thereof that it may become [red] hot and may burn and [that] the filthiness of it may be molten in it, [that] the scum of it may be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In fraud she has become weary, and her great scum did not go forth out of her; her scum [shall be] in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In thy perverse filthiness [thou shalt die] because I have cleansed thee, and thou didst not cleanse thyself from thy uncleanness; thou shalt never cleanse thyself again, until I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I, the LORD, have spoken: I came and worked. I will not turn back, neither will I have mercy, neither will I repent; according to thy ways and according to thy doings, they shall judge thee, said the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes by death; yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind thy turban upon thy head, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet and do not cover [thy] lips and do not eat the bread of comfort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So I spoke unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these [things are] to us, that thou doest [so]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the glory of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and the gift of your soul; your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover [your] lips nor eat the bread of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And your turbans [shall be] upon your heads and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities and cry out one with another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus Ezekiel shall be unto you for a sign: according to all that he has done ye shall do: and when this comes, ye shall know that I [am] the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Also, thou son of man, in the day when [I] take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and the care of their souls, their sons and their daughters,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that day [one that] escapes shall come unto thee, to bring the news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In that day thy mouth shall be opened [to speak] unto him who is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and no longer be dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
