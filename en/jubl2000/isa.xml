      <chapter osisID='Isa.1'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in [the] days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the LORD speaks, I have nourished and brought up sons, and they have rebelled against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib; [but] Israel does not know, my people do not have understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>O sinful nation, people laden with iniquity, generation of evildoers, corrupt sons! They have forsaken the LORD; they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger; they have turned back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>Why should I chastise you any more? Ye will revolt more and more; every head is sick, and every heart faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the sole of the foot even unto the head [there is] no soundness in him; [but] wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your country [is] desolate; your cities [are] burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and [it is] desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>Except the LORD of the hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, [and] we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Hear the word of the LORD, ye princes of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>To what purpose [is] the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? shall the LORD say. I am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; and I do not delight in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>When ye come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>Bring no more vain oblations; the incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot stand them; iniquity and the solemn meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; likewise, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>learn to do good; seek judgment; restore unto the oppressed; hear the fatherless in right [judgment]; protect the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>Then come, shall the LORD say, and we shall be even; if your sins were as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow; if they were red like crimson, they shall become as wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'>If ye are willing and hearken, ye shall eat the good of the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'>How is the faithful city become a harlot! It was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it, but now murderers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>Thy princes [are] rebellious and companions of thieves; every one loves bribes and follows after rewards; they do not hear the fatherless in judgment, neither does the cause of the widow come unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of the hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease myself of my adversaries and avenge myself of my enemies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>and I will turn my hand upon thee and according to pureness purge away thy dross and take away all thy tin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>and I will restore thy judges as at the first and thy counsellors as at the beginning; afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Zion shall be ransomed with judgment and her converts with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners [shall be] together, and those that forsook the LORD shall be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>For ye shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the groves that ye have chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf falls and as a garden that has no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>And the strong [idol] shall be as tow and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and no one [shall be able to] quench [them].:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'>And it shall come to pass in the last of the days [or times], [that] the mountain of the LORD'S house shall be confirmed as [the] head of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills; and all the Gentiles shall flow unto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'>And many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>And he shall judge among the Gentiles and shall rebuke many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>O house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are replenished from the east and [are] soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'>Their land is full of silver and gold, neither [is there any] end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither [is there any] end of their chariots:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>And the mean man bows down, and the great man humbles himself; therefore thou shalt not forgive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust from the terrible presence of the LORD and from the glory of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>For the day of the LORD of the hosts [shall be] upon every [one that is] proud and lofty and upon every [one that is] lifted up; and he shall be brought low:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>And upon all the cedars of Lebanon [that are] high and lifted up and upon all the oaks of Bashan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>and upon all the high mountains and upon all the hills [that are] lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>and upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>and upon all the ships of Tarshish and upon all pleasant pictures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'>And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low; and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'>And he shall utterly abolish the idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'>And they shall go into the holes of the rocks and into the caves of the earth, because of the terrible presence of the LORD and because of the glory of his majesty when he shall arise to smite the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'>In that day man shall cast his idols of silver and his idols of gold (which they made [each one] for himself to worship) into the caves of the moles and of the bats,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'>to go into the clefts of the rocks and into the caverns of the cliffs from before the fearful presence of the LORD and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall arise to smite the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'>Cease from man, whose breath [is] in his nostrils; for of what is he to be accounted of?:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'>For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of the hosts, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'>[the] mighty man and [the] man of war, [the] judge and [the] prophet, the fortune-teller and [the] ancient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'>[the] captain of fifty and [the] honourable man and [the] counsellor and [the] cunning artificer and [the] eloquent wise man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'>And I will give children [to be] their princes, and young [fools] shall rule over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'>And the people shall do violence, one against another, and each one against his neighbour; the child shall rise up against the ancient and the base against the honourable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'>When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, [saying], Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and [let] this ruin [be] under thy hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'>in that day he shall swear, saying, I will not be a healer for in my house [is] neither bread nor clothing: do not make me a ruler of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen because their tongue and their doings [have been] against the LORD, to irritate the eyes of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'>The appearance of their countenance witnesses against them, and they declare their sin as Sodom; they hide [it] not. Woe unto their soul! For they have rewarded evil unto themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'>Say unto the righteous that [it shall be] well [with him], for they shall eat of the fruit of their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'>Woe unto the wicked! [It shall be] ill [with him], for according to the work of his hands it shall be done unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>The oppressors of my people [are] many, and women rule over him. O my people, those who lead thee cause [thee] to err and twist the way of thy paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'>The LORD stands up to litigate and is [present] to judge the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'>The LORD will come with judgment against the elders of his people and against these his princes, for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor [is] in your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'>What do you mean [that] ye beat my people to pieces and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of the hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'>Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and swaggering [as] they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'>Therefore the Lord will make bare the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will uncover that which they are ashamed of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'>In that day the Lord will take away the adornment of [their] shoes and [their] hair nets and [their] crystals,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'>the chains and the jewels and the bracelets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'>the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the powders and the earrings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'>the rings, and nose jewels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.22'>the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the veils and the crisping pins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'>the [looking] glasses and the fine linen and the hoods and the hairdos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'>And it shall come to pass [that] instead of sweet perfumes, there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent and instead of well-set hair baldness and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth [and] burning instead of beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'>Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'>Thy gates shall lament and mourn, and she [being] desolate shall sit upon the ground.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'>And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'>In that day the branch of the LORD shall be for beauty and glory and the fruit of the earth for greatness and honour to those that are freed of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'>And it shall come to pass [that he that is] left in Zion and [he that] remains in Jerusalem shall be called holy, [even] every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.4'>When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.5'>And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion and upon the places of her assemblies a cloud and darkness by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night because over all glory [there shall be a] covering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.6'>And there shall be a covert for a shadow in the daytime from the heat and for a place of refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'>Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well-beloved had a vineyard in the horn of the sons of oil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'>and he had fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also made a winepress therein; and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? Therefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, did it bring forth wild grapes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'>And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up; [and] break down its wall, and it shall be trodden down:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'>And I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned, nor hoed; but briers and thorns shall come up there; I will even command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'>For the vineyard of the LORD of the hosts [is] the house of Israel and every man of Judah his pleasant plant; and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'>Woe unto those that join house to house [that] lay field to field until they have done away with the borders! Will ye dwell alone in the midst of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'>In my ears, the LORD of the hosts [said], Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, [even] great and fair, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'>For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'>Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning [that] they may continue their drunkenness; that continue until night [until] wine inflames them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'>And the harp and the viol, the tambourine and flutes and wine are in their feasts; but they do not regard the work of the LORD, nor consider the work of his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'>Therefore my people are gone into captivity because [they have] no knowledge; their glory died of hunger, and their multitude dried up of thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'>Therefore Sheol has enlarged himself and opened his mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude descended into it and their pomp and he that rejoiced in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'>And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'>But the LORD of the hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God, that is holy, shall be sanctified with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'>Then the lambs shall be fed after their manner, and strangers shall eat the fat ones that are forsaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'>Woe unto those that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'>that say, Let him make speed [and] hasten his work that we may see [it], and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come that we may know [it]!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.20'>Woe unto those that call evil good and good evil; that put darkness for light and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.21'>Woe unto [those that are] wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.22'>Woe unto [those that are] mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'>who justify the wicked for bribes and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'>Therefore as the fire devours the stubble and the flame consumes the chaff, [so] their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go away as dust because they have cast away the law of the LORD of the hosts and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'>Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them and has smitten them; and the mountains trembled, and their carcasses [were] torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand [is] stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'>And he will lift up a banner [as an example] to Gentiles that are far and will hiss unto those [that are] in the end of the earth; and behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'>None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'>whose arrows [are] sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and the [wheels of their chariots] like a whirlwind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'>their roaring [shall be] like a lion: they shall roar like young lions; they shall gnash their teeth and lay hold of the prey and shall carry [it] away safe, and none shall deliver [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'>And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea; and if [one] looks unto the land, behold darkness [and] sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'>Above it stood the seraphims; each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.3'>And one cried out unto another and said, Holy, holy, holy [is] the LORD of the hosts; the whole earth [is] full of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.4'>And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried out, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.5'>Then I said, Woe [is] me! for I am dead because I [am] a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of the hosts.</verse>
