And Saul caused the shofar to be blown throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And all Israel heard it said [that] Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines and also [that] Israel had become a stench unto the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people as the sand which [is] on the sea shore in multitude; and they came up and pitched camp in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people hid themselves in caves and in thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And [some of] the Hebrews went over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he [was] yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel [had appointed], but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were deserting from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Saul said, Bring me a burnt offering and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass that as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him that he might bless him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were leaving me and [that] thou didst not come within the days appointed and [that] the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>therefore, I said, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD. I forced myself, therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee, for now the LORD would have established thy kingdom over Israel for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But now thy kingdom shall not stand; the LORD has sought a man after his own heart unto whom the LORD has commanded that he be captain over his people because thou hast not kept [that] which the LORD commanded thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people [that were] present with him, about six hundred men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Saul and Jonathan, his son, and the people [that were] present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin, but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And three companies came out of the camp of the Philistines to destroy the land. One company turned unto the way [that leads to] Ophrah unto the land of Shual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Another company turned the way [to] Bethhoron, and another company turned [to] the way of the border that looks to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, Lest peradventure the Hebrews make swords or spears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen each man his share and his coulter and his axe and his mattock</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and when they had nicks in the mattocks and the coulters and the forks and the axes, or to fix a goad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So it came to pass in the day of battle that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that [were] with Saul and Jonathan except with Saul and with Jonathan his son who had them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
