Tell us how we shall return it to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but ye shall pay unto him the [expiation of] guilt; then ye shall be healed, and ye shall know why his hand was not removed from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said they, What shall be the [expiation of] guilt which we shall pay unto him? They answered, Five golden hemorrhoids and five golden rats, [according to] the number of the cardinals of the Philistines, for the same plague that is on you is also on your cardinals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore, ye shall make images of your hemorrhoids and images of your rats that destroy the land, and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel; peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you and from off your gods and from off your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Why then do ye harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had dealt [thus] among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now, therefore, make a new cart and take two milk cows, on which no yoke has been placed and tie the cows to the cart and bring their calves home from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then ye shall take the ark of the LORD and lay it upon the cart and put the jewels of gold, which ye pay him [for expiation of] guilt, in a coffer by the side thereof, and let it go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And see if it goes up by the way of his own border to Bethshemesh, [then] he has done us this great evil, but if not, then we shall know that [it is] not his hand [that] smote us; it [was] an accident [that] happened to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the men did so and took two milk cows and tied them to the cart and shut up their calves at home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart and the coffer with the rats of gold and the images of their hemorrhoids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the cows went straight down the way of Bethshemesh [and] went along the highway, lowing as they went and turned not aside [to] the right hand or [to] the left, and the cardinals of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And [those of] Bethshemesh [were] reaping their wheat harvest in the valley, and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark and rejoiced to see [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stopped there, for there was a great stone there; and they clave the wood of the cart and offered the cows in a burnt offering unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the coffer that [was] with it, in which [were] the jewels of gold, and put [them] on the great stone, and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the five cardinals of the Philistines had seen [it], they returned to Ekron the same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These, therefore are the golden hemorrhoids which the Philistines returned [in expiation] for their guilt unto the LORD, for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the golden rats, [according to] the number of all the cities of the Philistines [belonging] to the five cardinals; a ransom for those of the fenced cities and for the country dwellers even unto the great [stone of] Abel, upon which they placed the ark of the LORD in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite, and [this is remembered] unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>[Then] God smote those of Bethshemesh because they had looked at the ark of the LORD; he smote fifty thousand of the people and seventy [principal] men. And the people lamented because the LORD had smitten the people with such a great slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? And to whom shall he go up from us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD; come down, therefore, and carry it up to you.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
