thou didst say it with thy mouth and hast fulfilled [it] with thy hand, as [we see] this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore, now, LORD God of Israel, fulfill unto thy servant David, my father, what thou didst promise him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if thy sons keep their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be made firm, which thou didst speak unto thy servant David, my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, the heavens, the heavens of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have built?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prays before thee today,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, [even] toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there that thou may hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, thou shalt hearken unto the supplication of thy servant and of thy people Israel when they shall pray in this place and hear in thy dwelling place, from the heavens; please hear and forgive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When anyone shall have sinned against his neighbour, and an oath is laid upon him to cause him to swear and the oath comes before thy altar in this house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>thou shalt hear from heaven and do and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When thy people Israel are smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall turn again to thee and confess thy name and pray and make supplication with humility unto thee in this house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>then thou shalt hear in the heavens and forgive the sin of thy people Israel and bring them again unto the land which thou didst give unto their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee, if they pray in this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou hast afflicted them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>then thou shalt hear in the heavens and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people Israel, teaching them the good way in which they should walk and shalt give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>When there is famine in the land or pestilence or blasting or mildew or locusts or caterpillars, if their enemy besieges them in the land of their gates, whatever plague, whatever sickness [there is],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>every prayer and every supplication made by any man or by all thy people Israel, when anyone knows the plague of his own heart and spreads forth his hands toward this house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>then thou shalt hear in the heavens, in the habitation of thy dwelling place, and forgive and do and give to each one according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest (for thou, [even] thou only, knowest the hearts of all the sons of men),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou didst give unto our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Likewise concerning a stranger, that [is] not of thy people Israel, but comes out of a far country for thy name's sake</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>(for they shall have heard of thy great name and of thy strong hand and of thy stretched out arm), when he shall come to pray in this house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>thou shalt hear in the heavens, in the habitation of thy dwelling place, and do according to all that for which the stranger shall have called unto thee, that all peoples of the earth may know thy name and fear thee as [do] thy people Israel and that they may know that thy name is invoked upon this house, which I have built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>If thy people go out to battle against their enemies by the way which thou shalt send them and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen and [toward] the house that I have built for thy name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>thou shalt hear in the heavens their prayer and their supplication and do their judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>If they have sinned against thee (for [there is] no man that does not sin) and thou should be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and they return unto their heart in the land where they were carried captives and return and make supplication unto thee in the land of those that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned and have done iniquity, we have committed wickedness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and [so] convert themselves unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who led them away captive and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou didst give unto their fathers, [toward] the city which thou hast chosen and the house which I have built for thy name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>thou shalt hear in the heavens, in the habitation of thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplication and do what is right unto them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their rebellions by which they have rebelled against thee and cause those who carried them captive to have mercy on them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>for they [are] thy people and thy inheritance, which thou didst bring forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Let thine eyes be open unto the supplication of thy servant and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For thou didst separate them from among all the peoples of the earth, [to be] thy inheritance, as thou didst speak by the hand of Moses, thy servant, when thou didst bring our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And it was [so], that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands extended toward heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And he stood and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Blessed [be] the LORD that has given rest unto his people Israel according to all that he had said; not one word has failed of all his good word, which he spoke by the hand of Moses, his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The LORD our God be with us as he was with our fathers; let him not leave us nor forsake us</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his rights, which he commanded our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And let these my words, with which I have made supplication before the LORD, be near unto the LORD our God day and night that he maintain the judgment of his servant and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD [is] God, [and that there is] no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Let your heart, therefore, be perfect with the LORD our God, walking in his statutes and keeping his commandments, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Then the king and all Israel with him, offered sacrifices before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And Solomon offered sacrifices of peace, which he offered unto the LORD, [which were] twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the sons of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>That same day the king sanctified the middle of the court that [was] before the house of the LORD, for there he offered the burnt offerings and the presents and the fat of the peace [offerings] because the brasen altar that [was] before the LORD [was] too small to receive the burnt offerings and the presents and the fat of the peace [offerings].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And at that time Solomon held a feast and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, for seven days and another seven days, [even] fourteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they, blessing the king, went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done unto David, his servant, and unto Israel his people.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
