Solomon clave unto these in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For it came to pass when Solomon was old, [that] his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as [was] the heart of David, his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For Solomon went after Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom, the abomination of the Ammonites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD and went not fully after the LORD, as [did] David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the mount that [is] before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he did likewise for all his strange wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD became angry with Solomon because his heart was turned aside from the LORD God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he did not keep that which the LORD had commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Because this has been in thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I will not do it in thy days for David, thy father's sake, [but] I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, I will not rend away all the kingdom, [but] will give one tribe to thy son for David, my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad, the Edomite; he [was] of the king's seed in Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab, the captain of the host, had gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(for Joab dwelt there six months with all Israel until he had cut off every male in Edom),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad [being] yet a little child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they arose out of Midian and came to Paran; and taking men with them out of Paran, they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who gave him a house and appointed him food and gave him land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Hadad found great grace in the sight of Pharaoh so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Queen Tahpenes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath, his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab, the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart that I may go to my own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me that, behold, thou seekest to go to thy own land? And he answered, Nothing; however, let me go anyway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And God stirred him up [another] adversary, Rezon, the son of Eliadah, who fled from his lord Hadadezer, king of Zobah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band, when David slew those [of Zobah]; and they went to Damascus and dwelt there, and they made him king in Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the evil that Hadad [did], and he abhorred Israel and reigned over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Likewise Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name [was] Zeruah, a widow woman, lifted up his hand against the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this [was] why he lifted up [his] hand against the king: Solomon in building Millo, closed the breach of the city of David, his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the man Jeroboam [was] a mighty man of valour, and Solomon, seeing that the young man was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah, the Shilonite, found him in the way; and he [was] covered with a new garment; and the two [were] alone in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Ahijah caught the new garment that [was] on him and rent it [in] twelve pieces;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and he said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces for thyself, for thus hath said the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes to thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>because they have forsaken me and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh, the god of the Moabites, and Milcom, the god of the sons of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do [that which is] right in my eyes and [to keep] my statutes and my rights, as [did] David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I will not take any of his kingdom out of his hand, for I will make him prince all the days of his life for David, my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand and will give it unto thee, [even] ten tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And unto his son I will give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name in her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desires and shalt be king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee and wilt walk in my ways and do [that which is] right in my sight, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David, my servant, did, that I will be with thee and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will afflict the seed of David because of this, but not for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Solomon sought, therefore, to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt unto Shishak, king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the rest of the acts of Solomon and all that he did and his wisdom, [are] they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the days that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel [was] forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David, his father; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
