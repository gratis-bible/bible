because they were not perfect in following me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>except Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua, the son of Nun, for they were perfect in following the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the LORD'S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD was consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, behold, ye are risen up in the place of your fathers, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave you in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then they came near unto him and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock and cities for our little ones,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>but we ourselves will go arm ourselves and go with diligence before the sons of Israel until we have brought them unto their place, and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We will not return unto our houses until the sons of Israel have inherited each man his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan or forward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of Jordan eastward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will prepare yourselves to go before the LORD to the war</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and will all pass the Jordan armed before the LORD until he has driven out his enemies from before him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the land is subdued before the LORD, then afterward ye shall return and be guiltless before the LORD and before Israel, and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if ye will not do so, behold, ye shall have sinned against the LORD, and be sure your sin will catch up with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Our little ones, our wives, our livestock, and all our beasts, shall be there in the cities of Gilead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but thy servants, each one armed for war, will pass before the LORD to battle, as our lord saith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar, the priest, and Joshua, the son of Nun, and the princes of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said unto them, If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben will pass the Jordan with you, each one armed to battle, before the LORD, after the land shall be subdued before you, then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD has said unto thy servants, so will we do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance on this side of the Jordan [shall be] ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus Moses gave unto the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben and unto half the tribe of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with its cities and borders, [even] the cities of the country round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the sons of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and Atroth-shophan and Jaazer and Jogbehah</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and Bethnimrah and Bethharan, fenced cities, and also folds for sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon and Elealeh and Kirjathaim</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and Nebo and Baalmeon (their names being changed) and Shibmah and gave other names unto the cities which they built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, went to Gilead and took it and dispossessed the Amorite who [was] in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir, the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jair, the son of Manasseh also went and took the small towns thereof and called them Havothjair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Likewise Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages and called it Nobah, after his own name.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
