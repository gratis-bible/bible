Is this to be permitted them? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish on time? Will they resurrect the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which were burned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now Tobiah, the Ammonite, [was] by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox [were to] go up [it], he would break down their stone wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hear, O our God; for we are despised; and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of their captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And do not cover their iniquity, nor let their sin be blotted out from before thee, for they have become angry against the builders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But we built the wall, and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof, for the people were motivated to work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were sound [and] that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and conspired all of them together to come [and] to fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nevertheless, we made our prayer unto our God and set a watch over the [builders] day and night because of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and [there is] much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And our adversaries said, They shall not know or see until we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But it came to pass, that when the Jews who dwelt among them came, they advised us ten times of all the places from which they would come upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, I set in the lower places behind the wall, [and] on the higher places, I set the people by families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, Do not be afraid of them: remember the Lord, [who is] great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass when our enemies heard that we had understood it, God brought their counsel to nought, [and] we returned all of us to the wall, each one unto his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass from that time forth [that] half of the young men wrought in the work, and the other half of them held spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail; and the princes [were] behind all the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Those that built on the wall and those that bore burdens and those that laded wrought with one hand in the work and with the other held a weapon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the builders, each one had his sword girded by his side, and so they built. And he that sounded the shofar [was] by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I said unto the principals and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work [is] great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In whatever place that you hear the voice of the shofar, join us there; our God shall fight for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So we laboured in the work, and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let each one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that by night they may be a guard to us, and labour by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So neither I nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, each one put them off [only] for washing.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
