      <chapter osisID='Jer.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.1'>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that [were] in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.2'>To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.3'>It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.4'>Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.5'>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, [and] I ordained thee a prophet unto the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.6'>Then I said, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I do not know how to speak: for I [am] a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.7'>But the LORD said unto me, Do not say, I [am] a child; for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.8'>Do not be afraid of their faces; for I [am] with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.9'>Then the LORD put forth his hand and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.10'>See, I have placed thee in this day over Gentiles and over kingdoms, to root out, and to destroy, and to throw out, and to cast down, to build, and to plant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.11'>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.12'>Then the LORD said unto me, Thou hast seen well, for I will hasten my word to perform it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.13'>And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and its face [is] toward the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.14'>Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.15'>For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and each one shall set his seat at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem and near all its walls round about and near all the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.16'>And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods and worshipped the works of their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.17'>Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and thou shalt arise and speak unto them all that I shall command thee; do not fear them lest I confound thee before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.18'>For, behold, I have made thee this day as a defenced city and as an iron pillar and as [a] wall of brass upon all the earth against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.19'>And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I [am] with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.1'>Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.2'>Go and cry [out] in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD: I remember thee, the mercy of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou didst go after me in the wilderness, in a land [that was] not sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.3'>Israel [was] holiness unto the LORD [and] the firstfruits of his increase; all that devour him shall [be found] guilty; evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.4'>Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.5'>thus hath the LORD said, What iniquity have your fathers found in me that they are gone far from me and have walked after vanity and are become vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.6'>Neither did they say, Where [is] the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through and where no man dwelt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.7'>And I brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land and made my heritage an abomination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.8'>The priests did not say, Where [is] the LORD? and those that handled the law did not know me; the pastors also rebelled against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal and walked after [things that] do not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.9'>Therefore I will yet enter into judgment with you, saith the LORD, and I will plead with your children's children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.10'>For pass over the isles of Chittim and see; and send unto Kedar and consider diligently and see if there be such a thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.11'>Has a nation changed [their] gods? Even though they are not gods. But my people have changed their glory for [that which] does not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.12'>Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this; and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.13'>For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters to hew them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.14'>[Is] Israel a servant? [Is] he a homeborn [slave]? Why has he been [given over] as a prey?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.15'>The young lions roared upon him [and] yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are deserted without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.16'>Even the sons of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.17'>Could this not have come upon you peradventure because thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.18'>And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt? to drink the waters of the Nile? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria? to drink the waters of the river [Eufrates]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.19'>Thine own wickedness shall chastise thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee; know therefore and see how evil and bitter it is, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God and that my fear [is] lacking in thee, saith the Lord GOD of the hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.20'>For of old time I have broken thy yoke [and] burst thy bands; and thou didst say, I will not serve [sin]. With all this, upon every high hill and under every green tree thou dost wander, playing the harlot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.21'>Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, a seed of Truth, all of her; how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.22'>For though thou wash thee with nitre and take thee much soap, [yet] thine iniquity is sealed before me, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.23'>How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? See thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: [thou art] a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.24'>a wild ass used to the wilderness that breaths according to the desire of her soul; from her lust, who shall stop her? All those that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.25'>Withhold thy foot from being unshod and thy throat from thirst; but thou didst say, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.26'>As the thief is ashamed when he is taken, so shall the house of Israel be ashamed: they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.27'>saying to a [piece of] firewood, Thou [art] my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned [their] back unto me, and not [their] face: but in the time of their trouble they say, Arise and deliver us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.28'>But where [are] thy gods that thou hast made thee? Let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble, for [according to] the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.29'>Why will ye plead with me? Ye have all rebelled against me, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.30'>I have smitten your children in vain; they have received no correction; your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.31'>O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? Why do my people say, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.32'>Shall the virgin, perchance, forget her ornaments, [or] a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.33'>Why dost thou trim thy way to seek love? therefore thou hast also taught the wicked ones thy ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.34'>Even in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents; thou didst not find them in any trespass, but by all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.35'>Yet thou didst say, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee because thou hast said, I did not sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.36'>Why dost thou talk so much, changing thy ways? Thou shalt also be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.37'>Thou shalt also go forth from him with thine hands upon thine head; for the LORD has rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.1'>They say, If a man puts away his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man's, shall he return unto her again? Is she not a land that is now completely polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.2'>Lift up thine eyes unto the high places and see if there is anywhere thou hast not been ravished. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.3'>Therefore the rain has been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and thou dost have a whore's forehead, thou dost refuse to be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.4'>Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou [art] the guide of my youth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.5'>Will he reserve [his anger] for ever? will he keep [it] to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done as many evil things as thou could.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.6'>The LORD said unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen [that] which rebellious Israel has done? She is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.7'>And I said after she had done all these [things], Turn thou unto me. But she did not return. And her rebellious sister Judah saw [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.8'>And I saw when for all the causes by which rebellious Israel committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce; yet her rebellious sister Judah did not fear, but went and played the harlot also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.9'>And it came to pass through [her judging] her whoredom to be a light [thing] that the land became defiled and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.10'>And yet for all this her rebellious sister Judah has never turned unto me with her whole heart, but untruthfully, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.11'>And the LORD said unto me, The rebellious Israel has justified her soul in comparison to the treacherous Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.12'>Go and proclaim these words toward the north [wind] and say, Return, thou rebellious Israel, said the LORD [and] I will not cause my anger to fall upon you; for I [am] merciful, said the LORD, [and] I will not keep [anger] for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.13'>Only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou hast rebelled against the LORD thy God and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not heard my voice, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.14'>Turn, O rebellious sons, said the LORD; for I am your Lord, and I will take you one of a city and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.15'>And I will give you pastors according to my heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.16'>And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied and increased in the land; in those days, said the LORD, they shall no longer say, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit [it]; neither shall [that] be done any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.17'>At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the Gentiles shall congregate unto it in the name of the LORD in Jerusalem; neither shall they walk any more after the hardness of their evil heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.18'>In those times they shall go out from the house of Judah unto the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north [wind] to the land which I caused your fathers to inherit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.19'>But I said, How shall I place thee as sons and give thee the desirable land, the heritage that the hosts of Gentiles desire? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father and shalt not turn away from following me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.20'>Surely [as] the woman breaks the faith of her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.21'>A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping of the supplications of the sons of Israel; for they have perverted their way, [and] they have forgotten the LORD their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.22'>Return, ye rebellious sons, [and] I will heal your rebellion. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou [art] the LORD our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.23'>Truly the hills are vanity, the multitude of mountains; truly in the LORD our God [is] the salvation of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.24'>For shame has devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth: their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.25'>We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covers us; for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not hearkened unto the voice of the LORD our God.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.1'>If thou wilt return unto me, O Israel, said the LORD, thou shalt have rest; and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then thou shalt not go [into captivity].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.2'>And thou shalt swear, The LORD lives, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the Gentiles shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.3'>For thus has the LORD said to every man of Judah and of Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and do not sow among thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.4'>Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem lest my fury come forth like fire and burn [so] that no one can quench [it] because of the evil of your doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.5'>Declare ye in Judah and publish in Jerusalem and say, Blow ye the shofar in the land; cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.6'>Set up the banner in Zion: come together, do not delay: for I bring evil from the north [wind], and a great destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.7'>The lion is come up from his den, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; [and] thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.8'>For this, gird yourselves with sackcloth; lament and howl; for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.9'>And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, [that] the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.10'>(Then I said, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; when the sword reaches unto the soul).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.11'>At that time it shall be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places of the wilderness came toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.12'>A wind much more violent than these shall come unto me; for now I will also speak judgments against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.13'>Behold, he shall come up as a cloud, and his chariots as a whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us, for we are given over to be spoiled!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.14'>O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness that thou may be saved. How long shalt thou entertain the thoughts of thy iniquity within thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.15'>For the voice [is heard] from him who brings the news from Dan and from him who causes to hear the affliction from mount Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.16'>Say ye of the Gentiles; behold, cause it to be heard upon Jerusalem, Watchmen come from a far country and shall give out their voice upon the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.17'>As the watchmen of the heritages, they were upon her round about because she has been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.18'>Thy way and thy doings have procured these [things] unto thee; this [is] thy wickedness because it is bitter, because it reaches unto thine heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.19'>My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart makes a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the shofar, the alarm of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.20'>Destruction upon destruction is cried, for the whole land is destroyed; suddenly are my tents destroyed, [and] my curtains in a moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.21'>How long shall I see the banner [and] hear the voice of the shofar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.22'>For my people [are] foolish; the ignorant sons with no understanding have not known me; they [are] wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.23'>I beheld the earth, and, behold, [it was] without order, and empty; and the heavens, and they [had] no light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.24'>I beheld the mountains, and, behold, they trembled, and all the hills were destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.25'>I beheld, and, behold, [there was] no man, and all the birds of the heavens had fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.26'>I beheld, and, behold, Carmel was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of the LORD [and] by his fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.27'>For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet I will not make a full end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.28'>For this shall the earth be made desolate, and the heavens above be darkened because I spoke; I purposed and did not repent, neither will I turn back from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.29'>The whole city fled from the thunder of the horsemen and bowmen; they went into the thickets of the forests and climbed up upon the rocks; every city was forsaken, and not a man dwells therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.30'>And thou who art destroyed, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothe thyself with crimson, though thou deck thee with ornaments of gold, though thou paint thy eyes with antimony, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; [thy] lovers will despise thee; they will seek thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.31'>For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her that brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, [that] bewails herself, [that] spreads her hands, [saying], Woe [is] me now! for my soul is faint because of the murderers.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.5'>

        <verse osisID='Jer.46.4'>Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with [your] helmets; furbish the spears, [and] put on the brigandines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.46.5'>Why have I seen them dismayed [and] turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down and are fled in haste, and do not look back: [for] fear [was] round about, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.46.6'>Do not let the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they stumbled and fell toward the north by the river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.46.7'>Who [is] this [that] comes up as a flood, whose waters move as rivers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.46.8'>Egypt rises up like a flood, and [his] waters move like rivers; and he said, I will go up [and] will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and its inhabitants.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.46.11'>Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; [for] there is no cure for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.46.12'>The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry has filled the land; for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty, [and] they are both fallen together.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.46.28'>Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I [am] with thee; for I will make a full end of all the Gentiles where I have driven thee: but I will not make a full end of thee, but I will chastise thee with judgment; and I will not completely cut thee off.:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.48'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.1'>Against Moab thus hath the LORD of the hosts, the God of Israel said; Woe unto Nebo! for it is destroyed; it is confounded; Kiriathaim is taken; Misgab is confounded and dismayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.2'>Moab shall no longer be praised; they have devised evil against Heshbon, saying, Come, and let us cut it off from [being] a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.48.4'>Moab is destroyed; they have caused the cry of her little ones to be heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.5'>For in the ascending [road] of Luhith he that weeps shall go up weeping; for in the descending [road] of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.6'>Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.7'>For because thou hast trusted in thy works; in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken; and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity [with] his priests and his princes together.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.48.10'>Cursed [be] he that does the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed [be] he that keeps back his sword from blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.11'>Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into captivity; therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.48.26'>Make him drunken, for he magnified [himself] against the LORD; Moab shall also wallow in his vomit, and be in derision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.27'>For was not Israel a derision unto thee, as if he were found among thieves? for since thou hast spoken of him, thou hast slipped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.28'>O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities and dwell in the rock and be like the dove [that] makes her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.29'>We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness and his arrogancy and his pride and the haughtiness of his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.30'>I know his wrath, saith the LORD, but it shall have no effect; his lies shall not be to his advantage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.31'>Therefore I will weep over Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; [my heart] shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.32'>O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer; thy shoots are gone over the sea; they reach [even] to the sea of Jazer; the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.33'>And joy and gladness shall be taken from the plentiful field and from the land of Moab; and I shall cause wine to cease from the winepresses; no one shall tread with song; [their song shall be] no song.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.34'>The cry, from Heshbon [even] unto Elealeh, [and even] unto Jahaz, they have uttered their voice; from Zoar [even] unto Horonaim, [as] a heifer of three years old; for the waters of Nimrim shall also be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.35'>Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offers upon [an] altar and him that burns incense to his gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.36'>Therefore my heart shall sound like flutes for Moab, and my heart shall sound like flutes for the men of Kirheres because the riches [that] he has gotten are perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.37'>For every head [shall be] bald, and every beard shaved: upon all the hands [shall be] cuttings, and upon all the loins sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.38'>[There shall be] lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab and in the streets thereof; for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which there [is] no pleasure, said the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.48.41'>The cities are taken, and the strong holds are taken, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.42'>And Moab shall be destroyed from [being] a people because he has magnified [himself] against the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.43'>Fear and the pit and the snare [shall be] upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.44'>He that flees from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare; for I will bring upon him, [even] upon Moab, the year of their visitation, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.45'>Those that fled from the force stood under the shadow of Heshbon; because fire came forth out of Heshbon and a flame from the midst of Sihon and burned the corner of Moab and the crown of the head of the rebellious sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.46'>Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh have perished; for thy sons are taken prisoners into captivity, and thy daughters [are] captives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.48.47'>Yet I will turn again the captivity of Moab in the last of the times, said the LORD. Thus far [is] the judgment of Moab.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.49.3'>Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled; cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird yourselves with sackcloth; lament and run to and fro by the hedges, for their king shall go into captivity, [and] his priests and his princes together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.49.4'>Why gloriest thou in the valleys? Thy valley has slipped, O backsliding daughter that trusted in her treasures, she that saith, Who shall come against me?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.49.9'>If grapegatherers came against thee, would they not leave [some] gleaning grapes? If thieves by night, they will take what they have need of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.49.10'>But I will make Esau bare, I will uncover his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself; his seed shall be destroyed, and his brethren and his neighbours and he shall no longer be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.49.11'>Leave thy fatherless children; I will raise them; and thy widows shall trust in me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.49.13'>For I have sworn by myself, said the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all its cities shall be perpetual wastes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.49.14'>I have heard the news, that from the LORD a messenger had been sent unto the Gentiles, [saying], Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</verse>
