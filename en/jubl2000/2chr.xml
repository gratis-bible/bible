      <chapter osisID='2Chr.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.1'>And Solomon, the son of David, was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God [was] with him and magnified him exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.2'>Then Solomon spoke unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every prince in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.3'>So Solomon and all the congregation with him went to the high place that [was] at Gibeon, for there was the tabernacle of the testimony of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.4'>But David had brought the ark of God up from Kirjathjearim to [the place which] David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.5'>Moreover, the brasen altar that Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made [was] there before the tabernacle of the LORD; and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.6'>And Solomon went up there to the brasen altar before the LORD, which [was] at the tabernacle of the testimony, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.7'>And that night God appeared unto Solomon and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.8'>And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast showed great mercy unto David, my father, and hast placed me as king in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.9'>Now, O LORD God, let thy word unto David, my father, be established, for thou hast placed me as king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.10'>Give me now wisdom and knowledge that I may go out and come in before this people, for who can judge this thy people, [that is so] great?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.11'>And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth or glory, nor the life of thy enemies, neither yet hast asked long life, but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou may judge my people, over whom I have placed thee as king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.12'>wisdom and knowledge [is] granted unto thee; and I will also give thee riches and wealth and glory such as none of the kings have had that [have been] before thee, neither shall any after thee have the like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.13'>Then Solomon returned to Jerusalem from the high place that [was] at Gibeon, from before the tabernacle of the testimony, and reigned over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.14'>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen, and he had a thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.15'>And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as [plenteous] as stones, and he made cedar trees as the sycamore trees that [are] in the vale for abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.16'>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn; the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.17'>And they went up and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred [shekels] of silver and a horse for one hundred and fifty; and so they brought out [horses] for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria, by their hands.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.1'>And Solomon determined to build a house for the name of the LORD and a house for his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.2'>And Solomon counted seventy thousand men to bear burdens and eighty thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.3'>And Solomon sent to Hiram, the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David, my father, sending him cedars to build himself a house to dwell in, [even so deal with me].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.4'>Behold, I must build a house unto the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate [it] to him [and] to burn aromatic incense before him and for the continual showbread and for the burnt offerings morning and evening on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God, which is to be perpetual in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.5'>And the house which I must build [is] great, for great [is] our God above all gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.6'>But who is so powerful as to build him a house, seeing the heavens and heavens of the heavens cannot contain him? Who [am] I then that I should build him a house, except to burn incense before him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.7'>Send me now, therefore, a wise man who knows how to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in iron and in purple and crimson and blue and that knows how to engrave figures with the craftsmen that [are] with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David, my father, provided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.8'>Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and pine trees, out of Lebanon, for I know that thy servants are skillful at cutting timber in Lebanon, and, behold, my servants [shall] be with thy servants</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.9'>to prepare me timber in abundance, for the house which I am about to build [shall be] great and wonderful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.10'>And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.11'>Then Hiram, the king of Tyre, answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD has loved his people, he has placed thee as king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.12'>Hiram said, moreover, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel, that made the heavens and the earth, who has given to King David a wise son with knowledge, good sense and understanding, that he might build a house for the LORD and a house for his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.13'>And now I have sent a wise man, with knowledge and understanding, of Hiram my father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.14'>the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, in fine linen, and in crimson; also to engrave any manner of figure and to invent any design which shall be put to him, with thy craftsmen and with the craftsmen of my lord David, thy father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.15'>Now, therefore, let my lord send unto his servants the wheat and the barley the oil and the wine, which he has spoken of;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.16'>and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need, and we will bring it to thee in rafts by sea to Joppa, and thou shalt cause it to be carried up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.17'>And Solomon numbered all the strangers that [were] in the land of Israel, after David, his father, had already numbered them; and one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred were found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.18'>And he set seventy thousand of them [to be] bearers of burdens and eighty thousand [to be] hewers in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred overseers to make the people work.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.1'>Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in the Mount Moriah which had been shown unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan, the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.2'>And he began to build in the second [day] of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.3'>Now these [are the measurements on which] Solomon founded the building of the house of God. The first measurement was the length of sixty cubits and the breadth of twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.4'>And the porch that [was] in the front of the length was of twenty cubits, according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height [was] one hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.5'>And the greater house he covered with fir wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.6'>And he [also] covered the house with precious stones for beauty, and the gold [was] gold of Parvaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.7'>Thus did he cover the house, its beams, its posts, its walls, and its doors, with gold and engraved cherubim on the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.8'>And he made the house of the holy of holies, its length was twenty cubits, according to the breadth of the house, and its breadth was twenty cubits, and he covered it with fine gold, [amounting] to six hundred talents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.9'>And the weight of the nails [was] fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.10'>And inside the house of the holy of holies he made two cherubim of figured work and overlaid them with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.11'>And the wings of the cherubim [were] twenty cubits long; one wing [of the one cherub was] five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing [was likewise] five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.12'>And [one] wing of the other cherub [was] five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing [was] five cubits [also], joining to the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.13'>The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits, and they stood on their feet, and their faces [were] inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.14'>And he made the veil [of] blue and purple and crimson and fine linen and wrought cherubim thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.15'>Also he made in front of the house two pillars of thirty-five cubits high, and the chapiter that [was] on the top of each of them [was] five cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.16'>And he made chains, [as] in the oracle, and put [them] on the heads of the pillars and made one hundred pomegranates and put [them] on the chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.17'>And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left, and called the name of the one on the right hand Jachin, and the name of the one on the left Boaz.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.1'>Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.2'>He also made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, entirely round and five cubits high; and a line of thirty cubits girded it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.3'>And under it [were] figures of oxen, which did compass it round about, ten in each cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two orders of oxen [were] cast, when it was cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.4'>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the Negev and three looking toward the east; and the sea [was set] above upon them, and all their hinder parts [were] inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.5'>And the thickness of it [was] a handbreadth and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies, [and] it received and held three thousand baths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.6'>He also made ten lavers and put five on the right hand and five on the left, to wash in them; they cleansed the work of the burnt offering in them; but the sea [was] for the priests to wash in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.7'>And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set [them] in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.8'>He also made ten tables and placed [them] in the temple, five on the right hand and five on the left. And he made one hundred basins of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.9'>Furthermore, he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid the doors of them with brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.10'>And he set the sea on the right side towards the east, over against the Negev.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.11'>And Hiram made the pots and the shovels and the basins. And Hiram finished the work, that he had been making for King Solomon for the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.12'>Two pillars and the pommels and the chapiters, [which were] on the top of the two pillars, and the two networks to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which [were] on the top of the pillars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.13'>four hundred pomegranates on the two networks; two orders of pomegranates on each network, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which [were] upon the pillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.14'>He also made the bases upon which he placed the lavers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.15'>one sea, and twelve oxen under it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.16'>and the pots and the shovels and the fleshhooks and all their vessels, did Hiram, his father, make to King Solomon for the house of the LORD of the purest brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.17'>In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in clay of the ground, between Succoth and Zeredathah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.18'>Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance, for the weight of the brass could not be found out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.19'>And Solomon made all the vessels that [were for] the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables upon which the showbread [was set];</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.20'>likewise, the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.21'>and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs, [he made of] gold, of perfect gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.22'>also the snuffers and the basins and the spoons and the censers, [of] pure gold. [Regarding] the entry of the house, its inner doors for the most holy [place] and the doors of the house of the temple, [were of] gold.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.1'>Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished, and Solomon brought in [all] the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver and the gold and all the vessels, he put among the treasures of the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.2'>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the families of the sons of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which [is] Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.3'>Therefore, all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the solemnity which [was] in the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.4'>And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.5'>And they brought up the ark and the tabernacle of the testimony and all the vessels of the sanctuary that [were] in the tabernacle; these did the priests [and] the Levites bring up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.6'>Also King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.7'>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.8'>For the cherubim spread forth [their] wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its staves from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.9'>And they drew out the staves so that the ends of the staves of the ark could be seen before the oracle, but they could not be seen from outside. And they were there unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.10'>[There was] nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses put [in it] at Horeb, with which the LORD had cut a covenant with the sons of Israel when they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.11'>And when the priests came out of the sanctuary (for all the priests [that were] present were sanctified [and] did not [then] wait by course,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.12'>and the Levite singers, all of those of Asaph, those of Heman, and those of Jeduthun, together with their sons and their brethren, [being] clothed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets).</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.13'>And they sounded the trumpets and sang with one voice, all together as one [man] praising and thanking the LORD, when they lifted up [their] voice with trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, when they praised the LORD, [saying], For [he is] good, for his mercy [endures] for ever; and the house was filled with a cloud, [even] the house of the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.14'>so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.1'>Then Solomon said, The LORD has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.2'>I, therefore, have built a house of habitation for thee and a place for thy dwelling for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.3'>And the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation of Israel, and all the congregation of Israel was standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.4'>And he said, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel, who has with his hand fulfilled [that] which he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.5'>Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither did I choose any man to be a prince over my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.6'>But I have chosen Jerusalem that my name might be there and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.7'>Now it was in the heart of David, my father, to build a house unto the name of the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.8'>But the LORD said to David, my father, Forasmuch as it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thy heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.9'>notwithstanding, thou shalt not build the house, but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build a house for my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.10'>The LORD, therefore, has performed his word that he has spoken, for I am risen up in the place of David, my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD had said, and have built the house unto the name of the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.11'>And in it I have put the ark, in which [is] the covenant of the LORD that he made with the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.12'>[Then] he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel and spread forth his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.13'>For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, five cubits long and five cubits wide and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood and knelt down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.14'>and said, O LORD God of Israel, [there is] no God like thee in the heaven nor in the earth who keeps covenant and [shows] mercy unto thy servants that walk before thee with all their hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.15'>who hast kept unto thy servant David, my father, that which thou hast promised him; thou didst say it with thy mouth and hast fulfilled [it] with thy hand, as [it is] this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.16'>Now, therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David, my father, that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel, under the condition that thy sons keep their way, walking in my law, as thou hast walked before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.17'>Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word stand firm, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.18'>Is it true that God is to dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee, how much less this house which I have built!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.19'>But thou shalt look upon the prayer of thy servant and upon his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer with which thy servant prays before thee</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.1'>And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had confirmed the kingdom and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.2'>And it came to pass [that] in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem, because they had rebelled against the LORD,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.4'>And he took the fenced cities which [pertained] to Judah and came to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.5'>Then Shemaiah, the prophet, went to Rehoboam and [to] the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus hath the LORD said, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore, I have also left you in the hand of Shishak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.6'>And the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD [is] righteous.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.8'>Nevertheless, they shall be his servants that they may know what it is to serve me and to serve the kingdoms of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.9'>So Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house; he took it all; he also carried away the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.10'>And in their place King Rehoboam made shields of brass and committed [them] to the hands of the princes of the guard that kept the entrance of the king's house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.12'>And, behold, God himself [is] with us for [our] captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the LORD God of your fathers, for ye shall not prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.13'>But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them; so they were before Judah, and the ambush [was] behind them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.8'>And Asa had an army [of men] that bore shields and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand; all these [were] mighty men of valour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.9'>And there came out against them Zerah, the Ethiopian, with a host of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and came unto Mareshah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.1'>Joash [was] seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name [was] Zibiah of Beersheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.2'>And Joash did [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada, the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.3'>And Jehoiada took for him two wives, and he begat sons and daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.4'>And it came to pass after this [that] Joash desired to repair the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.5'>And he gathered together the priests and the Levites and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and be diligent in this matter. However the Levites were not diligent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.6'>Therefore the king called for Jehoiada, the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem unto the tabernacle of the testimony the collection, [according to the commandment] of Moses, the servant of the LORD and of the congregation of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.7'>For the wicked woman, Athaliah, and her sons had broken up the house of God, and they had also bestowed all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD upon Baalim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.8'>And at the king's commandment they made an ark and set it outside at the gate of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.9'>And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem to bring in to the LORD the collection [that] Moses the servant of God [laid] upon Israel in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.10'>And all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in and cast into the ark until they had fulfilled [their duty].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.11'>Now it came to pass, that at what time the ark was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites and when they saw that [there was] much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the ark and took it and returned it to its place. Thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.12'>And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those that did the work of the service of the house of the LORD and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD and also those that wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.13'>So the workmen wrought, and by their hands the work was done, and they restored the house of God and strengthened it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.14'>And when they had finished [it], they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, of which they made vessels for the house of the LORD, vessels to minister and to offer [with], and spoons and vessels of gold and silver.

        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.5'>Moreover, Amaziah gathered Judah together and made them captains over thousands and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of [their] fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and above and found them three hundred thousand choice [men], [able] to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.6'>He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.17'>Then Amaziah, king of Judah, took advice and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another face to face.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.5'>So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem because for a long [time] they had not done it as it is written.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.17'>For [there were] yet many in the congregation that were not sanctified; therefore, the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for each one [that was] not clean, to sanctify [them] unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.18'>For a multitude of the people, [even] many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, and they ate the passover not as it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon each one</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.19'>[that] has prepared his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, even though [he is] not [cleansed] according to the purification of the sanctuary.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.24'>For Hezekiah, king of Judah, had given to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep, and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep, and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.25'>And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.7'>In addition to this, he set a graven image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen over all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name for ever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.8'>neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers under the condition that they take, keep, and do all that I have commanded them, the whole law, the statutes and the rights by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.9'>So Manasseh deceived Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to do more evil than the Gentiles, whom the LORD had destroyed before the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.10'>And the LORD spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they would not hearken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.11'>Therefore, the LORD brought upon them the princes of the host of the king of Assyria who took Manasseh and bound him with fetters of brass and carried him to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.12'>And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.13'>and when he prayed unto him, he was heard; for he heard his supplication and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD [was] God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.14'>Now after, this he built the wall outside the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, and at the entrance of the fish gate, and fenced Ophel and raised it up to a very great height and put captains of the army in all the fenced cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.15'>Likewise, he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the LORD and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD and in Jerusalem and cast [them] out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.16'>And he repaired the altar of the LORD and sacrificed upon it sacrifices of peace and of praise and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.17'>Nevertheless, the people still sacrificed in the high places, [yet] unto the LORD their God only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.18'>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they [are written] in the acts of the kings of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.19'>His prayer also and how he was heard, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places upon which he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he humbled himself; behold, these things are written among the words of the seers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.20'>So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house; and Amon, his son, reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.21'>Amon [was] twenty-two years old when he began to reign and reigned two years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.22'>But he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, as Manasseh his father had done, for Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh, his father, had made, and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.23'>But he never humbled himself before the LORD as Manasseh, his father, humbled himself; to the contrary Amon multiplied the guilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.24'>And his servants conspired against him and slew him in his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.25'>But the people of the land slew all those that had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah, his son, king in his stead.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.3'>For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David, his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places and the groves and the graven images and the molten images.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.4'>And they broke down the altars of the Baalim in his presence; and the images [of the sun], that [were] on high above them, he cut down; and the groves and the graven images and the molten images, he broke in pieces and made dust [of them] and scattered [it] upon the graves of those that had sacrificed unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.5'>And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.6'>[He did the same] in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their swords round about.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.8'>Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah, the son of Joahaz, the writer of chronicles, to repair the house of the LORD his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.9'>And they went to Hilkiah, the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim and of all the remnant of Israel and of all Judah and Benjamin, having [then] returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.10'>And they put [it] in the hand of those that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and restore the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.11'>They [also] gave to the craftsmen and builders, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and for the woodwork of the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.12'>And the men did the work faithfully, and the overseers of them [were] Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of Kohath, to set [it] forward; and [others of] the Levites, all those with understanding in instruments of music.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.13'>Also [they were] over the bearers of burdens and [were] overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service; and of the Levites [there were] scribes, and officers, and porters.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.15'>And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan, the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.21'>Go, enquire of the LORD for me and for the remnant of Israel and of Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found, for great [is] the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according to all the things that are written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.22'>Then Hilkiah and those of the king went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the house of doctrine); and they spoke to her to that [effect].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.23'>And she answered them, The LORD God of Israel hath said thus, Tell the man that sent you to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.24'>that thus hath the LORD said, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.25'>because they have forsaken me and have sacrificed unto other gods, provoking me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore, my wrath shall be poured out upon this place and shall not be quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.26'>But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus hath the LORD God of Israel said, [Because] thou hast heard the words [of the book],</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.27'>and thy heart became tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, hearing his words against this place and against its inhabitants [and] didst humble thyself before me and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me, I also have heard thee, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.28'>Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace; neither shall thy eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.29'>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.30'>And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and with him all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the Levites and all the people, great and small; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.31'>And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and that they would keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and with all their soul to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.32'>And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand [to it]. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.33'>And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the lands that [pertained] to the sons of Israel and made all that were present in Israel serve the LORD their God [only]. [And] all his days they did not depart from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.35'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.1'>Moreover, Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem and they killed the passover on the fourteenth [day] of the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.2'>And he set the priests in their charges and confirmed them in the ministry of the house of the LORD</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.3'>and said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, who were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel, built, that ye not carry it any longer upon your shoulders; serve now the LORD your God and his people Israel</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.4'>and prepare [yourselves] by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David, king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon, his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.5'>And stand in the sanctuary according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren, the people, and [after] the division of the families of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.6'>So kill the passover and sanctify yourselves and prepare your brethren, that [they] may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.7'>And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks; these [were] of the king's substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.8'>And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand six hundred [sheep] and three hundred oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.9'>Conaniah, likewise, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, princes of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the sacrifices of the passover five thousand [sheep], and five hundred oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.10'>So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites, likewise, in their courses, according to the king's commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.11'>And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled [the blood taken] from the hands of the Levites [who] flayed [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.12'>And they took away [part of the animals that they had] for the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, for them to offer unto the LORD, as [it is] written in the book of Moses. And [they did], likewise, with the oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.13'>And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance, but that which had been sanctified, they cooked in pots and in caldrons and in pans and divided [them] speedily among all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.14'>And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were occupied in the sacrifice of the burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore, the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.15'>Likewise, the singers, the sons of Asaph, [were] in their place, according to the commandment of David and Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, the king's seer; and the porters [waited] at every gate; it was not necessary for them to depart from their ministry, for their brethren, the Levites, prepared for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.16'>So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover and to sacrifice the burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of King Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.17'>And the sons of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time and the solemn feast of unleavened bread for seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.18'>And there was no passover like unto that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel, the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests and the Levites and all Judah and Israel that were present, together with all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.19'>In the year eighteen of the reign of Josiah, this passover was kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.20'>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the house, Necho, king of Egypt, came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.21'>But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? [I do] not [come] against thee this day, but against the house that makes war with me, for God commanded me to make haste. Forbear from [meddling with] God, who [is] with me, that he not destroy thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.22'>Nevertheless, Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and did not hearken unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight him in the valley of Megiddo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.23'>And the archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, Take me away, for I am sore wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.24'>His servants, therefore, took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.25'>And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah; and all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day and made them an ordinance in Israel, which [are] written in the lamentations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.26'>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his mercy, according to [that which was] written in the law of the LORD,</verse>
