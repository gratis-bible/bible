and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Contend with your mother, contend: for she [is] not my wife, neither [am] I her husband: let her therefore remove her whoredoms from her face and her adulteries from between her breasts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>lest I strip her naked and set her as in the day that she was born and make her as a wilderness and set her like a dry land and slay her with thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Neither will I have mercy upon her sons, for they [are] the sons of whoredoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For their mother has played the harlot; she that conceived them has been shamed; for she said, I will go after my lovers that give [me] my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns and make a wall that she shall not find her paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find [them]; then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then [it was] better with me than now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For she did not recognize that I gave her the wheat and the wine and the oil and multiplied unto them the silver and the gold, [with which] they made Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore I will return and take away my wheat in the time thereof and my wine in the season thereof and will recover my wool and my flax that [I]had given to cover her nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now [I] will uncover her folly in the sight of her lovers, and no one shall deliver her out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast, her new moon, and her sabbath, and all her festivities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will cause her vine and her fig tree to be cut down, of which she has said, These [are] my wages that my lovers have given me; and I will reduce them to a thicket, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will visit upon her the times of the Baals, unto whom she burned incense, and she adorned herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, oblivious of me, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, behold, I will induce her and bring her into the wilderness and speak unto her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will give her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall be in that time, saith the LORD, [that] thou shalt call me My Husband, and shalt no longer call me Baali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will take away the names of Baals out of her mouth, and they shall no longer be remembered by their name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in that time I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of the heaven and [with] the serpents of the earth; and I will break [the] bow and [the] sword and [the] battle of the earth and will cause them to sleep safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I will even betroth thee unto me in faith: and thou shalt know the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, I will respond, saith the LORD, I will respond to the heavens, and they shall respond to the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the earth shall respond to the wheat and the wine and the oil; and they shall respond to Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon Loruhamah, and I will say to Loammi, Thou [art] my people;
