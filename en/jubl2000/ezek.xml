      <chapter osisID='Ezek.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>Now it came to pass at thirty years, in the fourth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I [was] among the captives by the river of Chebar, [that] the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>In the fifth [day] of the month, which [was] the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>the word of the LORD came [expressly] unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and there the hand of the LORD came upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, and [a] great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness [was] about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>Also out of the midst thereof [came] the likeness of four living creatures. And this [was] their appearance: they had the likeness of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>And each one had four faces, and four wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>And their feet [were] straight feet; and the sole of their feet [was] like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like the colour of highly burnished brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>And [they had] the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and their faces and their wings on [all] four sides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>With their wings they joined one to another; they did not return when they went; they went each one straight in the direction they were facing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>And the likeness of their faces was human faces; and lion faces, on the right side; and they four had ox faces on the left side; likewise they four had eagle faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>Thus [were] their faces; and their wings [were] stretched upward; two [wings] of each one [were] joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>And they went each one straight forward in the direction they were facing: wherever the Spirit directed them to go, they went; [and] they did not return when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance [was] like burning coals of fire [and] like the appearance of [lit] torches; the [fire] went up and down among the living creatures and the brightness of the fire; and out of the fire went forth lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>And the living creatures ran and turned as the appearance of lightnings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold a wheel upon the earth with its four rims by the living creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>The appearance of the wheels and their work [was] like unto the colour of a [stone of] Tarsis [or beryl]; and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their workmanship [was] as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>When they went, they went upon their four sides: [and] they did not return when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>And their ribs were high and dreadful, and full of eyes round about them in all four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went with them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>Wherever the spirit wished to go, they went; wherever the spirit directed them, the wheels also rose up after them: for the spirit of the living creatures [was] in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>When those went, [these] went; and when those stood, [these] stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up after them: for the spirit of the living creatures [was] in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>And over the heads of each living creature there appeared a heaven like a marvellous crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>And under the heaven their wings [were] straight one toward the other: each one had two, and another two which covered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, as the voice of the Almighty, when they went; the voice of the word, as the voice of an army. When they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>And there was heard a voice from the heaven that [was] over their heads, when they stood, [and] had let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>And above the heaven that [was] over their heads [was] the figure of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the figure of the throne [was] a likeness as the appearance of a man seated upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>And I saw something that looked like the colour of amber, that appeared to have fire round about within it, which could be seen from his loins upward; and from his loins downward, I saw what looked like fire, and it had brightness round about</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>that looked like the bow of heaven that is in the clouds in the day of rain, so [was] the appearance of the brightness round about. This [was] the vision of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And I saw it and fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>And spirit entered into me when he spoke unto me and set me upon my feet, and I heard him that spoke unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the sons of Israel, to rebellious Gentiles that have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have rebelled against me, [even] unto this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>And to sons [that have] hard faces and strong hearts do I send thee; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>And they will not hear nor forbear (for they [are] a rebellious house), but they shall know that there has been a prophet among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>And thou, son of man, do not be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, for they are rebels; though thou find thyself among thorns and thy dwelling be with briers, do not be afraid of their words, nor fear before them, for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>And thou shalt speak my words unto them, but they will not hear nor forbear, for they are rebels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Do not be rebellious like the rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat what I give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>And I looked, and behold, [a] hand was sent unto me; and in it was [the] roll of a book,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>and he spread it before me; and it [was] written within and without; and [there was] written therein lamentations and mourning and woes.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>And he said unto me, Son of man, eat what thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. I ate it and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>Then he said unto me, Son of man, go and enter into the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>For thou [art] not sent to a people of a profound speech nor of a hard language, [but] to the house of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>not to many peoples of profound speech nor of hard language, whose words thou can not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>But the house of Israel will not desire to hear; for they do not desire to hear me: for all the house of Israel [are] impudent and hardhearted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>As diamond harder than flint I have made thy forehead: do not fear them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they [are] a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>And go, and enter in among the captives, unto the sons of thy people, and thou shalt speak unto them, and tell them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said, They will not hear, nor forbear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>And the Spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of great thunder of the blessed glory of the LORD [leaving] his place,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>and the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of great thunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>And the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>And I came unto the captives at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there disheartened among them seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>And it came to pass at the end of the seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>Son of man, I have placed thee as a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die and thou dost not give him warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, that he might live, the same wicked [man] shall die for his iniquity; but his blood I will require at thine hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>Yet if thou warn the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness nor from his wicked way, he shall die for his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>Again, When the righteous [man] turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die because thou hast not given him warning; he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous [man] that the righteous not sin and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>And the hand of the LORD came upon me there; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will talk with thee there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>Then I arose and went forth into the plain, and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar; and I fell on my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>Then spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet, and [he] spoke with me and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>And thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth that thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they [are] a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: He that hears, let him hear, and he that forbears; let him forbear: for they [are] a rebellious house.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.1'>Thou also, son of man, take a tile and lay it before thee and portray upon it the city of Jerusalem</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.2'>and lay siege against it and build a fort against it and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set [battering] rams against it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.3'>And take an iron pan and set it [for] a wall of iron between thee and the city; and set thy face against it and it shall be for an encompassment, and thou shalt lay siege against the [city]. This [shall be] a sign to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.4'>Thou shalt sleep upon thy left side and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it; [according] to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.5'>For I have summed up [for] thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.6'>And when thou hast accomplished them, thou shalt sleep on thy right side [this] second time, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: [a] day for [a] year; I have appointed thee [each] day for [a] year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.7'>Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm [shall be] uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.8'>And, behold, I laced bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn from one side to another until thou hast ended the days [appointed thee] upon thy sides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.9'>Take also unto thee wheat and barley and beans and lentils and millet and fitches and put them in one vessel and make thee bread thereof, [according] to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.10'>And thy food which thou shalt eat [shall be] by weight, twenty shekels a day; from time to time shalt thou eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.11'>Thou shalt also drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin; from time to time shalt thou drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.12'>And thou shalt eat barley cakes baked under the ashes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that comes out of man, in their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.13'>And the LORD said, Even thus shall the sons of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.14'>Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul is not defiled: for from my youth up even until now have I not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither has abominable flesh come into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.15'>Then he said unto me, Behold, I give thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.16'>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I break the sustenance of bread in Jerusalem; and they shall eat bread by weight, and with anguish; and they shall drink water by measure, and with terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.17'>For they shall lack bread and water, and terrorize one another, and faint because of their iniquity.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.1'>And thou, son of man, take a sharp knife, take a barber's razor, and cause [it] to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard; then take balances to weigh, and divide the [hair].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.2'>Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part [and] smite about it with a knife; and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.3'>Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number and bind them in the skirt of thy garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.4'>Then take of them again and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire; [for] thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.5'>Thus hath the Lord GOD said: This [is] Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst of the Gentiles and of the lands [that are] round about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.6'>And she has changed my judgments and my statutes into wickedness more than the Gentiles and more than the lands that [are] round about her; for they have disregarded my judgments and my commandments and have not walked in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.7'>Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because [I] multiplied you more than the Gentiles that [are] round about you, ye have not walked in my commandments, neither have ye kept my judgments. Ye have not even acted according to the judgments of the Gentiles that [are] round about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.8'>Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I, even I, [am] against thee and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.9'>And I will do in thee that which I have not done and whereunto I will not do any more the like because of all thine abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.10'>For the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee I will scatter into all the winds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.11'>Therefore, [as] I live, said the Lord GOD, surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy contaminations and with all thine abominations, therefore I will also destroy [thee]; neither shall my eye forgive, neither will I have mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.12'>A third part of thee shall die of pestilence, and shall be consumed with famine in the midst of thee, and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee, and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.13'>Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to cease in them, and I will be comforted; and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken [it] in my zeal when I have accomplished my fury in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.14'>And I will make thee a desert and a reproach among the Gentiles that [are] round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.15'>And thou shalt be a reproach and a dishonour, and a chastisement and a terror unto the Gentiles that [are] round about thee when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I, the LORD, have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.16'>When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for [their] destruction [and] which I will send to destroy you, then I will increase the famine upon you and will destroy your sustenance of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.17'>So I will send upon you famine and evil beasts that will destroy thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I, the LORD, have spoken.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.1'>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.2'>Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.3'>and thou shalt say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD. Thus hath the Lord GOD said to the mountains and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys: Behold, I, [even] I, bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.4'>And your altars shall be desolate, and your images of the sun shall be destroyed, and I will cause your dead to fall before your idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.5'>And I will lay the dead carcasses of the sons of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.6'>In all your provinces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate that your altars may be laid waste and condemned, and your idols shall be destroyed and shall cease, and your images of the sun shall be cut down, and your works shall be abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.7'>And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.8'>Yet I will leave a remnant that ye may have [some] that shall escape the sword among the Gentiles when ye shall be scattered through the countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.9'>And those that escape of you shall remember me among the Gentiles where they shall be carried captives because I am broken because of your whorish heart, which has departed from me and because of your eyes, which went a whoring after your idols: and they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.10'>And they shall know that I [am] the LORD [and that] I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.11'>Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Smite with thine hand and stamp with thy foot and say, Alas for all the abominations of the evils of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.12'>He that is far off shall die of the pestilence, and he that is near shall fall by the sword, and he that remains and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury in them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.3'>And that likeness put forth his hand and took me by the locks of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the heaven and the earth and brought me in [the] visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north where the habitation of the image of jealousy [was], which provokes to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.4'>And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel [was] there like the vision that I saw in the plain.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.6'>He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? [even] the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here to cause me to go far away from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, [and] thou shalt see greater abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.7'>And he brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.8'>Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall; and when I had dug in the wall, behold a door.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.7'>And he said unto them, Defile the house and fill the courts with the slain; go forth. And they went forth and slew in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.8'>And it came to pass, after they had slain them, I was left, and I fell upon my face and cried out and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the remnant of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.9'>Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah [is] exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness, for they have said, The LORD has forsaken the earth, and the LORD does not see.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.1'>The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.2'>Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.3'>And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth; there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.4'>And the names of them [were] Aholah the elder and Aholibah her sister; they were mine, and they bore sons and daughters. Thus [were] their names: Samaria [is] Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.5'>And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she fell in love with her lovers, the Assyrians [her] neighbours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.6'>[which were] clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.7'>Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all those [that were] the chosen men of Assyria, and with all whom she fell in love; with all their idols she defiled herself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.8'>Neither did she leave her whoredoms of Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity and poured their whoredom upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.9'>Therefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, of whom she fell in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.10'>These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women, for they had executed judgments upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.11'>And when her sister Aholibah saw [this], she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in [her] whoredoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.12'>She fell in love with the Assyrians [her] neighbours, captains and rulers clothed to perfection, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.14'>and [that] she increased her whoredoms, for when she saw men painted upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans painted in colour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.15'>girded with girdles upon their loins, and mitres painted upon their heads, all of them looking like princes, after the manner of the men of Babylon, born in the land of the Chaldeans,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.19'>Yet she multiplied her whoredoms in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, in which she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.27'>Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee and thy whoredom of the land of Egypt, so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.28'>For thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I deliver thee into the hand [of those] whom thou hatest, into the hand [of those] from whom thy soul is alienated:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.29'>And they shall deal with thee hatefully and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.30'>I will do these [things] unto thee because thou hast gone a whoring after the Gentiles [and] because thou art polluted with their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.31'>Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore I will put her cup into thine hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.32'>Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large; the Gentiles shall laugh thee to scorn and hold thee in derision; it contains much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.33'>Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and with pain [because] of the cup of astonishment and desolation, [because] of the cup of thy sister Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.34'>Thou shalt even drink it and finish it, and thou shalt break its shards and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken [it], said the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.35'>Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because thou hast forgotten me and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.36'>And The LORD said unto me: Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah and declare unto them their abominations?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.37'>For they have committed adultery, and blood [is] on their hands, and with their idols they have committed adultery and have even caused their sons, whom they bore unto me, to pass for them through [the fire], to devour [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.38'>Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day and have profaned my sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.39'>For when they had slain their sons unto their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, behold, thus have they done in the midst of my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.40'>And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger [was] sent; and, behold, they came for the love of whom thou didst wash thyself, paint thy eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.41'>and sit upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, upon which thou hast set my incense and my oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.42'>And in her was heard a voice of a multitude at a feast; and with the men [of renown] were brought the Sabeans from the wilderness to multiply the men, and they put bracelets upon their hands and crowns of glory upon their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.43'>Then said I unto [her that was] old in adulteries, Now shalt thy whoredoms come to an end, and she [with them];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.44'>for they have come to her, as those who come to a woman that plays the harlot, so they went in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.45'>Therefore righteous men shall judge them by the law of adulteresses and after the law of women that shed blood because they [are] adulteresses, and blood [is] on their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.46'>For thus hath the Lord GOD said: I will bring up a company upon them and will give them to be removed and spoiled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.35.2'>Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.35.3'>and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, O mount Seir, I [am] against thee, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will make thee waste and solitary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.35.4'>I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.35.5'>Because thou hast had perpetual enmities and hast scattered the sons of Israel to the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the extremely evil time:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.35.6'>therefore, [as] I live, said the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: and if thou dost not hate blood, blood shall pursue thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.35.7'>And I will make mount Seir waste and solitary and cut off from him, he that passes out and him that returns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.35.8'>And I will fill his mountains with his dead; and in thy hills and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, they shall fall that are slain with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.35.9'>I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall never be restored; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.35.10'>Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess them, whereas the LORD was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.35.11'>Therefore, [as] I live, said the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy enmity against them; and I shall be known in them when I judge thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.35.12'>And thou shalt know that I, the LORD, have heard all thy injuries which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate; they are given us to devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.35.13'>Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me and have multiplied your words against me; I have heard [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.35.14'>Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Thus shall the whole earth rejoice [when] I shall make thee desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.35.15'>As thou didst rejoice upon the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee; thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, [even] all of it: and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.1'>Also, thou son of man, prophesy upon the mountains of Israel and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.2'>Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because the enemy hath said regarding you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.3'>therefore prophesy and say, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because they have made [you] desolate and swallowed you up on every side that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the Gentiles, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers and [are] an infamy of the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.4'>Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus hath the Lord GOD said to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys, to the ruins and the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken which became a prey and derision to the residue of the Gentiles that [are] round about,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.5'>therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Surely in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the other Gentiles and against all Idumea, who have disputed my land into their possession with the joy of all [their] heart, with despiteful desires, to cast it out for a prey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.6'>Prophesy therefore upon the land of Israel and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury because ye have borne the shame of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.7'>therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: I have lifted up my hand, Surely the Gentiles that [are] about you: they shall bear their shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.8'>But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people of Israel, for they are at hand to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.9'>For, behold, I [am] for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.10'>and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, [even] all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the ruins shall be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.11'>And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall multiply and grow; and I will cause thee to dwell as was thy desire of old and will do better [unto you] than at your beginnings; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.12'>And I will cause men to walk upon you, [even] my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and from now on thou shalt no longer bereave them [of sons].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.13'>Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because they say of you, Thou [land that] devours up men and hast bereaved thy nations of sons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.14'>therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations of sons any more, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.15'>Neither will I cause [men] to hear in thee the shame of the Gentiles any longer, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause the sons of thy inhabitants to die any longer, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.16'>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.17'>Son of man, the house of Israel which dwells in their land has defiled it with their own ways and with their works; their way was before me as the uncleanness of a menstruous woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.18'>And I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols [with which] they had polluted it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.19'>And I scattered them among the Gentiles, and they were dispersed through the countries; according to their ways and according to their doings I judged them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.20'>And when they entered unto the Gentiles, where they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These [are] the people of the LORD and are gone forth out of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.21'>And it has pained me to see my holy name profaned by the house of Israel among the Gentiles where they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.22'>Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: I do not [do this] for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the Gentiles, where ye went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.23'>And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the Gentiles, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the Gentiles shall know that I [am] the LORD, said the Lord GOD when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.24'>And I will take you from among the Gentiles and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.25'>And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be cleansed from all your filthiness, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.26'>And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.27'>And I will put my Spirit within you and cause you to walk in my commandments, and ye shall keep my rights, and do [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.28'>And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.29'>I will also keep you from all your uncleanness: and I will call to the wheat and will multiply it and lay no famine upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.30'>I will multiply likewise the fruit of the trees, and the fruit of the fields, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.31'>Then ye shall remember your own evil ways and your doings that [were] not good and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.32'>Not for your sakes do I [do this], said the Lord GOD, be it known unto you; be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.33'>Thus said the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities. I will also cause [you] to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.34'>And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.35'>who said, This desolate land used to be like the garden of Eden; and these waste and desolate and ruined cities used to be fortified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.36'>And the Gentiles that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD built the ruined [places and] planted that which was desolate; I the LORD have spoken [it], and I will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.37'>Thus hath the Lord GOD said; I will yet be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do [it] for them; I will multiply men like flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.38'>As the holy sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.1'>And the hand of the LORD was upon me and took me out in the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the midst of a field which [was] full of bones,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.2'>and caused me to pass by them round about; and, behold, [there were] very many upon the face of the field; and [they were] very dry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.3'>And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.</verse>
