For since the day in which the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as [they were] from the beginning of the creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Of course, they willingly ignore that the heavens were [created] of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water, by the word of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>by which the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but the heavens, which are now, and the earth are conserved by the same word, kept unto the fire in the day of judgment and of perdition of the ungodly men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day before the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years are as one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord is not late concerning his promise, as some count lateness, but is patient with us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements, burning, shall be dissolved, and the earth and the works that are in it shall be burned up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>[Seeing] then [that] all these things shall be dissolved, what manner [of persons] ought ye to be in [all] holy conversation and godliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>waiting for and desiring earnestly for the coming of the day of God, in which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nevertheless we, according to his promises, wait for new heavens and a new earth, in which dwells righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, beloved, seeing that ye hope for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And have as saving health the patience of our Lord, even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him has written unto you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>in almost all [his] epistles, speaking in them of these things, among which are some things [that] are hard to understand, which those that are ignorant and unstable twist, as [they do] also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ye, therefore, beloved, seeing ye know [these things] in advance, be on guard lest by the error of the wicked ye be deceived with the others and fall from your own steadfastness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But grow in grace and [in] the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. To him [be] glory both now and until the day of eternity. Amen.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
