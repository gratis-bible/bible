He that does not honour the Son does not honour the Father who has sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that hears my word and believes him that sent me has eternal life and shall not come into judgment but has passed from death unto life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour shall come, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the Father has life in himself, so has he given to the Son to have life in himself</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and has also given him power [and authority] to execute judgment because he is Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Marvel not at this, for an hour shall come when all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and those that have done good shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but those that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I can of my own self do nothing; as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father who has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There is another that bears witness of me, and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Ye sent unto John, and he bore witness unto the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I receive not testimony from man, but I say these things that ye might be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He was a burning and a shining light, and ye were willing to rejoice for one hour in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I have greater testimony than [that] of John; for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me that the Father has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the Father himself, who has sent me, has borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his appearance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And ye do not have his word abiding in you; for whom he has sent, him ye do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Search the scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are those who testify of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I [do] not receive glory from men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But I know you that ye have not the love of God in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I have come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not; if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>How can ye believe, who take glory one from another, and seek not the glory that [comes] only from God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is [one] that accuses you, [even] Moses, in whom ye trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if ye do not believe his writings, how shall ye believe my words?:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
