        <description>Translated from the Original Texts in Hebrew and Greek into Spanish by Casiodoro de Reina (1569) and compared with the revision of Cipriano de Valera (1602). Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah). It was also compared word for word with the Authorized Version (by King James) of 1611.

  <div type='book' osisID='1Cor'>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, called [to be] an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes, [our] brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to those that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called [to be] holy, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace [be] unto you and peace from God our Father and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which is given you in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that in every thing ye are enriched in him in all word and [in] all knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>with which the testimony of the Christ was confirmed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that ye lack nothing in any gift, waiting for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who shall also confirm that [ye shall remain] unimpeachable unto the end, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God [is] faithful, by whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing and [that] there be no divisions among you, but [that] ye be perfect, joined together in the same understanding and in the same perception.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it has been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by those [of the house] of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>In other words, that each one of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is the Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>lest any should say that [ye were] baptized into my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas; besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the stake of Christ should be made void.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the word of the stake is foolishness to those that perish, but unto us who are saved, it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where [is] the wise? where [is] the scribe? where [is] the philosopher of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For in the wisdom of God, since the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock and unto the Gentiles foolishness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but unto those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ [is] the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>For that which is foolish of God is wiser than men, and that which is weak of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For look upon your vocation, brothers, that ye are not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>but rather God has chosen that which is the foolishness of the world to confound the wise, and God has chosen that which is the weakness of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>and that which is vile of the world and that which is despised God has chosen, and things which are not, to bring to nought the things that are,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>that no flesh should glory in his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But of him ye are [reborn] in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>that, according as it is written, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with puffed up speech or wisdom to declare unto you the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I judged not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>And my speech and my preaching [was] not with enticing words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>that your faith should not be founded in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>For we speak perfect wisdom of God, and not the wisdom of this age nor of the princes of this age, that come to nought,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, [even] the hidden [wisdom], which God predestined before the ages unto our glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>which none of the princes of this age knew (for had they known [it], they would never have crucified the Lord of glory).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But as it is written, That which eye has not seen nor ear heard neither has entered into the heart of man [is] that which God has prepared for those that love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But God has revealed [this] unto us by his Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him? Even so no one has known the things of God, but the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that God has given us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but with doctrine of the Holy Spirit, jointly fitting spiritual things by spiritual [means].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But the natural man does not perceive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he understand [them] because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But he that is spiritual discerns all things, yet he is discerned by no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For who has known the understanding of the Lord? Who has instructed him? But we have the understanding of Christ.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And I, brothers, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, [even] as unto babes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I have fed you with milk, and not with [solid] food, for until now ye were not able [to bear it], neither yet now are ye able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>For ye are yet carnal: for whereas [there is] among you envying and strife and divisions, are ye not carnal and walk as men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For while one says, I am of Paul, and another, I [am] of Apollos, are ye not carnal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>Who then is Paul? and who [is] Apollos? but servants by whom ye believed, each one according [to that which] the Lord gave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then neither is he that plants anything, neither he that waters, but God that gives the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Now he that plants and he that waters are one although each one shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are labourers together with God; ye are God's husbandry, [ye are] God's building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds upon it. But let each one see how the building is built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For no one can lay another foundation than that laid, which is Jesus the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>Now if anyone builds upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>the work of each one shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire; the work of each one, whatever sort it is, the fire shall put it to test.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If the work of anyone abides which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If anyone's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If anyone defiles the temple of God, God shall destroy that one; for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive themself. If any one among you seems to be wise in this age, let them become a fool that they may be wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>And again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Therefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all are yours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and ye are Christ's; and Christ [is] God's.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let us reckon men as ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Moreover, it is required in stewards that each one be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by man's judgment; I do not even judge my own self.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For although I have nothing on my conscience, yet am I not hereby justified, but he that judges me is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore, judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each one have praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and [to] Apollos for your sakes, that in us ye might not learn above that which is written, lest because of one, some of you become puffed up against others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who makes thee to judge? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive [it], what dost thou glory of, as if thou hadst not received [it]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye reign as kings without us, and I wish ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death; for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We [are] fools for Christ's sake, but ye [are] prudent in Christ; we [are] weak, but ye [are] strong; ye [are] honourable, but we [are] despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are ill clad and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>and labour, working with our own hands; being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>being blasphemed, we intreat; we are made as the filth of this world [and are] the offscouring of all things unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I do not write these things to shame you, but [to] warn you, as to my beloved sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For though ye may have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet ye [shall] not [have] many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>Therefore, I beseech you that ye imitate me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>For this cause I have sent Timothy unto you, who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Now some are puffed up as though I will never come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and will know not the words of those who are puffed up, but the virtue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God [is] not in words, but in virtue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What will ye? Shall I come unto you with a rod or in charity and [in] the spirit of meekness?:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is reported commonly [that there is] fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, him that has so done this deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>let such a one be delivered unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your glorying [is] not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ, our passover, is sacrificed for us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>therefore let us celebrate the feast, not in the old leaven, neither in the leaven of malice and wickedness, but in the unleavened [bread] of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote unto you in an epistle not to associate with fornicators,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters, for then ye would need to go out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But now I have written unto you not to associate with anyone calling himself a brother if he is a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner; with such a one do not even eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For why shall I judge those that are without? do ye not judge those that are within?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>But those that are without, God shall judge. Therefore, put away from among yourselves that wicked person.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go unto judgment before the unjust, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more [the] things that pertain to this life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set as judges the most humble who are in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But brother goes to judgment against brother, and that before the unbelievers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Now therefore there is certainly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather suffer [the] wrong? why do ye not rather be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>But ye do wrong and defraud and [do] this to [your] brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Know ye not that the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And such were some of you, but [now] ye are washed, but [now] ye are sanctified, but [now] ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Foods [are] for the belly, and the belly for foods; but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>And God, who raised up the Lord, will also raise up us by his own power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make [them] the members of a harlot? In no wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>What? know ye not that he who is joined to the harlot is one body [with her]? For they shall be, saith he, two in one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee fornication. Any [other] sin that a man does is outside the body, but he that commits fornication sins against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit [who is] in you, whom ye have of God, and that ye are not your own?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>For ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning the things of which ye wrote unto me: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>Nevertheless, [to avoid] fornication, let every [man] have his own wife, and let every [woman] have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence, and likewise also the wife unto the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife does not have authority of her own body, but the husband; and likewise also the husband does not have authority of his own body, but the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not defraud one another, except [it be] with [mutual] consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come together again, that Satan not tempt you for your incontinency.</verse>
