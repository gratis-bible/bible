And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he [was] unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Esther spoke yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the evil of Haman, the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And said, If it pleases the king and if I have found grace in his sight and if the thing is right before the king and if I am good in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who [are] in all the king's provinces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? How can I endure to see the destruction of my nation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then King Ahasuerus said unto Esther, the queen, and to Mordecai, the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him upon the gallows because he extended his hand against the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Write ye also for the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king's name, and seal [it] with the king's ring; for the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's ring may not be revoked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the king's scribes were called at that time in the third month, that [is], the month Sivan, on the twenty-third [day] thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews and to the lieutenants and the captains and the princes of the provinces which [are] from India unto Ethiopia, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, unto each province according to the writing thereof, and unto each people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he wrote in King Ahasuerus' name and sealed [it] with the king's ring and sent letters by posts on horseback, [and] riders on mules, mules that were born of mares,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>that the king granted [power] to the Jews who [were] in all the cities to gather themselves together and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish any army of the people or province that would assault them, [and even their] little ones and women, and [to take] the spoil of them for a prey,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>upon the same day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, [namely], upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which [is] the month Adar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The copy of the writing which was to be given as law in each province [was] published unto all people and [said] that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves of their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>[So] the posts rode upon mules, they went out on mules, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the law was given at Shushan, the palace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with a mantel of fine linen and purple; and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Jews had light and gladness and joy and honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in each province and in each city wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a banquet and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews, for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
