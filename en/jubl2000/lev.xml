        <description>Translated from the Original Texts in Hebrew and Greek into Spanish by Casiodoro de Reina (1569) and compared with the revision of Cipriano de Valera (1602). Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah). It was also compared word for word with the Authorized Version (by King James) of 1611.

        <verse osisID='Lev.1.1'>And the LORD called unto Moses, and spoke unto him out of the tabernacle of the testimony, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.2'>Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, When any of you offers an offering unto the LORD of animals, of cattle, [even] of the cows, or of the sheep ye shall make your offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.3'>If his offering is a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish; he shall offer it of his own free will at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.4'>And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering, and he shall accept it to reconcile him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.5'>Then he shall kill the bullock before the LORD; and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall offer the blood and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is [by] the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.6'>And he shall flay the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.7'>And the sons of Aaron, the priest, shall put fire upon the altar and lay the wood in order upon the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.8'>Then the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which [shall be] upon the altar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.9'>but he shall wash its intestines and its legs in water, and the priest shall incense it all on the altar, [to be] a burnt sacrifice, an offering on fire, of a very acceptable aroma unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.10'>And if his offering is of the sheep, [namely] of the lambs or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice, he shall offer a male without blemish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.1.13'>and he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water; and the priest shall offer [it] all and incense [it] upon the altar; it [is] a burnt sacrifice, an offering on fire, of a very acceptable aroma unto the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.4.35'>And he shall take away all its fat, as the fat of the lamb of the sacrifice of peace was taken away; and the priest shall incense it upon the altar in an offering on fire unto the LORD; and thus shall the priest reconcile him from his sin that he has committed, and he shall have forgiveness.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.1'>And when a person commits sin, because they were called to testify under oath, and he [was] a witness that has seen or known of [it], if he does not declare [it], then he shall bear his iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.2'>Likewise the person who touches any unclean thing, whether [it is] a carcase of an unclean beast or a carcase of unclean animal or the carcase of an unclean serpent, even [if] it is hidden from him, he shall be unclean and guilty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.3'>Or if he touches the uncleanness of man, whatever uncleanness [it is] that a man shall be defiled with, and it is hid from him, if afterward he should know of [it], then he shall be guilty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.4'>Also the person who swears, pronouncing with [his] lips to do evil, or to do good, whatever [it is] that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it is hid from him, when he knows of [it], then he shall be guilty in one of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.5'>And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these [things], that he shall confess that he has sinned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.6'>and he shall bring [for] his guilt unto the LORD for his sin, which he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb, or a kid of the goats, for his sin; and the priest shall reconcile him from his sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.7'>And if he is not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for the guilt of his sin two turtledoves or two young pigeons unto the LORD, one for his sin and the other for a burnt offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.8'>And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer [that] which [is] for the sin first and wring off its head from its neck but shall not divide [it] asunder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.9'>and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar; it [is] sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.10'>And he shall offer the second [for] a burnt offering, according to the ordinance; and [thus] shall the priest reconcile him for his sin in which he has sinned, and he shall have forgiveness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.11'>But if he is not able to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for his sin; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put [any] frankincense thereon, for it is sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.12'>Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, [even] a memorial thereof, and incense [it] on the altar upon the [other] offerings on fire unto the LORD; it [is] sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.13'>[Thus] shall the priest reconcile him from his sin in which he has sinned in one of these things, and he shall have forgiveness; and [that which remains] shall be the priest's, as [with] a present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.14'>And the LORD spoke further unto Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.15'>When [any] person commits a trespass and sins through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD, then he shall bring for [the expiation of] his guilt unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, in thy estimation of [two] shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for his guilt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.16'>And he shall pay for the sin that he has done in the holy thing and shall add the fifth part thereto and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall reconcile him with the ram of [the expiation of] his guilt, and he shall have forgiveness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.17'>Finally, if a person commits a sin by doing any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD, without doing it knowingly, he is guilty and shall bear his iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.18'>And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, in thy estimation, for [the expiation of] his guilt, unto the priest; and the priest shall reconcile him from his error which he committed in ignorance, and he shall have forgiveness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.19'>It is for his guilt; he is certainly guilty against the LORD.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.6.1'>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.6.2'>If a person commits a sin, a trespass against the LORD, and denies unto his neighbour that which was delivered unto him to keep or left in his hand, or in a thing stolen, or has slandered his neighbour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.6.3'>or has found that which was lost and [then] denies it and swears falsely, in any of all these in which a man can sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.6.4'>then it shall be that because he has sinned and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he stole, or for the damage of the slander, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.27.8'>But if he is poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of the one that vowed shall the priest value him.</verse>
