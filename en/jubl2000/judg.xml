      <chapter osisID='Judg.1'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.1'>Now after the death of Joshua, it came to pass that the sons of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first to fight against them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.2'>And the LORD said, Judah shall go up; behold, I have delivered the land into his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.3'>And Judah said unto Simeon, his brother, Come up with me into my lot that we may fight against the Canaanite; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.4'>And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanite and the Perizzite into their hands, and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.5'>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek, and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanite and the Perizzite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.6'>But Adonibezek fled, and they pursued after him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.7'>And Adonibezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered [crumbs] under my table; as I have done, so God has recompensed me. And they put him into Jerusalem, and there he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.8'>Now the sons of Judah had fought against Jerusalem and had taken it and smitten it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.9'>And afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanite that dwelt in the mountains and in the Negev and in the plains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.10'>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron before [was] Kirjatharba), and they slew Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.11'>And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir (and the name of Debir before [was] Kirjathsepher).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.12'>And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjathsepher and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.13'>And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.14'>And it came to pass when he took her that he persuaded her to ask her father for land to cultivate. And she lighted from off [her] ass, and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.15'>And she said unto him, Give me a blessing, for thou hast given me a dry land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.16'>And the sons of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the sons of Judah into the wilderness of Judah which is towards the Negev of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.17'>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanite that inhabited Zephath and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.18'>Also Judah took Gaza with its border and Askelon with its border and Ekron with its border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.19'>And the LORD was with Judah, who drove out [the inhabitants of] the mountains, but could not drive out the inhabitants of the plains, because they had chariots of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.20'>And they gave Hebron unto Caleb as Moses had said, and he expelled from there the three sons of Anak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.21'>And the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; thus the Jebusites dwell with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.22'>And also those of the house of Joseph went up against Bethel, and the LORD [was] with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.23'>And those of the house of Joseph put spies in Bethel (Now the name of the city before [was] Luz).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.24'>And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will show thee mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.25'>And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man go and all his family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.26'>And the man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and called the name of it Luz, which [is] its name unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.27'>Neither did Manasseh drive out [the inhabitants of] Bethshean and its towns nor Taanach and its towns nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanite desired to dwell in that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.28'>And it came to pass when Israel was strong that they put the Canaanites under tribute but did not utterly drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.29'>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanite that dwelt in Gezer, but the Canaanite dwelt in Gezer among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.30'>Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron nor the inhabitants of Nahalol, but the Canaanite dwelt among them and became tributaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.31'>Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho nor the inhabitants of Zidon nor of Ahlab nor of Achzib nor of Helbah nor of Aphik nor of Rehob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.32'>to the contrary Asher dwelt among the Canaanites that inhabited the land, for they did not drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.33'>Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh nor the inhabitants of Bethanath, but he dwelt among the Canaanites that inhabited the land; nevertheless, the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.34'>And the Amorites forced the sons of Dan into the mountain, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.35'>And the Amorites desired to dwell in Mount Heres in Aijalon and in Shaalbim; yet when the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, they made them tributaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.36'>And the border of the Amorites [was] from the ascent to Akrabbim from the rock and upward.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.2'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.1'>And the angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, I brought you up out of Egypt and caused you to enter into the land which I swore unto your fathers, and I said, I will never break my covenant with you</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.2'>as long as ye make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; to the contrary, ye shall throw down their altars, but ye have not heard my voice; why have ye done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.3'>Therefore, I also said, I will not drive them out from before you, but they shall be [as thorns] in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.4'>And when the angel of the LORD spoke these words unto all the sons of Israel the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.5'>And they called the name of that place Bochim, and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.6'>For Joshua had let the people go, and the sons of Israel had each gone unto his inheritance to possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.7'>And the people had served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the LORD that he had done with Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.8'>And Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, [being] one hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.9'>And they buried him within the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres in the mount of Ephraim on the north side of the mount of Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.10'>And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers, and there arose another generation after them which did not know the LORD nor the work which he had done to Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.11'>And the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baalim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.12'>And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples that [were] round about them, and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the LORD to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.13'>And they forsook the LORD and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.14'>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.15'>Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said and as the LORD had sworn unto them; and thus they were greatly distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.16'>Nevertheless, the LORD raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.17'>And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they fornicated after other gods and bowed themselves unto them; they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers had walked hearing the commandments of the LORD; [but they] did not do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.18'>And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of that judge; for the LORD repented because of their groanings by reason of those that oppressed them and afflicted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.19'>But when the judge was dead, [then] they would return, and corrupt [themselves] more than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down unto them; they did not diminish from their own doings nor from their stubborn way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.20'>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he said, Because these people transgress my covenant which I commanded their fathers and do not hearken unto my voice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.21'>neither will I drive out any longer from before them any of these Gentiles which Joshua left when he died,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.22'>that through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD by walking therein as their fathers kept [it], or not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.23'>Therefore, the LORD left those Gentiles, without driving them out hastily; neither did he deliver them into the hand of Joshua.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.3'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.1'>Now these [are] the Gentiles which the LORD left, to prove Israel with them, [even] as many [of Israel] as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.2'>[he left them] only that the generations of the sons of Israel might know, [and] to teach them war, only [for those] that had known nothing before:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.3'>[namely], five cardinals of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites that dwelt in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.4'>These, therefore, were [left] to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.5'>And as the sons of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.6'>they took their daughters to be their wives and gave their daughters to their sons and served their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.7'>And the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and forgot the LORD their God and served the Baalim and the groves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.8'>Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia, and the sons of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.9'>And when the sons of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a saviour to the sons of Israel, who saved them, [even] Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.10'>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel and went out to war; and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand, and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.11'>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.12'>And the sons of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD strengthened Eglon, the king of Moab, against Israel because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.13'>And he gathered unto him the sons of Ammon and of Amalek and went and smote Israel and took the city of palm trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.14'>So the sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.15'>But when the sons of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a saviour, Ehud, the son of Gera, a son of Jemini, a man, who had his right hand impeded, and by him the sons of Israel sent a present unto Eglon, the king of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.16'>But Ehud had made himself a two-edged sword of a cubit length, and he girded it under his clothing upon his right thigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.17'>And he brought the present unto Eglon, king of Moab, and Eglon [was] a very fat man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.18'>And when he had offered the present, he sent away the people that had brought the present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.19'>But he, himself turned again from the graven images that [were] by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret word for thee, O king, who then said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.20'>And Ehud came unto him, and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a word from God unto thee. Then he arose out of [his] seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.21'>But Ehud put forth his left hand and took the sword from his right thigh and thrust it into Eglon's belly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.22'>in such a manner that the haft also went in after the blade, and the fat closed upon the blade so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly, and the excrement came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.23'>Then Ehud went forth through the porch and shut the doors of the parlour upon him and locked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.24'>When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that the doors of the parlour [were] locked, they said, Peradventure he covers his feet in his summer chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.25'>And having waited until they were confounded and he [had] not opened the doors of the parlour; therefore, they took a key and opened [them]; and, behold, their lord [was] fallen down dead on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.26'>But while they had waited, Ehud escaped and passed beyond the graven images and escaped unto Seirath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.27'>And as he entered in, he blew the shofar in the mountain of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.28'>Then he said unto them, Follow after me, for the LORD has delivered your enemies, the Moabites, into your hands. And they went down after him and took the fords of the Jordan towards Moab and did not let anyone pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.29'>And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all fat, and all men of war, and there escaped not a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.30'>So Moab was subjected that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.31'>And after him was Shamgar, the son of Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad, and he also saved Israel.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.4'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.1'>But the sons of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD when Ehud was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.2'>And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin, king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor, the captain of whose host [was] Sisera, and he dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.3'>And the sons of Israel cried unto the LORD, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and he had mightily oppressed the sons of Israel for twenty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.4'>And a woman judged Israel at that time, Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.5'>This Deborah dwelt under a palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in Mount Ephraim, and the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.6'>And she sent and called Barak, the son of Abinoam, out of Kedesh of Naphtali and said unto him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded thee, [saying], Go and draw toward Mount Tabor and take with thee ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.7'>And I will draw Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, unto thee to the river Kishon, with his chariots and his multitude, and I will deliver him into thy hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.8'>And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go; but if thou wilt not go with me, [then] I will not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.9'>And [she] said, I will surely go with thee, but thy honour shall not be in the way that thou goest; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.10'>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and he went up with ten thousand men on foot, and Deborah went up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.11'>Now Heber, the Kenite, of the sons of Hobab, the father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which [is] by Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.12'>And the news came unto Sisera that Barak, the son of Abinoam, was gone up to Mount Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.13'>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, [even] nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that [were] with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.14'>Then Deborah said unto Barak, Rise up, for this [is] the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into thy hands. Is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor and ten thousand men after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.15'>And the LORD broke Sisera and all [his] chariots and all [his] host with the edge of the sword before Barak so that Sisera lighted down off [his] chariot and fled away on foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.16'>But Barak pursued after the chariots and after the host unto Harosheth of the Gentiles, and all the camp of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword, [and] there was not a man left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.17'>And Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for [there was] peace between Jabin, the king of Hazor, and the house of Heber the Kenite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.18'>And Jael went out to meet Sisera and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a thick coverlet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.19'>And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk and gave him to drink and covered him again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.20'>Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and if anyone should come and enquire of thee and say, Is there anyone here? Thou shalt say, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.21'>Then Jael, Heber's wife, took the tent stake, and putting a hammer in her hand, went softly unto him and smote the stake into his temples and fastened it into the ground, for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.22'>And as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he entered into where she was, behold, Sisera lay dead with the stake through his temples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.23'>So God subjected on that day Jabin, the king of Canaan, before the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.24'>And the hand of the sons of Israel began to prosper and to prevail against Jabin, the king of Canaan until they had destroyed him.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.5.1'>Then sang Deborah with Barak, the son of Abinoam, on that day, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.2'>Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.3'>Hear, O ye kings. Give ear, O ye princes; I, [even] I, will sing unto the LORD; I will praise the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.4'>LORD, when thou didst go out of Seir, when thou didst march out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped; the clouds also dropped water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.5'>The mountains melted from before the LORD, [even] that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.6'>In the days of Shamgar, the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways ceased, and those that walked went [astray] through crooked paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.7'>[The inhabitants of] the villages ceased; they had ceased in Israel until I Deborah arose, I arose a mother in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.8'>When they chose new gods, the war [was] at the gates. Was there a shield or spear to be seen among forty thousand in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.9'>My heart [is] toward the princes of Israel, those that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.10'>Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that preside in judgment, and walk by the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.11'>Because of the noise of archers, [taken from] among those that draw water, there they shall retell the righteousnesses of the LORD, [even] the righteousnesses of his villages in Israel. Now shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.12'>Rise up, rise up, Deborah; rise up, rise up, sing a song. Stand up, Barak and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.13'>Now he has made the remnant of the people to have dominion over the magnificent; the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.14'>Out of Ephraim came his root against Amalek; after thee, [came] Benjamin, against thy peoples; out of Machir came down princes; and from Zebulun, those that handle the pen of the writer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.15'>Also princes of Issachar [were] with Deborah; and Issachar, like Barak, went on foot into the valley. From the divisions of Reuben, great are the thoughts of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.16'>Why didst thou abide among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? From the divisions of Reuben great are the searchings of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.17'>Gilead remained on the other side of the Jordan, and why did Dan remain next to the ships? Asher continued on the sea shore and remained in his breaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.18'>Zebulun and Naphtali [were] a people [that] jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.19'>The kings came [and] fought; then the kings of Canaan fought in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.20'>They fought from the heavens; the stars from their ways fought against Sisera.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.21'>The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. Tred down, O my soul, with strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.22'>Then were the hoofs of the horses broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.23'>Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof because they did not come to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.24'>Blessed above women shall Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, be; blessed shall she be above women in the tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.25'>He asked water, [and] she gave [him] milk; she brought forth cream in a lordly dish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.26'>She put her hand to the stake, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer, and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.27'>At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down; at her feet he bowed, he fell; where he bowed, there he fell down dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.28'>The mother of Sisera looked out the window and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot [so] long in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots tarry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.29'>Her wise princesses answered her; and she even answered to herself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.30'>Have they not found spoil and are dividing it? To each man a damsel [or] two; to Sisera a spoil of different colours, a spoil of different colours of needlework, of different colours of needlework on both sides, [meet] for the necks of [those that take] the spoil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.31'>So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD, but [let] those that love thee [be] as the sun when he rises in all his might. And the land had rest forty years.:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.6'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.1'>And the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD delivered them into the hands of Midian for seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.2'>And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel, [and] because of the Midianites the sons of Israel made dens in the mountains and caves and strongholds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.3'>For when those of Israel had sown, the Midianites would come up and the Amalekites and the sons of the east. They would come up against them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.4'>and encamp against them and destroy the fruits of the earth as far as Gaza, and they would leave nothing to eat in Israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.5'>For they would come up with their livestock and their tents in a great multitude like locusts, for there [was] no number in them nor in their camels, and they would enter into the land destroying it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.6'>And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites, and the sons of Israel cried unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.7'>And when the sons of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.8'>the LORD sent a prophet unto the sons of Israel who said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.9'>I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drove them out from before you and gave you their land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.10'>and I said unto you, I [am] the LORD your God; do not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell, but ye have not heard my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.11'>And the angel of the LORD came and sat under the oak which [was] in Ophrah that [pertained] unto Joash, the Abiezrite, and his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, to hide [it] from the Midianites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.12'>And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him and said unto him, The LORD [is] with thee, thou mighty man of valour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.13'>And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this befallen us? And where [are] all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? But now the LORD has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.14'>And the LORD looked upon him and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites. Do I not send thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.15'>Then he replied unto him, Oh my Lord, with what shall I save Israel? Behold, my family [is] poor in Manasseh, and I [am] the least in my father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.16'>And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.17'>And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that thou hast spoken with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.18'>Do not depart from here, I pray thee, until I come unto thee and bring forth my present and set [it] before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.19'>And Gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour; the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot and brought [it] out unto him under the oak and presented [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.20'>And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay [them] upon this rock and pour out the broth. And he did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.21'>Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that [was] in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.22'>And when Gideon perceived that he [was] the angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.23'>And the LORD said unto him, Peace [be] unto thee; do not fear, thou shalt not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.24'>Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD and called it The LORD is the Peace, unto this day it [is] yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.25'>And it came to pass the same night that the LORD said unto him, Take a bullock of thy father's [house] and a second bullock seven years old and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father has and cut down the grove that [is] by it</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.26'>and build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, according to [due] order, and take the second bullock and offer a burnt sacrifice upon the wood of the grove which thou shall have cut down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.27'>Then Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had said unto him. But he feared to do it by day because of his father's family and the men of the city, so he did [it] by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.28'>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that [was] by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar [that was] built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.29'>And they said one to another, Who has done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon, the son of Joash, has done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.30'>Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son that he may die because he has cast down the altar of Baal and because he has cut down the grove that [was] by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.31'>And Joash replied unto all that stood against him, Will ye contend for Baal? Will ye save him? Whoever will contend for him, let him be put to death while [it is yet] morning; if he [is] God, let him contend for himself with the one who has cast down his altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.32'>Therefore, on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him because he has thrown down his altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.33'>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the sons of the east gathered themselves together as one and went over and pitched camp in the valley of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.34'>And the Spirit of the LORD clothed himself in Gideon, who when he had blown the shofar, Abiezer joined with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.35'>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh who also joined with him; [likewise] he sent messengers unto Asher and unto Zebulun and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.36'>And Gideon said unto God, Wilt thou save Israel by my hand as thou hast said?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.37'>Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the threshing floor; [and] if the dew is on the fleece only and [it is] dry upon all the earth [beside it], then I shall know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand as thou hast said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.38'>And it was so, for he rose up early in the morning, and wringing the fleece, he took the dew out of it, a bowl full of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.39'>But Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me if I speak again on this occasion; only let me prove again now with the fleece. I pray thee, let it be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.40'>And God did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.7'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.1'>Then Jerubbaal, who [is] Gideon, and all the people that [were] with him rose up early and pitched camp beside the well of Harod so that the camp of the Midianites was on the north, on the other side of the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.2'>And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that [are] with thee [are] too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand has saved me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.3'>Now, therefore, cause it to be proclaimed in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever [is] fearful and trembling, let him return and depart early from Mount Gilead. And twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.4'>And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people [are] yet [too] many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there; and it shall be [that] of whom I say unto thee, This [one] shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whoever I say unto thee, This [one] shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.5'>So he brought the people down unto the water, and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that laps of the water with his tongue as a dog laps, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that bows down upon his knees to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.6'>And the number of those that lapped, [putting] their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.7'>Then the LORD said unto Gideon, With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let all the [other] people go each one to his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.8'>And having taken provision for the people in his hands with their shofarot; he sent all [the other] Israelites each one to his tent and retained those three hundred men, and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.9'>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise and descend to the camp, for I have delivered it in thy hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.10'>But if thou art afraid to go down, go with Phurah thy servant down to the camp,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.11'>and thou shalt hear what they say; and then thy hands shall be strengthened, and thou shalt go down to the camp. Then he went down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that [were] in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.12'>And Midian and Amalek and all the sons of the east lay along in the valley like locusts in multitude, and their camels [were] not numbered as the sand by the sea side for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.13'>And when Gideon arrived, behold, a man was telling a dream to his fellow, saying, Behold, I dreamed a dream that I saw a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian and come unto the tents, and it smote them so that they fell and overturned them, and the tents fell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.14'>And his fellow answered and said, This [is] nothing else but the sword of Gideon, the son of Joash, a man of Israel, [for] God has delivered the Midianites with all the camp into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.15'>And when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshipped; and when he had returned into the camp of Israel, he said, Arise, for the LORD has delivered the camp of Midian into your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.16'>And dividing the three hundred men [into] three companies, he put a shofar in each man's hand with empty pitchers and torches burning within the pitchers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.17'>And he said unto them, Look at me and do as I do; and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, as I do, so shall ye do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.18'>I shall blow the shofar, I and all that [are] with me, then ye shall blow the shofarot on every side of all the camp, and say, I AM The Hewer!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.19'>So Gideon and the hundred men that [were] with him came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch [when] only the guards [were] awake, and they blew the shofarot and broke the pitchers that [were] in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.20'>And the three companies blew the shofarot; and breaking the pitchers, they held the torches in their left hands and the shofarot in their right hands to blow [with]; and they cried, The sword of I AM The Hewer!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.21'>And they stood in their places round about the camp; and all the camp was routed, and they fled crying out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.22'>But the three hundred blew the shofarot, and the LORD set each man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the camp; and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath [and] to the border of Abelmeholah unto Tabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.23'>And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali and out of Asher and out of all Manasseh and pursued after the Midianites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.24'>Gideon also sent messengers throughout all Mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and the Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together and took the waters unto Bethbarah and the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.25'>And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb; and [after they] pursued Midian, they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.8'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.1'>And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus that thou didst not call us when thou didst go to fight against Midian? And they chided with him sharply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.2'>And he replied unto them, What have I done now in comparison with you? [Is] not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.3'>God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their anger was abated toward him when he spoke that word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.4'>And Gideon came to pass the Jordan, he and the three hundred men that [were] with him, faint from the pursuit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.5'>And he said unto those of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they [are] faint [that I may] pursue after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.6'>And the principals of Succoth said, [Are] the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand that we should give bread unto thy army?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.7'>And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns and the briers of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.8'>And he went up from there to Penuel and spoke unto them likewise; and those of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.9'>And he spoke also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.10'>Now Zebah and Zalmunna [were] in Karkor and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand [men], all that were left of all the hosts of the sons of the east, for one hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword [had been] slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.11'>And Gideon went up by the way of those that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah and smote the camp, for the camp was secure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.12'>And as Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna and terrified all the host.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.13'>And Gideon, the son of Joash, returned from the battle before the sun [was up]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.14'>and caught a young man of the men of Succoth and enquired of him; and he described unto him the principals of Succoth and the elders thereof, seventy-seven men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.15'>And he came unto the men of Succoth and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, [Are] the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread unto thy men [that are] weary?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.16'>And he took the elders of the city and thorns and briars of the wilderness, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.17'>Likewise he beat down the tower of Penuel and slew the men of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.18'>Then he said unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men [were those] whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou [art], so [were] they; each one resembled the sons of a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.19'>And he said, They [were] my brethren, the sons of my mother; [as] the LORD lives, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.20'>And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Rise up [and] slay them. But the youth did not draw his sword, for he feared because he [was] yet a youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.21'>Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou and fall upon us, for as the man [is], [so is] his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna and took away the ornaments that [were] on their camels' necks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.22'>Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou and thy son and thy son's son also, for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.23'>But Gideon replied, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.24'>And Gideon said unto them, I desire to make a request of you that ye each one would give me the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings because they [were] Ishmaelites.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.25'>And they answered, We will willingly give [them]. And they spread a garment, and each one cast therein the earrings of his prey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.26'>And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand seven hundred [shekels] of gold, without the ornaments and collars and purple clothing that [was] on the kings of Midian and without the chains that [were] about their camels' necks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.27'>And Gideon made an ephod of them and kept it in his city of Ophrah, and all Israel fornicated after it in that place, and it became a snare unto Gideon and to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.28'>Thus Midian was broken before the sons of Israel so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the land rested forty years in the days of Gideon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.29'>And Jerubbaal, the son of Joash, went and dwelt in his own house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.21.22'>And when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, we will say unto them, Be merciful unto us for their sakes because in the war we did not take enough women for all [of them]; and you could not have given them to them, [or] ye should be guilty now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.23'>And the sons of Benjamin did so and took [themselves] wives, according to their number, rapturing them from among those that danced; and they went and returned unto their inheritance and rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.24'>Then the sons of Israel departed from there at that time, each man to his tribe and to his family, each one going from there to his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.25'>In those days [there was] no king in Israel; each one did [that which seemed] right in his own eyes.:</verse>
