  <div type='book' osisID='2Sam'>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.1'>Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.2'>it came to pass on the third day that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent and earth upon his head, and [so] it was when he came to David, that he fell to the earth and did obeisance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.3'>And David said unto him, Where dost thou come from? And he said unto him, I am escaped out of the camp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.4'>And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people fled from the battle, and many of the people fell and are dead, and Saul and Jonathan, his son, are dead also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.5'>And David said unto the young man that told him, How dost thou know that Saul and Jonathan, his son, are dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.6'>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear, and the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.7'>And when he looked behind him, he saw me and called unto me. And I answered, Here [am] I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.8'>And he said unto me, Who [art] thou? And I answered him, I [am] an Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.9'>He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me and slay me, for anguish is come upon me, and all my soul [is] yet in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.10'>So I stood upon him and slew him because I was sure that he could not live after he was fallen, and I took the crown that [was] upon his head and the bracelet that [was] on his arm and have brought them here unto my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.11'>Then David took hold on his clothes and rent them and likewise all the men that [were] with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.12'>And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel because they had fallen by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.13'>And David said unto the young man that told him, From where [art] thou? And he answered, I [am] the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.14'>And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.15'>Then David called one of the young men and said, Go near [and] fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.16'>And David said unto him, Thy blood [be] upon thy head, for thy mouth has testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.17'>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.18'>(He also bade them teach the sons of Judah [the use of] the bow. Behold, [it is] written in the book of righteousness.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.19'>The glory of Israel is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.20'>Tell [it] not in Gath, publish [it] not in the streets of Askelon lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.21'>Ye mountains of Gilboa, [let there be] no dew, neither [let there be] rain, upon you nor fields of offerings, for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, [as though he had] not [been] anointed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.22'>Without the blood of the slain, without the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan never turned back, and the sword of Saul never returned empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.23'>Saul and Jonathan [were] loved and desired in their lives, and in their death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.24'>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with [other] delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.25'>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, [thou wast] slain in thine high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.26'>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant hast thou been unto me; thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.27'>How are the valiant fallen, and the weapons of war perished!:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.1'>And it came to pass after this that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Where shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.2'>So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, who [had been] the wife of Nabal of Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.3'>And David brought up his men that were with him, each one with his household, and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.4'>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, The men of Jabeshgilead buried Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.5'>And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead and said unto them, Blessed [shall ye be] of the LORD that ye have showed this mercy unto your lord, [even] unto Saul and have buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.6'>And now the LORD show mercy and truth unto you; and I also will requite you this kindness because ye have done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.7'>Therefore, now let your hands be strengthened and be ye valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.8'>But Abner, the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.9'>and made him king over Gilead and over the Ashuri and over Jezreel and over Ephraim and over Benjamin and over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.10'>Ishbosheth, Saul's son, [was] forty years old when he began to reign over Israel and reigned two years. Only the house of Judah followed David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.11'>And the number of days that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.12'>And Abner, the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.13'>And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon, and when they met, the one [group] was on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.14'>And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise and sport before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.15'>Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, who [pertained] to Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.16'>And each one caught his fellow by the head and [thrust] his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together; therefore, that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which [is] in Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.17'>And there was a very severe battle that day where Abner and the men of Israel were overcome before the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.18'>And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel, and Asahel [was as] light of foot as a wild roe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.19'>And Asahel pursued after Abner, and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.20'>Then Abner looked behind him and said, [Art] thou Asahel? And he answered, Yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.21'>Then Abner said to him, Turn aside to thy right hand or to thy left and lay hold on one of the young men and take his spoil. But Asahel would not turn aside from following after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.22'>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn aside from following me; why should I smite thee to the ground? How then should I hold up my face to Joab, thy brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.23'>Howbeit he refused to turn aside; therefore, Abner with the butt end of the spear smote him under the fifth [rib] that the spear came out behind him, and he fell down there and died in the same place. And it came to pass [that] as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.24'>But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner, and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah that [lies] before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.25'>And the sons of Benjamin gathered themselves together in one troop with Abner and stood on the top of a hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.26'>Then Abner called to Joab and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? Dost thou not know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then before thou bid the people to return from following their brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.27'>And Joab replied, As God lives, if thou had not spoken, surely from this morning the people would have left off from following their brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.28'>So Joab blew the shofar, and all the people stood still and no longer pursued after Israel, neither did they fight any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.29'>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passing the Jordan, they went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.30'>Joab also returned from following Abner, and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.31'>But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin and of Abner's men, [so that] three hundred and sixty men died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.32'>And they took up Asahel and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which [was in] Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at [the] break of day.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.1'>Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David, but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.2'>And sons were born unto David in Hebron; and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam, the Jezreelitess;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.3'>and his second, Chileab, of Abigail who [had been] the wife of Nabal of Carmel; and the third, Absalom, the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.4'>and the fourth, Adonijah, the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah, the son of Abital;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.5'>and the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.6'>And it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.7'>And Saul had a concubine, whose name [was] Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And [Ishbosheth] said to Abner, Why hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.8'>Then Abner was very angry for the words of Ishbosheth and said, [Am] I a dog's head in regard to Judah? I have shown mercy this day unto the house of Saul, thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends and have not delivered thee into the hand of David that thou dost charge me today with iniquity concerning this woman?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.9'>Let God do to Abner and more also unless, as the LORD has sworn to David, so do I unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.10'>to translate the kingdom from the house of Saul and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah from Dan even to Beersheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.11'>And he could not answer Abner a word again because he feared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.12'>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose [is] the land? And that they should also say, Make thy covenant with me, and, behold, my hand [shall be] with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.13'>And he said, Good; I will make a covenant with thee, but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face except thou first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.14'>After this, David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying, Deliver [me] my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.15'>So Ishbosheth sent and took her from [her] husband, [even] from Phaltiel, the son of Laish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.16'>And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then Abner said unto him, Go, return. And he returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.17'>And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past [to be] king over you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.18'>now then do [it], for the LORD has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.19'>And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin, and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.20'>So Abner came to David to Hebron and twenty men with him. And David made a banquet for Abner and the men that [were] with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.21'>And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king that they may make a covenant with thee and that thou may reign over all that thy heart desires. And David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.22'>And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from [pursuing] a troop and brought in a great spoil with them. But Abner [was not] with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.23'>When Joab and all the host that [was] with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner, the son of Ner, came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.24'>Then Joab came to the king and said, What hast thou done? Behold, Abner came unto thee; why [is] it [that] thou hast let him go?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.25'>Dost thou not know that Abner, the son of Ner, came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in and to know all that thou doest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.26'>And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, who caused him to return from the well of Sirah, but David did not know [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.27'>And when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly and smote him there under the fifth [rib] that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.28'>And afterward when David heard [it], he said, I and my kingdom [are] guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner, the son of Ner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.29'>Let it rest on the head of Joab and on all his father's house and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue or that is a leper or that leans on a staff or that dies by the sword or that lacks bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.30'>So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.31'>Then David said to Joab and to all the people that [were] with him, Rend your clothes and gird yourselves with sackcloth and mourn before Abner. And King David [himself] followed the bier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.32'>And they buried Abner in Hebron, and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.33'>And the king lamented over Abner and said, Abner died the death of a fool!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.34'>Thy hands [were] not bound nor thy feet put into fetters. Thou didst fall as a man falls before wicked men. And all the people wept again over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.35'>And when all the people came to cause David to eat food while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also if I taste bread or anything else until the sun is down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.36'>And all the people understood, and it pleased them, for whatever the king did pleased all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.37'>For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner, the son of Ner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.38'>Then the king said unto his servants, Do ye not know that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.39'>And I [am] this day a tender anointed king, and these men the sons of Zeruiah [are] too hard for me; the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.1'>And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.2'>And Saul's son had two men [that were] captains of companies; the name of the one [was] Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon, a Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.3'>and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and were sojourners there until this day).</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.4'>And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son [that was] lame of [his] feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled, and it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell, and became lame. And his name [was] Mephibosheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.5'>And the sons of Rimmon, the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.6'>And they came there into the midst of the house [as though] they were wheat merchants, and they smote him under the fifth [rib]; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.7'>For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him and beheaded him and took his head and walked all night through the plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.8'>And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thy enemy, who sought thy life, and the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and of his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.9'>And David answered Rechab and Baanah, his brother, the sons of Rimmon, the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD lives, who has ransomed my soul out of all adversity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.10'>when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him and slew him in Ziklag as a reward for his tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.11'>How much more unto wicked men who have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? Shall I not, therefore, now require his blood of your hand and remove you from the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.12'>Then David commanded his young men, and they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet and hung [them] up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried [it] in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.1'>Then all the tribes of Israel came unto David in Hebron and spoke, saying, Behold, we [are] thy bone and thy flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.2'>And even yesterday and the day before yesterday, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that didst lead out and bring in Israel; and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.3'>So all the elders of Israel came to the king in Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.4'>David [was] thirty years old when he began to reign, [and] he reigned forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.5'>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.6'>Then the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, who dwelt in the land, who spoke unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in here, thinking, David cannot come in here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.7'>Nevertheless, David took the fortress of Zion; the same [is] the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.8'>And David said on that day, Who shall go up the waterspout and smite the Jebusites and the lame and the blind, [that are] hated of David's soul? Therefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.9'>So David dwelt in the fortress and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.10'>And David went on and grew great, and the LORD God of the hosts [was] with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.11'>And Hiram, king of Tyre, also sent messengers to David, and cedar trees and carpenters and masons, and they built David a house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.12'>And David understood that the LORD had confirmed him as king over Israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.13'>And David took more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem after he had come from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born unto David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.14'>And these [were] the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.15'>Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.16'>Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphalet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.17'>But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David, and David heard [of it] and went down to the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.18'>The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.19'>Then David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? Wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up, for I without a doubt will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.20'>And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there and said, The LORD has broken forth upon my enemies before me as the breach of waters. Therefore, he called the name of that place Baalperazim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.21'>And they left their images there, and David and his men burned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.22'>And the Philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.23'>And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up, [but] go around behind them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.24'>and when thou hearest thunder going through the tops of the mulberry trees, then thou shalt move, for then the LORD shall go out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.25'>And David did so as the LORD had commanded him and smote the Philistines from Geba unto Gazer.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.1'>Again, David gathered together all [the] chosen of Israel, thirty thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.2'>And David arose and went with all the people that [were] with him from Baale of Judah to bring up from there the ark of God upon which the name of the LORD of the hosts is invoked, who dwells there between the cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.3'>And they set the ark of God upon a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that [was] in Gibeah, and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab drove the new cart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.4'>And when they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which [was] at Gibeah, with the ark of God, Ahio went before the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.5'>And David and all the house of Israel danced before the LORD with all manner of [instruments made of] fir wood, even on harps and on psalteries and on timbrels and on cornets and on cymbals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.6'>And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth [his hand] to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen shook [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.7'>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for [his] effrontery, and there he died by the ark of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.8'>And David was grieved because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah, and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.9'>And David was afraid of the LORD that day and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.10'>So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David, but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom, the Gittite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.11'>And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months; and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.12'>And it was told King David, saying, The LORD has blessed the house of Obededom and all that [pertains] unto him because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.13'>And it was [so] that when those that bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.14'>And David danced before the LORD with all [his] might, and David [was] girded with a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.15'>So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and with the sound of the shofar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.16'>And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked through a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, and she despised him in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.17'>And they brought in the ark of the LORD and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it, and David offered burnt offerings and peace [offerings] before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.18'>And as soon as David had finished offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of the hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.19'>And he dealt among all the people, [even] among the whole multitude of Israel, to the men as well to the women, to each one a cake of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon [of wine]. So all the people departed each one to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.20'>Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal, the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.21'>Then David said unto Michal, [It was] before the LORD, who chose me over thy father and over all his house to appoint me prince over the people of the LORD, over Israel; therefore, I will dance before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.22'>And I will yet be more vile than thus and will be base in my own sight and before the maidservants whom thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.23'>Therefore, Michal, the daughter of Saul, had no children unto the day of her death.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.1'>And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.2'>that the king said unto Nathan, the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.3'>And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that [is] in thy heart, for the LORD [is] with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.4'>And it came to pass that night that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.5'>Go and tell my servant David, Thus hath the LORD said, Shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.6'>For I have not dwelt in [any] house since the time that I brought up the sons of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in [a] tent and in [a] tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.7'>In all [the places] in which I have walked with all the sons of Israel did I speak a word in any of the tribes of Israel, unto whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why did ye not build me a house of cedar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.8'>Now, therefore, so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people, over Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.9'>and I have been with thee wherever thou didst walk and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great [men] that [are] in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.10'>Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, that they may dwell in their place and never again be removed; neither shall the sons of iniquity afflict them any more as before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.11'>since the time that I commanded judges [to be] over my people Israel. And I will cause thee to rest from all thy enemies. Likewise, the LORD makes thee to know that he will make thee a house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.12'>And when thy days are fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.13'>He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.14'>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the sons of men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.15'>but my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took [it] from Saul, whom I took away from before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.16'>And thy house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee; thy throne shall be established for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.17'>According to all these words and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.18'>Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he said, O Lord GOD, Who am I and what [is] my house that thou hast brought me thus far?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.19'>And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come and that this shall be the condition of a man, O Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.20'>And what more can David say unto thee? For thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.21'>For thou hast done all these great things by thy word and according to thine own heart to make thy servant know [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.22'>Therefore, thou art great, O LORD God, for [there is] none like thee, neither [is there any] God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.23'>And who in the earth is like thy people, like Israel? A Gentile for [the love of] whom God went to ransom as a people to himself and to give him a name and to do with you great and terrible things in thy land because of thy people whom thou didst redeem unto thee from Egypt, [from] the Gentiles and their gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.24'>For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel [to be] thy people for ever, and thou, LORD, have become their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.25'>And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house, raise [it] up for ever and do as thou hast said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.26'>For [thus] shall thy name be magnified for ever that it [may] be said, The LORD of the hosts [is] God over Israel and that the house of thy servant David be established before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.27'>For thou, O LORD of the hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house. Therefore, thy servant has found it in his heart to pray this prayer in thy presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.28'>And now, O Lord GOD, thou [art] God, and thy words shall be firm, and thou hast spoken this goodness unto thy servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.29'>Therefore, now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may continue for ever before thee, for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken [it], and with thy blessing the house of thy servant shall be blessed for ever.:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.1'>And after this it, came to pass that David smote the Philistines and subdued them, and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.2'>He also smote those of Moab and measured them with a line, causing them to lie down on the ground, and he measured them with two lines, [with one] to put to death and the [other] full line to keep alive. And [so] the Moabites became David's servants, bringing presents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.3'>David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to extend his border to the river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.4'>And David took from him a thousand seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen, and David hamstrung all the chariot [horses] but reserved of them [for] one hundred chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.5'>And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians twenty-two thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.6'>Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became servants to David, bringing presents. And the LORD saved David wherever he went.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.8'>Likewise from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a great quantity of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.9'>When Toi, king of Hamath, heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.10'>then Toi sent Joram, his son, unto king David, to greet him peacefully and to bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him, for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And [Joram] brought vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of brass in his hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.11'>which King David dedicated unto the LORD with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all Gentiles which he subdued</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.14'>And he put garrisons in Edom; he put garrisons throughout all Edom, and all those of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD saved David wherever he went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.15'>And David reigned over all Israel, and David executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.16'>And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, [was] over the host, and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, [was] the writer of chronicles;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.4'>And David sent messengers and took her, and she came in unto him, and he lay with her. Then she purified herself from her uncleanness, and she returned unto her house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.8'>And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and royal food was sent unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.9'>But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord and did not go down to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.10'>And when they had told David, saying, Uriah did not go down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Didst thou not come from [thy] journey? Why [then] didst thou not go down to thy house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.11'>And Uriah said unto David, The ark and Israel and Judah abide in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? [By thy] life and [by] the life of thy soul, I will not do this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.12'>And David said to Uriah, Tarry here today also, and tomorrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day and the next day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.13'>And when David had called him, he ate and drank before him, and he made him drunk; and in the evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord but did not go down to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.14'>And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab and sent [it] by the hand of Uriah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.15'>And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and retire from him, that he may be smitten and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.16'>And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that the most valiant men [were].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.17'>And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, and [some] of the people of the servants of David fell, and Uriah the Hittite died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.18'>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.19'>and charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast finished telling the matters of the war unto the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.20'>and if the king begins to be angry and he should say unto thee, Why did you approach so near unto the city when ye fought? Did ye not know that which they can throw down from the wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.21'>Who smote Abimelech, the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? Why did you go near the wall? Then thou shalt say, Thy servant Uriah, the Hittite, is dead also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.22'>So the messenger went and came and told David all that Joab had sent him for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.23'>And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us and came out unto us into the field, and we made them retreat unto the entering of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.24'>And the archers shot from off the wall upon thy servants, and [some] of the king's servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah, the Hittite, is dead also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.25'>Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devours one as well as another; strengthen the battle against the city until it is overthrown and encourage thou him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.26'>And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah, her husband, was dead, she mourned for her husband.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.1'>And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich and the other poor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.3'>but the poor [man] had nothing except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up, and it grew up together with him and with his children; it ate of his own food and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.4'>And a traveller came unto the rich man, who did not wish to take of his own sheep and of his own cows to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the man that had come to him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.5'>And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed and pretend to be sick; and when thy father comes to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come and give me food and make the food in my sight that I may see [it] and eat [it] at her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.6'>So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick, and when the king cane to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar, my sister, come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that I may eat at her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.7'>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house and make him something to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.8'>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, and he was lying down. And she took flour and kneaded [it] and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.30'>Therefore, he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.31'>Then Joab arose and came to Absalom unto [his] house and said unto him, Why have thy servants set my field on fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.32'>And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I have sent for thee, saying, Come here, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Why have I come from Geshur?

        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.33'>So Joab came to the king and told him. Then he called Absalom, who came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.9'>Behold, he is hid now in some pit or in some [other] place, and if some of thy [men] are overthrown at the beginning, whoever hears of it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.11'>Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that [is] by the sea for multitude, and that thou go to battle in thine own person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.12'>Then we shall come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men that [are] with him, there shall not be left so much as one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.13'>Moreover, if he goes into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river until not even one small stone is found there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.14'>Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai, the Archite, [is] better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had given orders to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.15'>Then Hushai said unto Zadok and to Abiathar, the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and thus have I counseled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.3'>But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth, for if we flee away, they will not care about us; nor if half of us die, will they care about us; but now [thou art] worth ten thousand of us. Therefore, now [it is] better that thou help us out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.4'>Then the king said unto them, I will do what seems best unto you. And the king stood beside the gate, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.5'>And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, [Deal] gently for my sake with the young man, [even] with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.13'>Otherwise, I should have wrought falsehood against my own soul (for there is no matter hid from the king), and thou thyself would have set thyself against [me].</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.23'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.1'>Now these [are] the last words of David. David, the son of Jesse, said, and the man [who was] raised up high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet cantor of Israel, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.2'>(The Spirit of the LORD has spoken by me, and his word [has been] in my tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.3'>The God of Israel dictated unto me, the strong One of Israel spoke): He that rules over men [must be] just, ruling in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.4'>And as the light of the morning when the sun rises, of a morning shining forth without clouds, [as] the shining forth through light rain [upon the] tender grass of the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.5'>shall not my house be so with God, although all my saving health and my desire shall not be produced yet? For he has made an everlasting covenant with me, ordered in all [things], and it shall be kept;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.6'>but those of Belial [shall] all be as thorns to be chased away, whom no one takes with the hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.7'>but the one [that] desires to touch them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear, and they are completely burned with fire in their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.8'>These [are] the names of the mighty men whom David had: he that sat in the seat of wisdom, chief among the three: Adino, the Eznite, who on one occasion slew eight hundred enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.9'>And after him [was] Eleazar, the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, [one] of the three mighty men who [were] with David, when they defied the Philistines [that] were there gathered together to battle, and those of Israel were gone away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.10'>He arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword; and the LORD wrought a great salvation that day, and the people returned after him only to spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.11'>And after him [was] Shammah, the son of Agee, the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a community, where was an inheritance of land full of lentils, and the people had fled before the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.12'>But he stood in the midst of the inheritance and defended it and slew the Philistines, and the LORD wrought a great salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.13'>[These] three, [who were] of the thirty chief, went down and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam, and the camp of the Philistines was pitched in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.14'>And David [was] then in the fortress, and the garrison of the Philistines [was] in Bethlehem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.15'>And David longed and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which [is] by the gate!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.16'>Then [these] three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that [was] by the gate and took [it] and brought [it] to David; nevertheless, he would not drink of it, but poured it out unto the LORD, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.17'>Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this; [is not this] the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? And he would not drink it. These three mighty men did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.18'>And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred [and] slew [them] and had [a] name among the three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.19'>He was the most honourable of the three and captain among them; however, he did not attain unto the [first] three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.20'>[Then], Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, slew two lions of Moab; he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.21'>He also slew an Egyptian, a man of [great] stature, and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and slew him with his own spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.22'>These [things] did Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and had [a] name among the three mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.23'>He had more honour than the thirty, but he did not attain to the [first] three. And David put him in his council.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.24'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.1'>And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he incited David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.2'>For the king said to Joab, the captain of the host, who [was] with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel from Dan unto Beersheba and number the people that I may know the number of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.3'>And Joab replied unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people one hundredfold to however many there are and that the eyes of my lord the king may see [it], but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.4'>Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.5'>And passing the Jordan, they pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that [lies] in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.6'>After that they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtimhodshi, and they came to Danjaan and about to Zidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.7'>Then they came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites, and they went out towards the Negev from Judah, [even] to Beersheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.8'>So when they had gone through all the land, they returned to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.9'>And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king, and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword, and the men of Judah [were] five hundred thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.10'>And David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in having done this; but now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done very foolishly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.11'>And in the morning when David had risen, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.12'>Go and say unto David, Thus hath the LORD said, I offer thee three [things]: choose one of them, which I will do unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.13'>So Gad came to David and told him and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? Or wilt thou flee three months before thy enemies while they pursue thee? Or shall there be three days' pestilence in thy land? Now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.14'>Then David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait; let us fall now into the hand of the LORD, for his mercies [are] great, and let me not fall into the hand of man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.16'>And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD himself repented of that evil and said to the angel that was destroying the people, It is enough; stay now thy hand.

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.17'>And David spoke unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people and said, I have sinned, I committed the iniquity, but these sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me and against my father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.18'>And Gad came that day to David and said unto him, Go up, erect an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah, the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.19'>And David went up, according to the word of Gad, as the LORD had commanded [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.20'>And Araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him, and Araunah went out and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.21'>And Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant? And David answered, To buy this threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.22'>And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what [seems] good unto him; behold, [here are] oxen for burnt sacrifice and threshing instruments and [other] instruments of the oxen for wood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.23'>all these [things] does king Araunah give unto the King. Then Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.24'>And the king said unto Araunah, No, but I will surely buy [it] of thee at a price, for I will not offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which costs me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.25'>And David built there an altar unto the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace [offerings]. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.:</verse>
