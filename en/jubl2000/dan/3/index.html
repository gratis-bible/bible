Then they brought these men before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them, [Is it] true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that ye do not honour my gods, nor worship the statue of gold which I have set up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now, are ye ready when ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and of every musical instrument to fall down and worship the statue which I made? For if ye do not worship, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who [is] that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to king Nebuchadnezzar, We [are] not careful to answer thee in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver [us] out of thine hand, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not worship thy god, nor honour the statue which thou hast raised up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; [therefore] he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was customary to be heated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he commanded the most mighty men that [were] in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego [and] to cast [them] into the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then these men were bound in their coats, their undergarments, and their hats, and their [other] garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste [and] spoke and said unto his counsellors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered and said, Behold, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace [and] spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth and come [here]. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the great ones, the governors and the captains and the king's counsellors gathered together to see these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>[Then] Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed [be] the God of these, of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, or language which speak blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
