      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham became the father of Isaac, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>and Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez became the father of Hezron, and Hezron became the father of Aram,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>and Aram became the father of Amminadab, and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>and Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed became the father of Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse became the father of David the king.And David became the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>and Solomon became the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam became the father of Abijah, and Abijah became the father of Asa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>and Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram, and Joram became the father of Uzziah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>and Uzziah became the father of Jotham, and Jotham became the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>and Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh became the father of Amon, and Amon became the father of Josiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>and Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the deportation to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>and Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud, and Abiud became the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim became the father of Azor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>and Azor became the father of Zadok, and Zadok became the father of Achim, and Achim became the father of Eliud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>and Eliud became the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar became the father of Matthan, and Matthan became the father of Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>and Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary by whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>Therefore all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ are fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ occurred in this way. His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found ˻to be pregnant˼ by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>So Joseph her husband, being righteous and not wanting to disgrace her, intended to divorce her secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But as he was considering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what has been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she will give birth to a son, and you will call his name ‘Jesus,’ because he will save his people from their sins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this happened in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>“Behold, the virgin ˻will become pregnant˼ and will give birth to a son,and they will call his name Emmanuel,”which is translated, “God with us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>And Joseph, when he woke up from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and he took his wife</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>and ˻did not have sexual relations with˼ her until she gave birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>saying, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star at its rising and have come to worship him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>And when King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>and after calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired from them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>So they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah,are by no means least among the rulers of Judah,for from you will go out a rulerwho will shepherd my people Israel.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and determined precisely from them the time when the star appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go, inquire carefully concerning the child, and when you have found him, report to me so that I also may come and worship him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>After they listened to the king, they went out, and behold, the star which they had seen at its rising led them until it came and stood above the place where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>Now when they saw the star, they rejoiced with very great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And when they came into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. And opening their treasure boxes, they offered him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country by another route.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>Now after they had gone away, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>So he got up and took the child and his mother during the night and went away to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>And he was there until the death of Herod, in order that what was said by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled, saying,“Out of Egypt I called my son.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been deceived by the wise men, became very angry, and he sent soldiersand executed all the children in Bethlehem and in all the region around it from the age of two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined precisely from the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>“A voice was heard in Ramah,weeping and great mourning,Rachel weeping for her children,and she did not want to be comforted,because ˻they exist no longer˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>Now after Herod had died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the life of the child are dead.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>So he got up and took the child and his mother and ˻entered˼ the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream, he took refuge in the regions of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And he came and lived in a town called Nazareth, in order that what was said by the prophets would be fulfilled: “He will be called a Nazarene.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>Now in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the Judean wilderness</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is the one who was spoken about by the prophet Isaiah, saying,“The voice of one crying out in the wilderness,‘Prepare the way of the Lord,make his paths straight.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>Now John himself had his clothing made from camel’s hair and a belt made of leather around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the district around the Jordan were going out to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentence!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>And do not think to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>Already now the ax is positioned at the root of the trees; therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I baptize you with water for repentence, but the one who comes after me is more powerful than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will clean out his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John in order to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John tried to prevent him, saying, “˻I need˼ to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answered and said to him, “Permit it now, for in this way it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he permitted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>Now after he was baptized, Jesus immediately went up from the water, and behold, the heavens opened to him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And behold, there was a voice from heaven saying, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>and after he had fasted forty days and forty nights, then he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And the tempter approached and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, order that these stones become bread.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answered and said, “It is written, ‘Man will not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the highest point of the temple</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down! For it is written,‘He will command his angels concerning you,’and‘On their hands they will lift you up,lest you strike your foot against a stone.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, “On the other hand it is written, ‘You are not to put the Lord your God to the test.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and he said to him, “I will give to you all these things, if you will fall down and worship me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan, for it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and began ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now when he heard that John ˻had been arrested˼, he withdrew into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>in order that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,˻toward the sea˼, on the other side of the Jordan,Galilee of the Gentiles—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>the people who sit in darknesshave seen a great light,and the ones who sit in the land and shadow of death,a light has dawned on them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time on, Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, because the kingdom of heaven is near.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>Now as he was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew, throwing a casting net into the sea (for they were fishermen).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he said to them, “˻Follow me˼ and I will make you fishers of people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And immediately they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>And immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And he went around through all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And a report about him went out ˻throughout˼ Syria, and they brought to him all those ˻who were sick˼ with various diseases and afflicted by torments and demon-possessed and epileptics and paralytics, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And large crowds followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from the other side of the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>Now when he saw the crowds, he went up the mountain and after he sat down, his disciples approached him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>And opening his mouth he began to teach them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>“Blessed are the poor in spirit,because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed are the ones who mourn,because they will be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed are the meek,because they will inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed are the ones who hunger and thirst for righteousness,because they will be satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed are the merciful,because they will be shown mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed are the pure in heart,because they will see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed are the peacemakers,because they will be called sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Blessed are youwhen they insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things against you, lying on account of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and be glad, because your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>“You are the salt of the earth. But if salt becomes tasteless, by what will it be made salty? It is good for nothing any longer except to be thrown outside and trampled under foot by people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. A city located on top of a hill cannot be hidden,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>nor do they light a lamp and place it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it shines on all those in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>In the same way let your light shine before people, so that they can see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>“Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have not come to destroy them but to fulfill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one tiny letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all takes place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Therefore whoever abolishes one of the least of these commandments and teaches people to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever keeps them and teaches them, this person will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say to you that unless your righteousness greatly surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>“You have heard that it was said to the ˻people of old˼, ‘Do not commit murder,’ and ‘whoever commits murder will be subject to judgment.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say to you that everyone who is angry at his brother will be subject to judgment, and whoever says to his brother, ‘Stupid fool!’ will be subject to the council, and whoever says, ‘Obstinate fool!’ will be subject to fiery hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Therefore if you present your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave your gift there before the altar and first go be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>˻Settle the case quickly with your accuser˼ while you are with him on the way, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Truly I say to you, you will never come out of there until you have paid back the last penny!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>“You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>And if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it from you! For it is better for you that one of your members be destroyed than your whole body be thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it from you! For it is better for you that one of your limbs be destroyed than your whole body go into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>“And it was said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for a matter of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>“Again you have heard that it was said to the ˻people of old˼, ‘Do not swear falsely, but fulfill your oaths to the Lord.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I say to you, do not swear at all, either by heaven, because it is the throne of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>or by the earth, because it is the footstool of his feet, or by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>And do not swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your statement be ‘Yes, yes; no, no,’ and anything beyond these is from the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say to you, do not resist the evildoer, but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And the one who wants to go to court with you and take your tunic, ˻let him have˼ your outer garment also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor’ and ‘Hate your enemy.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>in order that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven, because he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not the tax collectors also do the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing that is remarkable? Do not the Gentiles also do the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>Therefore you be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.6'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>“And take care not to practice your righteousness before people to be seen by them; ˻otherwise˼ you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>Therefore whenever you practice charitable giving, do not sound a trumpet in front of you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, in order that they may be praised by people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward in full!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.36'>Then he left the crowds and came into the house, and his disciples came to him saying, “Explain the parable of the darnel in the field to us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.37'>So he answered and said, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.57'>And they were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own hometown and in his own household.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.1'>At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.3'>For Herod, after arresting John, bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.4'>because John had been saying to him, “It is not permitted for you to have her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.5'>And although he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they looked upon him as a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.6'>But when Herod’s birthday celebration took place, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst of them and pleased Herod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.7'>Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.8'>And coached by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.9'>And although the king was distressed, because of his oaths and his ˻dinner guests˼ he commanded the request to be granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.10'>And he sent ordersand had John beheaded in the prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.11'>and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.12'>And his disciples came and took away the corpse and buried it, and went and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.13'>Now when Jesus heard it, he withdrew from there in a boat to an isolated place by himself. And when the crowds heard it, they followed him by land from the towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.14'>And as he got out, he saw the large crowd and had compassion on them and healed their sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.15'>Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him saying, “The place is desolate and the hour ˻is late˼. Release the crowds so that they can go away into the villages and purchase food for themselves.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.16'>But Jesus said to them, “They do not ˻need˼ to go away. You give them something to eat.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.17'>And they said to him, “We do not have anything here except five loaves and two fish.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.18'>So he said, “Bring them here to me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.19'>And he commanded the crowds to recline for a meal on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks. And after breaking them, he gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.20'>And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.21'>Now those who ate were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.22'>And immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent away the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.23'>And after he sent away the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. So when evening came, he was there alone.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.25'>And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.26'>But the disciples, when they saw him walking on the sea, were terrified, saying, “It is a ghost!” and they cried out in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.27'>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Have courage, I am he! Do not be afraid!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.28'>And Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if ˻it is you˼, command me to come to you on the water!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.30'>But when he saw the strong wind, he was afraid. And beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.31'>And immediately Jesus extended his hand and caught him and said to him, “You of little faith! Why did you doubt?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.32'>And when they got into the boat, the wind abated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.33'>So those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.34'>And after they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.35'>And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent word into that whole surrounding region, and they brought to him all those ˻who were sick˼.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.3'>So he answered and said to them, “Why do you also break the commandment of God because of your tradition?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.4'>For God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘The one who speaks evil of father or mother ˻must certainly die˼.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.5'>But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or his mother, “Whatever ˻benefit you would have received˼ from me is a gift to God,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.6'>need not honor his father,’ and you make void the word of God for the sake of your tradition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.7'>Hypocrites! Isaiah correctly prophesied about you saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.12'>Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.13'>And he answered and said, “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.15'>But Peter answered and said to him, “Explain this parable to us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.16'>But he said, “Are you also still without understanding?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.22'>And behold, a Canaanite woman from that district came and cried out, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.23'>But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came up and asked him, saying, “Send her away, because she is crying out after us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.24'>But he answered and said, “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.26'>And he answered and said, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.27'>So she said, “Yes, Lord, for even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.28'>Then Jesus answered and said to her, “O woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you want.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.29'>And departing from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee, and he went up on the mountain and was sitting there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.30'>And large crowds came to him, having with them the lame, blind, crippled, mute, and many others, and they put them down at his feet, and he healed them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.32'>And Jesus summoned his disciples and said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with me three days already and do not have anything to eat, and I do not want to send them away hungry lest they give out on the way.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.33'>And the disciples said to him, “Where in this desolate place ˻can we get˼ so much bread that such a great crowd could be satisfied?”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.16.1'>And when the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test him, they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.16.6'>And Jesus said to them, “Watch out for and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.7'>So they were discussing this among themselves, saying, “It is because we did not take bread.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.8'>But knowing this, Jesus said, “Why are you discussing among yourselves that you do not have bread, you of little faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.9'>Do you not yet understand or do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.17.4'>So Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good that we are here! If you want, I will make here three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.5'>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.25'>And because he did not have enough to repay it, the master ordered him to be sold, and his wife and his children and everything that he had, and to be repaid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.28'>But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and taking hold of him, he began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay back everything that you owe!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.29'>Then his fellow slave threw himself to the ground and began to implore him, saying, ‘Be patient with me and I will repay you!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.30'>But he did not want to, but rather he went and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.31'>So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were extremely distressed, and went and reported to their master everything that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.32'>Then his master summoned him and said to him, ‘Wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you implored me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.33'>Should you not also have shown mercy to your fellow slave as I also showed mercy to you?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.34'>And because he was angry, his master handed him over to the merciless jailers until he would repay everything that was owed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.25'>Now there were seven brothers with us. And the first died after getting married, and because he did not have descendants, he left his wife to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.26'>So also the second and the third, up to the seventh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.27'>And last of all the woman died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.28'>In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her as wife.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.29'>But Jesus answered and said to them, “You are mistaken, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.30'>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.31'>Now concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, who said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.32'>“I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob”? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.33'>And when the crowds heard this, they were amazed at his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.34'>Now when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they assembled at the same place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.35'>And one of them, a legal expert, put a question to him to test him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.36'>“Teacher, which commandment is greatest in the law?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.37'>And he said to him, “ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.38'>This is the greatest and first commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.39'>And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.40'>On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.41'>Now while the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.42'>saying, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him, “David’s.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.43'>He said to them, “How then does David, by the Spirit, call him ‘Lord,’ saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.44'>‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right handuntil I put your enemiesunder your feet” ’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.45'>If then David calls him ‘Lord,’ how is he his son?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.46'>And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask him any more questions.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>and plotted in order that they could arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>But they were saying, “Not during the feast, so that there will not be an uproar among the people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>Now while Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>a woman came up to him holding an alabaster flask of very expensive perfumed oil, and poured it out on his head while he was reclining at table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>And when the disciples saw it they were indignant, saying, “˻Why˼ this waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>But Jesus, knowing this, said to them, “Why do you cause trouble for the woman? For she has done a good deed for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For when this woman poured this ointment on my body, she did it in order to prepare me for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then one of the twelve, the one named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>and said, “What are you willing to give me if I in turn deliver him to you?” So they set out for him thirty silver coins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And from that time on, he began seeking a favorable opportunity in order that he could betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>Now on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread the disciples came up to Jesus, saying, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>And he said, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I am celebrating the Passover with you with my disciples.” ’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>And when it was evening, he was reclining at table with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>And while they were eating he said, “Truly I say to you, that one of you will betray me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>And greatly distressed, each one began to say to him, “˻Surely I am not he, am I˼, Lord?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>And he answered and said, “The one who dips his hand in the bowl with me—this one will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of Man is going just as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if that man had not been born.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>And Judas, the one who was betraying him, answered and said, “˻Surely I am not he, am I˼, Rabbi?” He said to him, “You have said it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>Now while they were eating Jesus took bread and, after giving thanks, he broke it, and giving it to the disciples, he said, “Take, eat, this is my body.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>And after taking the cup and giving thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>But I tell you, from now on I will never drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>And after they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away because of me during this night, for it is written,‘I will strike the shepherdand the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>But Peter answered and said to him, “If they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you that during this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter said to him, “Even if it is necessary for me to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the disciples said the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be distressed and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then he said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And going forward a little he fell down on his face, praying and saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “So, were you not able to stay awake with me one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Stay awake and pray that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again for the second time he went away and prayed, saying, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will must be done.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And he came again and found them sleeping, ˻for they could not keep their eyes open˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>And leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same thing again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Get up, let us go! Behold, the one who is betraying me is approaching!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>And while he was still speaking, behold, Judas—one of the twelve—arrived, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now the one who was betraying him had given them a sign, saying, “The one whom I kiss—he is the one. Arrest him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And he came up to Jesus immediately and said, “Greetings, Rabbi,” and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>And Jesus said to him, “Friend, do that for which you have come.” Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And behold, one of those with Jesus extended his hand and drew his sword, and striking the slave of the high priest, cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place! For all who take up the sword will die by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Or do you think that I cannot call upon my Father, and he would put at my disposal at once more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it must happen in this way?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>At that time Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber, to arrest me? Every day in the temple courts I sat teaching, and you did not arrest me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this has happened in order that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then the disciples all abandoned him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>Now those who had arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Peter was following him from a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And he went inside and was sitting with the officers to see the outcome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order that they could put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>And they did not find it, although many false witnesses came forward. And finally two came forward</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it within three days.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And the high priest stood up and said to him, “Do you reply nothing? What are these people testifying against you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, “I put you under oath by the living God, that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus said to him, “You have said it. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have just now heard the blasphemy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What do you think?” And they answered and said, “˻He deserves death˼!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists, and they slapped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, “Prophesy for us, you Christ! Who is it who hit you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a female slave came up to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied it in the presence of them all, saying, “I do not know what you mean!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And when he went out to the gateway, another female slave saw him and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>And again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>And after a little while those who were standing there came up and said to Peter, “You really are one of them also, because even your accent ˻reveals who you are˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to curse and to swear with an oath, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And Peter remembered the statement Jesus had said, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times,” and he went outside and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>Now when it was early morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus in order to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>And after tying him up, they led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then when Judas, the one who had betrayed him, saw that he had been condemned, he regretted what he had doneand returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood!” But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And throwing the silver coins into the temple he departed. And he went away and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>But the chief priests took the silver coins and said, “It is not permitted to put them into the temple treasury, because it is ˻blood money˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>And after taking counsel, they purchased ˻with˼ them the Potter’s Field, for a burial place for strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>(For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood until today.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, who said, “And they took the thirty silver coins, the price of the one who had been priced, on whom a price had been set by the sons of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>and they gave them for the potter’s field, just as the Lord directed me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>So Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the king of the Jews?” And Jesus said, “You say so.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>And ˻when he was being accused˼ by the chief priests and elders he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>And he did not reply to him, not even with reference to one statement, so that the governor was very astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now at each feast, the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd—the one whom they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>And at that time they had a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>So after they had assembled, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you—Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>(For he knew that they had handed him over because of envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent a message to him, saying, “˻Have nothing to do with that righteous man˼, for I have suffered much as a result of a dream today because of him.”)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas and put Jesus to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>So the governor answered and said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate said to them, “What then should I do with Jesus, the one who is called Christ?” They all said, “Let him be crucified!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>And he said, “Why? What wrong has he done?” But they began to shout even louder, saying, “Let him be crucified!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>So Pilate, when he saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but instead an uproar was developing, took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this man. You see to it!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>And all the people answered and said, “His blood be on us and on our children!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released Barabbas for them, but after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over so that he could be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s residence and gathered the whole cohort to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>And they stripped him and put a scarlet military cloak around him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling down before him, they mocked him, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And they spat on him and took the reed and repeatedly struck him on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the military cloak and put his own clothes on him, and led him away in order to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene ˻named˼ Simon. They forced this man to carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which ˻means Place of a Skull˼),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink, and when he tasted it he did not want to drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And they sat down and were watching over him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And they put above his head the charge against him ˻in writing˼: “This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, “The one who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>In the same way also the chief priests, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>“He saved others; he is not able to save himself! He is the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusts in God; let him deliver him now if he wants to, because he said, ‘I am the Son of God’!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>And in the same way even the robbers who were crucified with him were reviling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour, darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” (that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, said, “This man is summoning Elijah!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>But the others said, “Leave him alone! let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth shook and the rocks were split.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>Now the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that took place, were extremely frightened, saying, “Truly this man was God’s Son!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>And there were many women there, observing from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>Now when it was evening, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who also was a disciple of Jesus himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a large stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>Now on the next day, which is after the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>saying, “Sir, we remember that while that deceiver was still alive he said, ‘After three days I will rise.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Therefore give orders that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him and tell the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you know how.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went with the guard of soldiers and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>Now after the Sabbath, at the dawning on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to view the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came up and rolled away the stone and sat down on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>Now his appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>And the guards trembled from the fear of him and became like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>But the angel answered and said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here, for he has been raised, just as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>And go quickly, tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead, and behold, he is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there.’ Behold, I have told you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Greetings!” And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid! Go tell my brothers that they should go to Galilee, and there they will see me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>And while they were going, behold, some of the guard of soldiers went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>And after they had assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a rather large sum of money to the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>telling them, “Say ‘His disciples came during the night and stole him while we were sleeping.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>And if this matter is heard before the governor, we will satisfy him and ˻keep you out of trouble˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>So they took the money and did as they were told, and spread abroad this report among the Jews until this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>So the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>And when they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you all the days until the end of the age.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>Just as it is written in the prophet Isaiah,“Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face,who will prepare your way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>the voice of one shouting in the wilderness,‘Prepare the way of the Lord,make straight his paths!’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John was there baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And all the Judean region and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>And John was dressed in camel’s hair and a belt made of leather around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And he was preaching, saying, “One who is more powerful than I is coming after me, of whom I am not worthy to bend down and untie the strap of his sandals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it happened that in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And immediately as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens being split apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>Now after John ˻had been taken into custody˼, Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying, “The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the gospel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And as he was passing by along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And Jesus said to them, “˻Follow˼ me and I will make you become fishers of people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And immediately they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, and they were in the boat mending the nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went away after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they went into Capernaum and immediately on the Sabbath he went into the synagogue and began to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were amazed at his teaching, because he was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And so then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>saying, “˻Leave us alone˼, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And after convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, the unclean spirit came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And they were all amazed, so that they began to discuss with one another, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And the report about him then went out everywhere in the whole surrounding region of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And so then he departed from the synagogue and came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down, suffering with a fever, and at once they told him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And he came and raised her up by taking hold of her hand, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>Now when it was evening, when the sun had set, they began bringing to him all those ˻who were sick˼ and those who were demon-possessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And the whole town was gathered together at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And he healed many ˻who were sick˼ with various diseases and expelled many demons. And he did not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And getting up early in the morning while it was very dark, he departed and went to a deserted place, and there he was praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon and those who were with him searched diligently for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>And they found him and said to him, “Everyone is looking for you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And he said to them, “Let us go elsewhere, into the neighboring rural towns, so that I can preach there also, because I have come out for this very reason.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he went into all Galilee preaching in their synagogues and expelling demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And a leper came to him, entreating him and kneeling down and saying to him, “If you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And having compassion, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, “I am willing; be made clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And immediately the leprosy went away from him and he was made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And warning him sternly, he sent him away at once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>And he said to him, “See to it that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and bring for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread abroad the account, so that he was no longer able to enter publicly into a town. But he was staying outside in deserted places, and they were coming to him from all directions.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it became known that he was at home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And many had gathered, so that there was no longer room, not even at the door, and he was speaking the word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they came bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And when they were not able to bring him to him because of the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. And after digging through, they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Child, your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>Now some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>“Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they were reasoning like this within themselves, said to them, “Why are you considering these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,”—he said to the paralytic—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>“I say to you, get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And he got up and immediately picked up his stretcher and went out in front of them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>And he went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he began to teach them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And as he was passing by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me!” And he stood up and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And it happened that he ˻was dining˼ in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners ˻were dining with˼ Jesus and his disciples, for there were many and they were following him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, began to say to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician, but those ˻who are sick˼. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>And John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and said to him, “˻Why˼ do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus said to them, “The ˻bridegroom’s attendants˼ are not able to fast while the bridegroom is with them, are they? As long a time as they have the bridegroom with them, they are not able to fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment. ˻Otherwise˼ the patch pulls away from it—the new from the old—and the tear becomes worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. ˻Otherwise˼ the wine will burst the wineskins and the wine is destroyed and the wineskins too. But new wine is put into new wineskins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>And it happened that he was going through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and his disciples began to make their way while plucking off the heads of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees began to say to him, “Behold, why are they doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he had need and he and those who were with him were hungry—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>how he entered into the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the presentation, which it is not permitted to eat (except the priests) and also gave it to those who were with him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said to them, “The Sabbath was established for people, and not people for the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>So then, the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And he entered into the synagogue again, and a man who had a withered hand was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they were watching him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, in order that they could accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come into the middle.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>And he said to them, “Is it permitted on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And looking around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>And the Pharisees went out immediately with the Herodians ˻and began to conspire˼ against him with regard to how they could destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>And Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd from Galilee followed him. And from Judea</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from Jerusalem and from Idumea and the other side of the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon a great crowd came to him because they heard all that he was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he told his disciples that a small boat should stand ready for him because of the crowd, so that they would not press upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he had healed many, so that all those who ˻were suffering from diseases˼ pressed about him in order that they could touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, were falling down before him and crying out, saying, “You are the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And he warned them strictly that they should not make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And he went up on the mountain and summoned those whom he wanted, and they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And he appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, so that they would be with him and so that he could send them out to preach</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to expel demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And he appointed the twelve. And to Simon he gave the name Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>and James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (and he gave to them the name Boanerges, that is, “Sons of Thunder”),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they were not even able to eat a meal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And when˻his family˼ heard this, they went out to restrain him, for they were saying, “He has lost his mind!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul!” and “By the ruler of the demons he expels the demons!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And he called them to himself and was speaking to them in parables, “How can Satan expel Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand, but is at an end!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>But no one is able to enter into the house of a strong manand plunder his property unless he first ties up the strong man, and then he can thoroughly plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>“Truly I say to you that all the sins and the blasphemies will be forgiven the sons of men, however much they blaspheme.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit does not have forgiveness ˻forever˼, but is guilty of an eternal sin”—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>And his mother and his brothers arrived, and standing outside, they sent word to him to summon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And a crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers and your sisters are outside looking for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And he answered them and said, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And looking around at those who were sitting around him in a circle, he said, “Behold, my mother and my brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>For whoever does the will of God, this person is my brother and sister and mother.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And again he began to teach beside the sea, and a very large crowd was gathered to him, so that he got into a boat and sat on the sea, and the whole crowd was at the sea on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he began to teach them many things in parables, and was saying to them in his teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>“Listen! Behold, the sower went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And it happened that while he was sowing, ˻some seed˼ fell on the side of the path, and the birds came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up at once, because it did not have any depth of soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>And when the sun rose it was scorched, and because it did not have enough root, it withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And other seed fell among the thorn plants, and the thorn plants came up and choked it, and it did not produce grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>And other seed fell on the good soil, and produced grain, coming up and increasing, and it bore a crop—one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he was alone, those around him together with the twelve began asking him about the parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And he said to them, “To you has been granted the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside everything is in parables,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>so that‘˻they may look closely˼ and not perceive,and ˻they may listen carefully˼ and not understand,lest they turn and it be forgiven them.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? And how will you understand all the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>And these are the ones beside the path where the word is sown, and whenever they hear it, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these are the ones sown on the rocky ground, who whenever they hear the word immediately receive it with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Then when affliction or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And others are the ones sown among the thorn plants—these are the ones who hear the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word and it becomes unproductive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And those are the ones sown on the good soil, who hear the word and receive it and bear fruit—one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he said to them, “Surely a lamp is not brought so that it may be put under a bushel basket or under a bed, is it? Is it not so that it may be put on a lampstand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For nothing is secret except so that it may be revealed, nor has become hidden except so that it will come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And he said to them, “Take care what you hear! With the measure by which you measure out, it will be measured out to you, and will be added to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For whoever has, more will be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he said, “The kingdom of God is like this: like a man scatters seed on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>And he sleeps and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows—˻he does not know how˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>By itself the soil produces a crop: first the grass, then the head of grain, then the full grain in the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the crop permits, he sends in the sickle right away, because the harvest has come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And he said, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or by what parable can we present it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a mustard seed that when sown on the ground, although it is the smallest of all the seeds that are on the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>but when it is sown it grows up and becomes the largest of all the garden herbs, and sends out large branches so that the birds of the sky are able to nest in its shade.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>And with many parables such as these he was speaking the word to them, as they were able to hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>And he did not speak to them without a parable, but in private he explained everything to his own disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>And on that day, when it was evening, he said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>And leaving the crowd, they took him along, as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And a great storm of wind developed, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already being filled with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>And he was in the stern sleeping on the cushion, and they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, is it not a concern to you that we are perishing?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And he woke up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Be quiet! Be silent!” And the wind abated and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>And he said to them, “Why are you fearful? Do you not yet have faith?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>And ˻they were terribly frightened˼ and began to say to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>And they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And as he was getting out of the boat, immediately from the tombs a man with an unclean spirit went to meet him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>who ˻lived˼ among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him any longer, not even with a chain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles had been shattered. And no one was strong enough to subdue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And during every night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was crying out and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>And when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and knelt down before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>And crying out with a loud voice he said, “˻What have I to do with you˼, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God, do not torment me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>(For he was saying to him, “Come out of the man, unclean spirit!”)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And he was asking him “˻What is your name˼?” And he said to him, “My name is Legion, because we are many.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he was imploring him many times that he would not send them out of the region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now a large herd of pigs was there at the hill feeding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>and they implored him, saying, “Send us to the pigs so that we may enter into them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>And he permitted them. And the unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs, and the herd—about two thousand—rushed headlong down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>And their herdsmen fled and reported it in the town and in the countryside, and they came to see what it was that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there clothed and in his right mind—the one who had had the legion—and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and about the pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>And they began to urge him to depart from their region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And as he was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed began to implore him that he could go with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>And he did not permit him, but said to him, “Go to your home to your people and tell them all that the Lord has done for you, and that he has had mercy on you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him, and they were all astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>And after Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered to him, and he was beside the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>And one of the rulers of the synagogue came—Jairus by name—and when he saw him, he fell down at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>And he was imploring him many times, saying, “My little daughter ˻is at the point of death˼! Come, lay your hands on her, so that she will get well and will live.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And he went with him, and a large crowd was following him and pressing around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>And there was a woman who was ˻suffering from hemorrhages˼ twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>And she had endured many things under many physicians, and had spent ˻all that she had˼ and had received no help at all, but instead ˻became worse˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>When she heard about Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind himand touched his cloak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>for she was saying, “If I touch just his clothing, I will be healed!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>And immediately her ˻hemorrhage stopped˼ and she realized in her body that she was healed of her suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from himself, turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothing?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing upon you, and you say ‘Who touched me?’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And he was looking around to see the one who had done this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>So the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>But he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be well from your suffering.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he was still speaking, they came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter has died. Why trouble the Teacher further?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But Jesus, ignoring ˻what was said˼, told the ruler of the synagogue, “Do not be afraid—only believe!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And he did not allow anyone to follow along with him except Peter and James and John, the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>And they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and saw a commotion, and people weeping and wailing loudly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And when he entered, he said to them, “Why are you agitated and weeping? The child is not dead, but is sleeping.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they began laughing at him. But he sent them all out and took along the father and mother of the child, and those who were with him, and went in to where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>And taking hold of the child’s hand, he said to her, “Talitha koum!” (which is translated, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>and immediately the girl stood up and began walking around (for she was twelve years old). And ˻immediately they were utterly and completely astonished˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>And he commanded them strictly that no one should learn of this, and said to give her something to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>And he went out from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>And when the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed, saying, “Where did this man get these things? And what is this wisdom that has been granted to this man, and the miracles such as these performed through his hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” And they were offended by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>And Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, and among his relatives, and in his own household.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>And he was not able to do any miracle in that place except to lay his hands on a few sick peopleand heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And he was astonished because of their unbelief.And he was going around among the villages teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And he summoned the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>And he commanded them that they take along nothing for the journey except only a staff—no bread, no traveler’s bag, no money in their belts—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>but to put on sandals and not to wear two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>And he said to them, “Whenever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>And whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>And they went out and proclaimed that people should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>And they were expelling many demons and anointing many sick people with olive oil and healing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>And King Herod heard it, because his name had become known. And they were saying, “John, the one who baptizes, has been raised from the dead, and because of this these miraculous powers are at work in him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>But others were saying, “He is Elijah,” and others were saying, “He is a prophet like one of the prophets.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>But when Herod heard it, he said, “John whom I beheaded—this one has been raised!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herod himself had sent and arrested John and bound him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not permitted for you to have your brother’s wife.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>So Herodias held a grudge against him and was wanting to kill him, and was not able to do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>For Herod was afraid of John, because he knew him to be a righteous and holy man and protected him. And when he listened to him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he listened to him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>And a suitable day came when Herod, on his birthday, gave a banquet for his courtiers and military tribunes and the most prominent men of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>And when his daughter Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and ˻his dinner guests˼. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you want, and I will give it to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>And he swore to her at length, “Anything whatever you ask me for I will give you, up to half my kingdom!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>And she went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” And she said, “The head of John the baptizer.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>And although he was deeply grieved, the king, because of his oaths and ˻dinner guests˼, did not want to refuse her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>And immediately the king sent an executioner and ordered him to bring his head. And he went and beheaded him in the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>And he brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>And when his disciples heard this, they came and took away his corpse and placed it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>And the apostles regathered to Jesus and reported to him everything that they had done and that they had taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>And he said to them, “You yourselves come privately to an isolated place and rest for a short time.” For those who were coming and going were many, and they did not even have time to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>And they went away in the boat to an isolated place by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>And many people saw them leaving and recognized them, and ran there together by land from all the towns, and arrived ahead of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>And getting out of the boat he saw the large crowd and had compassion on them, because they were like sheep ˻without˼ a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>And the hour had already become late when his disciples came up to him, saying, “The place is desolate and the hour is already late.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding farms and villages and purchase something to eat for themselves.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>But he answered and said to them, “You give them something to eat.” And they said to him, “Should we go and purchase bread for two hundred denarii and give it to them to eat?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>And he said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go look!” And when they found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>And he ordered them all to recline in groups on the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>And they reclined in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>And taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves and gave them to his disciples so that they could set them before them. And he distributed the two fish to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>And they all ate and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>And they picked up the broken pieces, twelve baskets full, and of the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>And immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself dismissed the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>And after he had said farewell to them, he went away to the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>And when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea and he was alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>And he saw them being beaten in their rowing because the wind was against them. Around the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and he was wanting to pass by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>But when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought that it was a ghost, and they cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>For they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke with them and said to them, “Have courage, I am he! Do not be afraid!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>And he went up with them into the boat, and the wind abated. And ˻they were extraordinarily˼ astounded within themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>because they did not understand concerning the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>And after they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>And as they were getting out of the boat, people recognized him immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>They ran about through that whole region and began to carry around those ˻who were sick˼ on stretchers, wherever they heard that he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And wherever he would go, into villages or into towns or to farms, they would put those who were sick in the marketplaces and would implore him that if they could touch even the edge of his cloak. And all those who touched it were healed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>And the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>And they saw that some of his disciples were eating their bread with unclean—that is, unwashed—hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands ˻ritually˼, thus holding fast to the traditions of the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions which they have received and hold fast to—for example, the washing of cups and pitchers and bronze kettles and dining couches.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unclean hands?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>So he said to them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written,‘This people honors me with their lips,but their heart is far, far away from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>And they worship me in vain,teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>Abandoning the commandment of God, you hold fast to the tradition of men.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>And he said to them, “You splendidly ignore the commandment of God so that you can maintain your tradition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘The one who speaks evil of father or mother ˻must certainly die˼.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>But you say, ‘If a man says to his father or to his mother, “Whatever ˻benefit you would have received˼ from me iscorban” (that is, a gift to God),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down, and you do many similar things such as this.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>And summoning the crowd again, he said to them, “Listen to me, all of you, and understand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>There is nothing outside of a person that is able to defile him by going into him. But the things that go out of a person are the things that defile a person.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>And when he entered into the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>And he said to them, “So are you also without understanding? Do you not understand that everything that is outside that goes into a person is not able to defile him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>For it does not enter into his heart but into his stomach, and goes out into the latrine”—thus declaring all foods clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>And he said, “What comes out of a person, that defiles a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>For from within, from the heart of people, come evil plans, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>adulteries, acts of greed, malicious deeds, deceit, licentiousness, ˻envy˼, abusive speech, pride, foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>All these evil things come from within and defile a person.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>And from there he set out and went to the region of Tyre. And when he entered into a house, he wanted no one to know, and yet he was not able to escape notice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>But immediately a woman whose young daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit, when she heard about him, came and fell down at his feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>Now the woman was a Greek—a Syrophoenician by nationality—and she was asking him that he would expel the demon from her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>And he said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>But she answered and said to him, “Lord, even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>And he said to her, “Because of this statement, go! The demon has gone out of your daughter.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>And when she went to her home, she found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>And again he went away from the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of the Decapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they were imploring him that he would place his hand on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>And he took him away from the crowd by himself and put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, “Ephphatha!” (that is, “Be opened!”).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>And immediately his ears were opened and ˻his difficulty in speaking was removed˼ and he began to speak normally.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>And he ordered them that they should say nothing, but as much as he ordered them not to, they proclaimed it even more instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>And they were amazed beyond all measure, saying, “He has done all things well! He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>In those days there was again a large crowd, and they did not have anything they could eat. Summoning the disciples, he said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.2'>“I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with me three days already and do not have anything to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>And if I send them away hungry to their homes they will give out on the way, and some of them have come from far away.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>And his disciples answered him, “Where is anyone able to feed these people with bread here in the desert?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>And he asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” So they said, “Seven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>And he commanded the crowd to recline for a meal on the ground, and taking the seven loaves, after he had given thanks he broke them and began giving them to his disciples so that they could set them before them. And they set them before the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>And they had a few small fish, and after giving thanks for them, he said to set these before them also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>And they ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces that were left, seven baskets full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>Now there were about four thousand. And he sent them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>And the Pharisees came and began to argue with him, demanding from him a sign from heaven in order to test him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>And sighing deeply in his spirit, he said, “Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>And they had forgotten to take bread, and except for one loaf, they did not have any with them in the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>And he ordered them, saying, “Watch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>And they began to discuss with one another that they had no bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>And knowing this, he said to them, “Why are you discussing that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Have your hearts been hardened?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>Although you have eyes, do you not see? And although you have ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.19'>When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?” They said to him, “Twelve.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.20'>“When I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?” And they said to him, “Seven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.21'>And he said to them, “Do you not yet understand?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>And they came to Bethsaida. And they brought to him a blind man and implored him that he would touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.23'>And he took hold of the blind man’s hand and led him outside the village, and after spitting in his eyes, he placed his hands on him and asked him, “Do you see anything?”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>Then he placed his hands on his eyes again, and he opened his eyes and was cured, and could see everything clearly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>And after six days, Jesus took along Peter and James and John, and led them to a high mountain by themselves alone. And he was transfigured before them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.3'>and his clothing became radiant—extremely white, like no cloth refiner on earth can ˻make so white˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>And Elijah appeared to them together with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>And Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good that we are here! And let us make three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.6'>(For he did not know what he should answer, because they were terrified.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>And a cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came from the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>And as they were coming down from the mountain, he ordered them that they should tell no one the things that they had seen, except when the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>And they kept the matter to themselves, discussing what this rising from the dead ˻meant˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>And they asked him, saying, “˻Why do˼ the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>And he said to them, “Elijah indeed does come first and restores all things. And how is it written concerning the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.15'>And immediately the whole crowd, when they saw him, were amazed, and ran up to himand greeted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>And he asked them, “What are you arguing about with them?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>And one individual from the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought to you my son who has ˻a spirit that makes him mute˼.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>And they brought him to him. And when he saw him, the spirit immediately convulsed him, and falling on the ground, he began to roll around, foaming at the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>And he asked his father how long it was since this had been happening to him. And he said, “From childhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>And often it has thrown him both into fire and into water, in order that it could destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have compassion on us and help us!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>And after he had entered into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why were we not able to expel it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>And he said to them, “This kind can come out by nothing except by prayer.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>And from there they went out and passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>for he was teaching his disciples and was telling them, “The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>But they did not understand the statement, and they were afraid to ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>And they came to Capernaum. And after he was in the house, he asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.34'>But they were silent, because they had argued with one another on the way about who was greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>And he sat down and called the twelve and said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he will be last of all and servant of all.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.27'>Jesus looked at them and said, “With human beings it is impossible, but not with God. For all thingsare possible with God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.28'>Peter began to say to him, “Behold, we have left everything and followed you.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.37'>So they said to him, “Grant to us that we may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your glory.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.38'>But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.39'>And they said to him, “We are able.” So Jesus said to them, “You will drink the cup that I drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.40'>but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but is for those for whom it has been prepared.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.41'>And when they heard this, the ten began to be indignant about James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.42'>And Jesus called them to himself and said to them, “You know that those who are considered to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their people in high positions exercise authority over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.43'>But it is not like this among you! But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.44'>and whoever wants to be most prominent among you must be the slave of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.45'>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.46'>And they came to Jericho. And as he was setting out from Jericho along with his disciples and a large crowd, a blind beggar, Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus, was sitting beside the road.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.50'>And he threw off his cloak, jumped up, and came to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.51'>And Jesus answered him and said, “What do you want ˻me to do˼ for you?” And the blind man said to him, “Rabboni, that I may regain my sight.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.5'>And he sent another, and that one they killed. And he sent many others, some of whom they beat and some of whom they killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.6'>He had one more, a beloved son. Last of all he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>And they were seeking to arrest him, and they were afraid of the crowd, because they knew that he had told the parable with reference to them. And they left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>And they sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him so that they could catch him unawares in a statement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>And when they came, they said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and ˻you do not care what anyone thinks˼, ˻because you do not regard the opinion of people˼ but teach the way of God in truth. Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or should we not pay?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>But because he knew their hypocrisy, he said to them, “Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius so that I can look at it!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.16'>So they brought one. And he said to them, “Whose image and inscription is this?” And they said to him, “Caesar’s.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>There were seven brothers, and the first took a wife. And when he died, he did not leave descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.21'>And the second took her, and he died without leaving descendants. And the third likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>And the seven did not leave descendants. Last of all the woman also died.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>Jesus said to them, “Are you not deceived because of this, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>Now concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses ˻in the passage about the bush˼ how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>And one of the scribes came up and heard them debating. When he saw that he answered them well, he asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Listen, Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>And the scribe said to him, “That is true, Teacher. You have said ˻correctly˼ that he is one and there is no other except him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>And to love him from your whole heart and from your whole understanding and from your whole strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>And Jesus, when he saw that he had answered thoughtfully, said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And no one dared to put a question to him any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>And continuing, Jesus said while teaching in the temple courts, “How can the scribes say that the Christ is David’s son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>David himself said by the Holy Spirit,‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,until I put your enemiesunder your feet.” ’</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>And in his teaching he said, “Beware of the scribes, who like walking around in long robes and greetings in the marketplaces</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.39'>and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>who devour the houses of widows and pray lengthy prayers for the sake of appearance. These will receive more severe condemnation!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>And he sat down opposite the contribution box and was observing how the crowd was putting coins into the contribution box. And many rich people were putting in many coins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>And one poor widow came and put in two small copper coins (that is, a penny).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>And summoning his disciples, he said to them, “Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all those who put offerings into the contribution box.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>For they all ˻contributed˼ out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in everything she had, her whole means of subsistence.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.5'>For this perfumed oil could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor!” And they began to scold her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>You have heard the blasphemy! What ˻do you think˼?” And they all condemned him ˻as deserving death˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him with their fists, and to say to him “Prophesy!” And the officers received him with slaps in the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>And while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the female slaves of the high priest came up</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked intently at him and said, “You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you mean!” And he went out into the gateway, and a rooster crowed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>So Pilate asked him again, saying, “Do you not answer anything? See how many charges they are bringing against you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus did not answer anything further, so that Pilate was astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now at each feast he customarily released for them one prisoner whom they requested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>And the one named Barabbas was imprisoned with the rebels who had committed murder in the rebellion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>And the crowd came up and began to ask him to do as he customarily did for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>So Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>(For he realized that the chief priests had handed him over because of envy.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests incited the crowd so that he would release for them Barabbas instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>So Pilate answered and said to them again, “Then what do you want me to do with the one whom you call the king of the Jews?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>And they shouted again, “Crucify him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>And Pilate said to them, “Why? What evil has he done?” But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>So Pilate, because he wanted ˻to satisfy˼ the crowd, released for them Barabbas. And after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over so that he could be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>So the soldiers led him away into the palace (that is, the governor’s residence) and called together the whole cohort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>And they put a purple cloak on him, and after weaving a crown of thorns they placed it on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>And they began to greet him, “Hail, king of the Jews!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>And they repeatedly struck him on the head with a reed, and were spitting on him, and ˻they knelt down˼and did obeisance to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him, and they led him out so that they could crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they forced a certain man who was passing by, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), who was coming from the country, to carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they brought him to the place Golgotha (which is translated “Place of a Skull”).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>And they attempted to give him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And they crucified him and divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots for them to see who should take what.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>Now it was the third hour when they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And the inscription of the charge against him was written, “The king of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! The one who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>save yourself by coming down from the cross!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>In the same way also the chief priests, along with the scribes, were mocking him to one another, saying, “He saved others; he is not able to save himself!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe! Even those who were crucified with him were reviling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>And when the sixth hour came, darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” (which is translated, “My God, my God, ˻why˼ have you forsaken me?”)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>And some of the bystanders, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is summoning Elijah!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Leave him alone! Let us see if Elijah is coming to take him down.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>But Jesus uttered a loud cry and expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>And the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>And when the centurion who was standing opposite him saw that he expired like this, he said, “Truly this man was God’s Son!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>And there were also women observing from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and Joses, and Salome,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>who used to follow him and serve him when he was in Galilee, and many other women who went up with him to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>And when it was already evening, since it was the day of preparation (that is, the day before the Sabbath),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the council who was also himself looking forward to the kingdom of God, came acting courageously and went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>And Pilate was surprised that he was already dead, and summoning the centurion, asked him whether he had died already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And when he learned of it from the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And after purchasing a linen cloth and taking him down, he wrapped him in the linen cloth and placed him in a tomb that had been cut from the rock. And he rolled a stone over the entrance of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was placed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>And when the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome purchased fragrant spices so that they could go and anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very early in the morning on the first day of the week they came to the tomb after the sun had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>And when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away (for it was very large).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And as they were going into the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified. He has been raised, he is not here! See the place where they laid him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>And they went out and fled from the tomb, because trembling and amazement had seized them. And they said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.〚So they promptly reported all the things they had been commanded to those around Peter. And after these things, Jesus himself also sent out through them from the east even as far as the west the holy and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation. Amen.〛〚</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Now early on the first day of the week, after he rose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had expelled seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went out and announced it to those who were with him while they were mourning and weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>And those, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, refused to believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>And after these things, he appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking, while they were going out into the countryside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>And these went and reported it to the others, and they did not believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>And later, while they were reclining at table, he appeared to the eleven. And he reprimanded their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And he said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, but the one who refuses to believe will be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will expel demons, they will speak in new tongues,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>and they will pick up snakes with their hands. And if they drink any deadly poison it will never hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick and ˻they will get˼ well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>Then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>And they went out and proclaimed everywhere, while the Lord was working together with them and confirming the message through the accompanying signs.〛</verse>

    <div type='book' osisID='Luke'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Since many have attempted to compile an account concerning the events that have been fulfilled among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>just as those who were eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning passed on to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it seemed best to me also—because I have followed all things carefully from the beginning—to write them down in orderly sequence for you, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>so that you may know the certainty concerning the things about which you were taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>It happened that in the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest, Zechariah by name, of the division of Abijah. And ˻he had a wife˼ from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous in the sight of God, living blamelessly in all the commandments and regulations of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>And ˻they did not have˼ a child, because Elizabeth was barren. And they were both advanced ˻in years˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>And it happened that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priesthood he was chosen by lot to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And the whole crowd of the people were praying outside at the hour of the incense offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And Zechariah was terrified when he saw the angel, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him,“Do not be afraid, Zechariah,because your prayer has been heard,and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son,and you will call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And ˻you will experience joy and exultation˼,and many will rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord,and he must never drink wine or beer,and he will be filled with the Holy Spiritwhile he is still in his mother’s womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And he will turn many of the sons of Israelto the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he will go on before himin the spirit and power of Elijah,to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous,to prepare for the Lord a people made ready.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zechariah said to the angel, “By what will I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced ˻in years˼!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answered and said to him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to announce to you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And behold, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day these things take place, ˻because˼ you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and began to wonder when he was delayed in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>And when he came out he was not able to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them, and remained unable to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And it happened that when the days of his service came to an end, he went away to his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>Now after these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she kept herself in seclusion for five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>“Thus the Lord has done for me in the days in which he has concerned himself with me, to take away my disgrace among people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee ˻named˼ Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin legally promised in marriage to a man ˻named˼ Joseph of the house of David. And the name of the virgin was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>But she was greatly perplexed at the statement, and was pondering what sort of greeting this might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said to her,“Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And behold, you will conceive in the womb and will give birth to a son,and you will call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>This one will be great, and he will be called the Son of the Most High,and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And he will reign over the house of Jacob ˻forever˼,and of his kingdom there will be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I have not had sexual relations with a man?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answered and said to her,“The Holy Spirit will come upon you,and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.Therefore also the one to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And behold, your relative Elizabeth—she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For ˻nothing will be impossible with God˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>So Mary said, “Behold, the Lord’s female slave! May it happen to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>Now in those days Mary set out and traveled with haste into the hill country, to a town of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and entered into the house of Zechariah, and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it happened that when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby in her womb leaped and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>And she cried out with a loud shout and said,“Blessed are you among women,and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed is she who believed that there will be a fulfillment to what was spoken to her from the Lord!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said,“My soul exalts the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>and my spirit has rejoiced greatly in God my Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>because he has looked upon the humble state of his female slave,for behold, from now on all generations will consider me blessed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>because the Mighty One has done great things for me,and holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And his mercy is for generation after generationto those who fear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has done a mighty deed with his arm;he has dispersed the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He has brought down rulers from their thrones,and has exalted the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He has filled those who are hungry with good things,and those who are rich he has sent away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has helped Israel his servant,remembering his mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>just as he spoke to our fathers,to Abraham and to his descendants ˻forever˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now the time came for Elizabeth that she should give birth, and she gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbors and relatives heard that ˻the Lord had shown his great mercy to her˼, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were wanting to name him ˻after˼ his father Zechariah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother answered and said, “No, but he will be named John.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said to her, “There is no one of your relatives who is called by this name.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>So they made signs to his father asking what he wanted him to be named,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>and he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, saying, “John is his name.” And they were all astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And his mouth and his tongue were opened immediately, and he began to speak, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came on all those who lived near them, and in all the hill country of Judea all these events were discussed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all those who heard kept these things in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be? For indeed the hand of the Lord was with him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,because he has visited to help and ˻has redeemed˼ his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>and has raised up a horn of salvation for usin the house of his servant David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>just as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from earliest times—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all those who hate us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>to show mercy to our fathersand to remember his holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>the oath that he swore to Abraham our father,to grant us</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies,could serve him without fear</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>in holiness and righteousnessbefore him all our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And so you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High,for you will go on before the Lord to prepare his ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>to give knowledge of salvation to his peopleby the forgiveness of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>because of the merciful compassion of our Godby which the dawn will visit to help us from on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,to direct our feet into the way of peace.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child kept growing and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>Now it happened that in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to register all the empire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>(This first registration took place when Quirinius was governor of Syria.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And everyone went to be registered, each one to his own town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>So Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family line of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to be registered together with Mary, who was legally promised in marriage to him and was pregnant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And it happened that while they were there, ˻the time came˼ for her to give birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she gave birth to her firstborn son, and wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And there were shepherds in the same region, living out of doors and keeping watch, guarding over their flock by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And an angel of the Lord stood near them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and ˻they were terribly frightened˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring good news to you of great joy which will be for all the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>that today a Savior, who is Christ the Lord, was born for you in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this will be the sign for you: you will find the baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>“Glory to God in the highest,and on earth peaceamong people ˻with whom he is pleased˼!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And it happened that when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds began to say to one another, “Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has revealed to us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they went hurrying and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby who was lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And when they saw it, they made known the statement that had been told to them about this child.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>in the time of the high priest Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he went into all the surrounding region of the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah,“The voice of one crying out in the wilderness,‘Prepare the way of the Lord,make his paths straight!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>and all flesh will see the salvation of God.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>Therefore he was saying to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, “Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentence! And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And even now the ax is positioned at the root of the trees; therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>And the crowds were asking him, saying, “What then should we do?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>And he answered and said to them, “The one who has two tunics must share with the one who does not have one, and the one who has food must do likewise.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>And tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what should we do?”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>And those who served in the army were also asking him, saying, “What should we also do?” And he said to them, “Extort from no one, and do not blackmail anyone, and be content with your pay.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>And while the people were waiting expectantly and all were pondering in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he might be the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>John answered them all, saying, “I baptize you with water, but the one who is more powerful than I am is coming, of whom I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.17'>His winnowing shovel is in his hand, to clean out his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.18'>So with many other exhortations also he proclaimed good news to the people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.1'>And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.3'>So the devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, order this stone that it become bread!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.5'>And he led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.6'>And the devil said to him, “I will give you all this domain and their glory, because it has been handed over to me, and I can give it to whomever I want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.7'>So if you will worship before me, all this will be yours.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.8'>And Jesus answered and said to him, “It is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.9'>And he brought him to Jerusalem, and had him stand on the highest point of the temple and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.15'>And he began to teach in their synagogues, and was praised by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.16'>And he came to Nazareth, where ˻he had been brought up˼, and according to ˻his custom˼ he entered into the synagogue on the day of the Sabbath and stood up to read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.17'>And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him, and unrolling the scroll he found the place where it was written,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.25'>But in truth I say to you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut for three years and six months while a great famine took place over all the land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.28'>And all those in the synagogue were filled with anger when they heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.29'>And they stood up and forced him out of the town and brought him up to the edge of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.30'>But he passed through their midst and went on his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>And he came down to Capernaum, a town of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.32'>And they were astounded at his teaching, because ˻he spoke˼ with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent and come out of him!” And after throwing him down in their midst, the demon came out of him without hurting him at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>And amazement came upon them all, and they began to talk with one another, saying, “What word is this? For he commands the unclean spirits with authority and power, and they come out!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.37'>And news about him went out into every place of the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>And after he set out from the synagogue, he went into Simon’s house. And Simon’s mother-in-law was afflicted with a high fever, and they asked him on behalf of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she got up and began to serve them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>Now as the sun was setting, all who had those who were sick with various diseases brought them to him, and placing his hands on every one of them, he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>And demons also were coming out of many, crying out and saying, “You are the Son of God!” And he rebuked themand did not permit them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>And when it was day, he departed and went to an isolated place. And the crowds were seeking him, and came to him and were trying to prevent him from departing from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>But he said to them, “It is necessary for me to proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because I was sent for this purpose.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing around him and hearing the word of God, he was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>and he saw two boats there beside the lake, but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>And he got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out from the land a little. And he sat down and began to teach the crowds from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>And when he stopped speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>And Simon answered and said, “Master, although we worked hard through the whole night, we caught nothing. But at your word I will let down the nets.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And when they did this, they caught a very large number of fish, and their nets began to tear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>And they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both the boats so that they began to sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>And when he saw it, Simon Peter fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, Lord, because I am ˻a sinful man˼!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>For amazement had seized him and all those who were with him at the catch of fish that they had caught,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>and so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were business partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid! From now on you will be catching people!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>And after they brought their boats to the land, they left everything and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>And it happened that while he was in one of the towns, ˻there was˼ a man ˻covered with leprosy˼. And when he saw Jesus, he fell down on his face and begged him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>And extending his hand he touched him, saying, “I am willing; be clean.” And immediately the leprosy went away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>And he ordered him, “Tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest and bring the offering for your cleansing just as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But the report about him spread even more, and large crowds were gathering to hear him and to be healed of their illnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>But he himself was withdrawing in the wilderness and praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>And it happened that on one of the days as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there who ˻had come˼ from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem, and the power of the Lord was there in order for him to heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And behold, men came carrying on a stretcher a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and place him before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>And when they did not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the roof tiles with the stretcher into the midst of them, in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>And when he saw their faith, he said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this man who speaks blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered and said to them, “Why are you reasoning in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” he said to the one who was paralyzed, “I say to you, ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and go to your home.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>And immediately he stood up before them, picked up what he had been lying on, and went away to his home, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>And amazement seized them all, and they began to glorify God. And they were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen wonderful things today!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>And after these things, he went out and saw a tax collector ˻named˼ Levi sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>And leaving everything behind, he got up and began to follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>And Levi gave a great banquet for him in his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining for the meal with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>And the Pharisees and their scribes began to complain to his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>And Jesus answered and said to them, “Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician, but those ˻who are sick˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentence.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>And they said to him, “The disciples of John fast often and make prayers—likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees—but yours are eating and drinking!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>So Jesus said to them, “You are not able to make the ˻bridegroom’s attendants˼ fast as long as the bridegroom is with them, are you?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>And he also told a parable to them: “No one tears a patch from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. Otherwise, he will have torn the new also, and the old will not match the patch that is from the new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be spilled and the wineskins will be destroyed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.1'>Now it happened that on a Sabbath he went through the grain fields, and his disciples were picking and eating the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And when they came to Jesus, they began imploring him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy that you grant this for him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>because he loves our nation and he himself built the synagogue for us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>So Jesus went with them. Now by this time he was not far away from the house, and the centurion sent friends, saying to him, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy that you should come in under my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>For this reason neither did I consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word and my slave must be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I also am a man placed under authority, who has soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another one, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>And when Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning around to the crowd that was following him, he said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And when they returned to the house, those who had been sent found the slave healthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>And it happened that on the next day he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>And as he approached the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, his mother’s only son, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion for her and said to her, “Do not weep!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>And he came up and touched the bier, and those who were carrying it stopped. And he said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and he gave him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>And fear seized them all, and they began to glorify God, saying, “A great prophet has appeared among us!” and “God has visited to help his people!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>And when the men came to him, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>In that hour he healed many people of diseases and suffering and evil spirits, and he granted sight to many blind people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>And he answered and said to them, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised, the poor have good news announced to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And whoever is not offended by me is blessed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are in splendid clothing and luxury are in the royal palaces.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>(And all the people, when they heard this—even the tax collectors—affirmed the righteousness of God, because they had been baptized with the baptism of John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>but the Pharisees and the legal experts rejected the purpose of God for themselves, because they had not been baptized by him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>“To what then shall I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another, who say,‘We played the flute for you and you did not dance;we sang a lament and you did not weep.’</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>Now one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he entered into the house of the Pharisee and reclined at the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And behold, a woman in the town who was a sinner, when she learned that he was dining in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of perfumed oil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>and standing behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and was wiping them with the hair of her head and was kissing his feet and anointing them with the perfumed oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>Now when the Pharisee who invited him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, “If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him, that she is a sinner.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>And Jesus answered and said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” And he said, “Teacher, say it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>“There were two debtors who owed a certain creditor. One owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>Simon answered and said, “I suppose that it is the one to whom he forgave more.” And he said to him, “You have judged correctly.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>And turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered into your house. You did not give me water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>You did not give me a kiss, but from the time I entered, she has not stopped kissing my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>You did not anoint my head with olive oil, but she anointed my feet with perfumed oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>˻For this reason˼ I tell you, her sins—which were many—have been forgiven, for she loved much. But the one to whom little is forgiven loves little.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>And he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>And those who were reclining at the table with him began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>And he said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>And it happened that ˻afterward˼ also he was going about from one town and village to another preaching and proclaiming the good news concerning the kingdom of God, and the twelve were with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and some women who had been healed of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (who was called Magdalene), from whom seven demons had gone out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>and Joanna the wife of Chuza (Herod’s household manager), and Susanna, and many others who were helping to support them from their possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And while a large crowd was gathering and they were going to him from town after town, he spoke by means of a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>“The sower went out to sow his seed, and while he was sowing, ˻some seed˼ fell on the side of the path and was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>And other seed fell on the rock, and when it came up, it withered, because it did not have moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And other seed fell in the midst of the thorn plants, and the thorn plants grew up with itand choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>And other seed fell on the good soil, and when it came up, it produced a hundred times as much grain.” As he said these things, he called out, “The one who has ears to hear, let him hear!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And his disciples asked him what this parable meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And he said, “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest they are in parables, so that‘Seeing they may not see,and hearing they may not understand.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now the parable means this: the seed is the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>and those beside the path are the ones who have heard. Then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>And those on the rock are those who receive the word with joy when they hear it, and these do not have enough root, who believe for a time and in a time of testing fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>And the seed that fell into the thorn plants—these are the ones who hear and as they go along are choked by the worries and riches and pleasures of life, and they do not bear fruit to maturity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But the seed on the good soil—these are the ones who, after hearing the word, hold fast to it with a noble and good heart, and bear fruit with patient endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>“And no one, after lighting a lamp, covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand, so that those who come in can see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For nothing is secret that will not become evident, and nothing hidden that will never be known and come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>Therefore consider how you listen, for whoever has, to him more will be given, and whoever does not have, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away from him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>Now his mother and brothers came to him, and they were not able to meet with him because of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>And it was reported to him, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to see you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But he answered and said to them, “These are my mother and my brothers—the ones who hear the word of God and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>Now it happened that on one of the days both he and his disciples got into a boat, and he said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side of the lake.” And they set sail,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>and as they were sailing, he fell asleep. And a storm of wind came down on the lake, and they were being swamped and were in danger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>And they came and woke him up, saying, “Master, master! We are perishing!” So he got up and rebuked the wind and the billowing waves of water and they ceased, and it became calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>And he said to them, “Where is your faith?” But they were afraid and were astonished, saying to one another, “Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>And they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>And as he got out on the land, a certain man from the town met him who had demons and for a considerable time had not worn clothes and did not live in a house, but among the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, “˻What do I have to do with you˼, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For it had seized him many times, and he was bound with chains and shackles and was guarded, and breaking the bonds he would be driven by the demon into the deserted places.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>So Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Legion,” because many demons had entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they began imploring him that he would not order them to depart into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding there on the hill, and they implored him that he would permit them to enter into those pigs. And he permitted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>So the demons came out of the man and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed headlong down the steep slope into the lake and were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>And when the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the town and in the countryside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>So they went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting there clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus, and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>And those who had seen it reported to them how the man who had been demon-possessed had been healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>And all the people of the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, because they had been seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>And the man from who the demons had gone out was begging him to stay with him, but he sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>“Return to your home and tell all that God has done for you.” And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole town all that Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, because they were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And behold, a man ˻who was named˼ Jairus came, and this man was a ruler of the synagogue. And he fell down at the feet of Jesus and began imploring him to come to his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>because ˻he had˼ an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying.Now as he was going, the crowds were pressing against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>And a woman who was ˻suffering from hemorrhages˼ for twelve years (who, although she had spent all her assets on physicians, was not able to be healed by anyone)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>came up behind himand touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately ˻her hemorrhaging˼ stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jesus said, “Who is the one who touched me?” And when they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the crowds are pressing you hard and crowding you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>But Jesus said, “Someone touched me, because I know power has gone out from me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>And when the woman saw that she did not escape notice, she came trembling and falling down before him. In the presence of all the people, she told for what reason she had touched him, and that she was healed immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>And he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While he was still speaking, someone came from the synagogue ruler’s house, saying, “Your daughter is dead! Trouble the Teacher no longer!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>But Jesus, when he heard this, replied to him, “Do not be afraid! Only believe, and she will be healed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>Now when he came to the house, he did not allow anyone to enter with him except Peter and John and James and the father and mother of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>And they were all weeping and mourning for her, but he said, “Do not weep! For she is not dead, but is sleeping.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>And they began laughing at him, because they knew that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But he took her hand and called, saying, “Child, get up.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>And her spirit returned, and she got up immediately, and he ordered something to be given to her to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>And her parents were astonished, but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>And summoning the twelve, he gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>And he said to them, “Take along nothing for the journey—neither a staff, nor a traveler’s bag, nor bread, nor money, nor to have two tunics apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.4'>And into whatever house you enter, stay there and depart from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>And as for all those who do not welcome you—when you depart from that town, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>So they departed and went throughout the villages, proclaiming the good news and healing everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was greatly perplexed, because it was said by some that John has been raised from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>and by some that Elijah had appeared, and others that some prophet of ancient times had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>And Herod said, “John I beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?” And he was wanting to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>And when they returned, the apostles described to him all that they had done. And he took them along and withdrew privately to a town called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But when the crowds found out, they followed him, and welcoming them, he began to speak to them about the kingdom of God, and he cured those who had need of healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>Now the day began to be far spent, and the twelve came up and said to him, “Send away the crowd so that they can go into the surrounding villages and farms to obtain lodging and find provisions, because we are here in a desolate place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>But he said to them, “You give them something to eat!” And they said, “˻We have no˼ more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we go and purchase food for all these people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>(For there were about five thousand men.) So he said to his disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>And they did so, and had them all sit down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them and began giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>And they all ate and were satisfied, and what was left over was picked up by them—twelve baskets of broken pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>And it happened that while he was praying alone, the disciples were with him. And he asked them, saying, “Who do the crowds say that I am?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>And they answered and said, “John the Baptist, but others, Elijah, and others, that one of the ancient prophets has risen.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>And he said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” And Peter answered and said, “The Christ of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>But he warned and commanded them to tell this to no one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>saying, “It is necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised on the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>And he said to them all, “If anyone wants to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross every day and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of me, this person will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.25'>For what is a person benefited if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of this person when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>But I tell you truly, there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>Now it happened that about eight days after these words, he took along Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>And as he was praying, the appearance of his face became different, and his clothing became white, gleaming like lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>who appeared in glory and were speaking about his departure which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>Now Peter and those with him were ˻very sleepy˼, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>And it happened that as they were going away from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he was saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>And while he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>And a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, my Chosen One. Listen to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>And after the voice had occurred, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>Now it happened that on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look with concern on my son, because he is my only son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>And behold, a spirit seizes him and suddenly he screams, and it convulses him with foam and rarely withdraws from him, battering him severely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>And I begged your disciples that they would expel it, and they were not able to do so.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>So Jesus answered and said, “O unbelieving and perverted generation! ˻How long˼ will I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>And while he was still approaching, the demon threw him down and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And they were all astounded at the impressiveness of God.But while they were all marveling at all the things that he was doing, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>“˻You take these words to heart˼, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they did not understand this statement, and it was concealed from them so that they could not understand it. And they were afraid to ask him about this statement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>And an argument developed among them as to who of them might be greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>But Jesus, because he knew the thoughts of their hearts, took hold of a child and had him stand beside him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>and said to them, “Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For the one who is least among you all—this one is great.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>And John answered and said, “Master, we saw someone expelling demons in your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he does not follow in company with us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>But Jesus said to him, “Do not prevent him, because whoever is not against you is for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>Now it happened that when the days were approaching ˻for him to be taken up˼, he set his face to go to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>And he sent messengers before ˻him˼, and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans in order to prepare for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>And they did not welcome him because ˻he was determined to go˼ to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>Now when the disciples James and John saw it, they said, “Lord, do you want us to call fire to come down from heaven and consume them?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But he turned around and rebuked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>and they proceeded to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>And as they were traveling on the road, someone said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>And he said to another, “Follow me!” But he said, “Lord, first allow me to go and bury my father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>But he said to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead! But you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>And another person also said, “I will follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say farewell to those in my house.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>But Jesus said to him, “No one who puts his hand on the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God!”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.10'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.1'>And after these things, the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them out two by two before ˻him˼ into every town and place where he was about to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.2'>And he said to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest that he send out workers into his harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.3'>Go! Behold, I am sending you out like lambs in the midst of wolves!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.4'>Do not carry a money bag or a traveler’s bag or sandals, and greet no one along the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.5'>And into whatever house you enter, first say, “Peace be to this household!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.6'>And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him. But if not, it will return to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.7'>And remain in the same house, eating and drinking ˻whatever they provide˼, for the worker is worthy of his pay. Do not move from house to house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.9'>and heal the sick in it, and say to them, “The kingdom of God has come near to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.10'>But into whatever town you enter and they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.11'>“Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you! Nevertheless know this: that the kingdom of God has come near!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.12'>I tell you that it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.13'>Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.14'>But it will be more bearable for Tyre and for Sidon in the judgment than for you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.15'>And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to Hades!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.16'>The one who listens to you listens to me, and the one who rejects you rejects me. But the one who rejects me rejects the one who sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.17'>And the seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.18'>So he said to them, “I saw Satan falling like lightning from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.19'>Behold, I have given you the authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will ever harm you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.20'>Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are inscribed in heaven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.21'>At that same time he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to young children. Yes, Father, for this was pleasing before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.22'>All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father and who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wants to reveal him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.23'>And turning to the disciples, he said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see the things which you see!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.24'>For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and did not see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and did not hear them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.25'>And behold, a certain legal expert stood up to test him, saying, “Teacher, what must I do so that I will inherit eternal life?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.26'>And he said to him, “What is written in the law? How do you read it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.27'>And he answered and said, “You shall love the Lord your God from all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.28'>And he said to him, “You have answered correctly. Do this and you will live.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.29'>But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.30'>Jesus replied and said, “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell into the hands of robbers, who both stripped him and beat him. After inflicting blows on him, they went away, leaving him half dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.31'>Now by coincidence a certain priest was going down on that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.32'>And in the same way also a Levite who happened by the place, when he came up to him and saw him, passed by on the opposite side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.33'>But a certain Samaritan who was traveling came up to him and, when he saw him, had compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.34'>And he came up and bandaged his wounds, pouring on olive oil and wine, and he put him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.35'>And on the next day, he took out and gave two denarii to the innkeeper, and said, “Take care of him, and whatever you spend in addition, I will repay to you when I return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.36'>Which of these three do you suppose became a neighbor of the man who fell among the robbers?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.37'>So he said, “The one who showed mercy to him.” And Jesus said to him, “You go and do likewise.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.11'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.1'>And it happened that while he was in a certain place praying, when he stopped a certain one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.15.3'>So he told them this parable, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.4'>“What man of you, having a hundred sheep and losing one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the grassland and go after the one that was lost until he finds it?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.15.13'>And after not many days, the younger son gathered everything and went on a journey to a distant country, and there he squandered his wealth by living wastefully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.14'>And after he had spent everything, there was a severe famine throughout that country, and he began to be in need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.15'>And he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to tend pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.16'>And he was longing to stuff himself with the carob pods that the pigs were eating, and no one was giving anything to him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.16.8'>And the master praised the dishonest manager, because he had acted shrewdly. For the sons of this age are shrewder than the sons of light with regard to their own generation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'>And he also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and looked down on ˻everyone else˼:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>The Pharisee stood and prayed these things with reference to himself: ‘God, I give thanks to you that I am not like other people—swindlers, unrighteous people, adulterers, or even like this tax collector!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all that I get.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>But the tax collector, standing far away, did not want even to raise his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than that one! For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.15'>Now they were bringing even their babies to him so that he could touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.16'>But Jesus called them to himself, saying, “Allow the children to come to me, and do not forbid them, ˻for to such belongs˼ the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.17'>Truly I say to you, whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a young child will never enter into it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.18'>And a certain ruler asked him, saying, “Good Teacher, by doing what will I inherit eternal life?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.19'>And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.20'>You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.21'>And he said, “All these I have observed from my youth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.22'>And when he heard this, Jesus said to him, “˻You still lack one thing˼: Sell all that you have, and distribute the proceeds to the poor—and you will have treasure in heaven—and come, follow me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.23'>But when he heard these things he became very sad, because he was extremely wealthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.24'>And when Jesus saw him becoming very sad, he said, “How ˻difficult it is for˼ those who possess wealth to enter into the kingdom of God!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.31'>And taking aside the twelve, he said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written by the prophets with reference to the Son of Man will be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.32'>For he will be handed over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and mistreated and spit on,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.34'>And they understood none of these things, and this saying was concealed from them, and they did not comprehend the things that were said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.35'>Now it happened that as he drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting on the side of the road begging.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.36'>And when he heard a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.37'>And they told him, “Jesus the Nazarene is passing by.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.38'>And he called out, saying, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.39'>And those who were in front rebuked him, that he should be silent, but he cried out ˻even more loudly˼, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.40'>So Jesus stopped and ordered him to be brought to him. And when he approached, he asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.41'>“What do you want me to do for you?” And he said, “Lord, that I may regain my sight.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.6'>And he came down quickly and welcomed him joyfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.7'>And when they saw it, they all began to complain, saying, “He has gone in to find lodging with a man who is a sinner!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.8'>And Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, “Behold, half of my possessions, Lord, I am giving to the poor, and if I have extorted anything from anyone, I am paying it back four times as much!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.9'>And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.10'>For the Son of Man came to seek and to save those who are lost.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>Now while they were listening to these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>Therefore he said, “A certain nobleman traveled to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>And summoning ten of his own slaves, he gave them ten minas and said to them, ‘Do business ˻until I come back˼.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.14'>But his citizens hated him, and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to be king over us!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.15'>And it happened that when he returned after receiving the kingdom, he ordered these slaves to whom he had given the money to be summoned to him, so that he could know what they had gained by trading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.16'>So the first arrived, saying, ‘Sir, your mina has made ten minas more!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>And he said to him, ‘Well done, good slave! Because you have been faithful in a very small thing, ˻have authority˼ over ten cities.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.18'>And the second came, saying, ‘Sir, your mina has made five minas.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.19'>So he said to this one also, ‘And you be over five cities.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.20'>And another came, saying, ‘Sir, behold your mina, which I had put away for safekeeping in a piece of cloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.21'>For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man—you withdraw what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.22'>He said to him, ‘˻By your own words˼ I will judge you, wicked slave! You knew that I am a severe man, withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.23'>And why did you not give my money to the bank, and I, when I returned, would have collected it with interest?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.24'>And to the bystanders he said, ‘Take away from him the mina and give it to the one who has the ten minas!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.25'>And they said to him, ‘Sir, he has ten minas.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.26'>‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given. But from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.27'>But these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them here and slaughter them in my presence!’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.28'>And after he had said these things, he traveled on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.29'>And it happened that when he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.30'>saying, ‘Go into the village in front of you, in which as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which ˻no person has ever˼ sat, and untie it and bring it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.31'>And if anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you will say this: ‘The Lord has need of it.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.32'>So those who were sent went and found it just as he had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, ‘Why are you untying the colt?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>So they said, ‘The Lord has need of it.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.35'>And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they put Jesus on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>And as he was going along, they were spreading out their cloaks on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>Now as he was drawing near by this time to the descent from the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of the disciples began rejoicing to praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles that they had seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>saying,“Blessed is the king,the one who comes in the name of the Lord!Peace in heavenand glory in the highest!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.39'>And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.40'>And he answered and said, “I tell you, if these keep silent, the stones will cry out!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>And when he approached and saw the city, he wept over it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.42'>saying, “If you had known on this day—even you—the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.43'>For days will come upon you and your enemies will put up an embankment against you, and will surround you and press you hard from all directions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.44'>And they will raze you to the ground, you and your children within you, and will not leave a stone upon a stone within you, ˻because˼ you did not recognize the time of your visitation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.45'>And he entered into the temple courtsand began to drive out those who were selling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.46'>saying to them, “It is written, ‘And my house will be a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a cave of robbers!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.47'>And he was teaching every day in the temple courts, and the chief priests and the scribes and the most prominent men of the people were seeking to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.48'>And they did not find anything they could do, because all the people were paying close attention to what they were hearing from him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>And it happened that on one of the days while he was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes approached together with the elders</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>and said, saying to him, “Tell us, by what authority you are doing these things, or who is the one who gave you this authority?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>And he answered and said to them, “I also will ask you a question, and you tell me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>The baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>And they discussed this with one another, saying, “If we say ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us to death, because they are convinced that John was a prophet.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>And they replied that they did not know where it was from.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>And he began to tell the people this parable: “A certain man planted a vineyard, and leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>And at the proper time he sent a slave to the tenant farmers, so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenant farmers sent him away empty-handed after beating him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>And he proceeded to send another slave, but they beat and dishonored that one also, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>And he proceeded to send a third, but they wounded and threw out this one also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>So the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the tenant farmers saw him, they began to reason with one another, saying, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him so that the inheritance will become ours!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and destroy those tenant farmers and give the vineyard to others.” And when they heard this, they said, “May this never happen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>But he looked intently at them and said, “What then is this that is written:‘The stone which the builders rejected,this has become ˻the cornerstone˼.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and the one on whom it falls—it will crush him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay their hands on him at that same hour, and they were afraid of the people, for they knew that he had told this parable with reference to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And they watched him closely and sent spies who pretended they were upright, in order that they could catch him in a statement, so that they could hand him over to the authority and the jurisdiction of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>And they asked him, saying, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and do not ˻show partiality˼, but teach the way of God in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it permitted for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But seeing through their craftiness, he said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>“Show me a denarius! Whose image and inscription does it have?” And they said, “Caesar’s.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>So he said to them, “Well then, give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>And they were not able to catch him in a statement in the sight of the people, and astonished at his answer, they became silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Now some of the Sadducees—who deny ˻that there is a resurrection˼—came up and asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us if someone’s brother dies having a wife, and this man is childless, that his brother should take the wife and ˻father˼ descendants for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>Now there were seven brothers, and the first took a wife and died childless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>and the second,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>and the third took her, and likewise also the seven did not leave children and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Finally the woman also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>Therefore in the resurrection, the woman—whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And Jesus said to them, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>for they are not even able to die any longer, because they are like the angels and are sons of God, because they are sons of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>But that the dead are raised, even Moses revealed in the passage about the bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>And some of the scribes answered and said, “Teacher, you have spoken well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>For they no longer dared to ask him anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>But he said to them, “In what sense do they say that the Christ is David’s son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>For David himself says in the book of Psalms,‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>until I make your enemiesa footstool for your feet.” ’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>David therefore calls him ‘Lord,’ and how is he his son?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>And while all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>“Beware of the scribes, who like walking around in long robes and who love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>who devour the houses of widows and pray lengthy prayers for the sake of appearance. These will receive more severe condemnation!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.21'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.1'>And he looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the contribution box,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.2'>and he saw a certain poor widow putting in there two small copper coins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.3'>And he said, “Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.4'>For these all put gifts into the offering out of their abundance, but this woman out of her poverty put in all the means of subsistence that she had.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.5'>And while some were speaking about the temple, that it was adorned with precious stones and votive offerings, he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.6'>“As for these things that you see—days will come in which not one stone will be left on another stone that will not be thrown down!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.7'>And they asked him, saying, “Teacher, when therefore will these things happen, and what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.8'>And he said, Watch out that you are not deceived! For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and ‘The time is near!’ Do not go after them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.9'>And when you hear about wars and insurrections, do not be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end will not be at once.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.10'>Then he said to them, “nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.11'>There will be great earthquakes and famines and plagues in various places. There will be terrible sights and great signs from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.12'>“But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, handing you over to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and governors because of my name.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.16'>And you will be handed over even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put to death some of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.17'>And you will be hated by all because of my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.18'>Even a hair of your head will never perish!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.19'>By your patient endurance you will gain your lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.20'>“But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.21'>Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those ˻inside it˼ must depart, and those in the fields must not enter into it,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.23'>Woe to those ˻who are pregnant˼ and to those who are nursing their babies in those days! For there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.24'>and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.25'>“And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity from the noise of the sea and its surging,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.36'>But be alert at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these thingsthat are going to happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.37'>So throughout the days he was teaching in the temple courts, and throughout the nights he was going out and spending the night on the hill that is called the Mount of Olives.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.22'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.1'>Now the feast of Unleavened Bread (which is called Passover) was drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.2'>And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they could destroy him, because they were afraid of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.3'>And Satan entered into Judas, the one called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers of the temple guard how he could betray him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>And they were delighted, and came to an agreement with him to give him money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>And he agreed, and began looking for a favorable opportunity to betray him to them apart from the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>And the day of the feast of Unleavened Bread came, on which it was necessary for the Passover lamb to be sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>And he sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.9'>So they said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.10'>And he said to them, “Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.11'>And you will say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” ’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.12'>And he will show you a large furnished upstairs room. Make preparations there.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.13'>So they went and found everything just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>And when the hour came, he reclined at the table, and the apostles with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.15'>And he said to them, “˻I have earnestly desired˼ to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.17'>And he took in hand a cup, andafter giving thanks he said, “Take this and share it among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.18'>For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the product of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.19'>And he took bread, andafter giving thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.20'>And in the same way the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood which is poured out for you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.32'>but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. And you, when once you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.33'>But he said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.34'>And he said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.35'>And he said to them, “When I sent you out without a money bag and a traveler’s bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?” And they said, “Nothing.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.36'>And he said to them, “But now the one who has a money bag must take it, and likewise a traveler’s bag. And the one who does not have a sword must sell his cloak and buy one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.37'>For I tell you that this that is written must be fulfilled in me: ‘And he was counted with the criminals.’ For indeed, what is written about me ˻is being fulfilled˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.38'>So they said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords!” And he said to them, “It is adequate.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>And he went away and proceeded, according to his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>And when he came to the place, he said to them, “Pray that you will not enter into temptation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw and ˻knelt down˼and began to pray,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>saying, “Father, if you are willing, take away this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will but yours be done.” 〚</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>And an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>And being in anguish, he began praying more fervently and his sweat became like drops of blood falling down to the ground.〛</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>And when he got up from the prayer and came to the disciples, he found them sleeping from sorrow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>and he said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you will not enter into temptation!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>While he was still speaking, behold, there came a crowd, and the one named Judas, one of the twelve, leading them. And he approached Jesus to kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.48'>But Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.49'>And when those around him saw what was about to happen, they said, “Lord, should we strike with the sword?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.50'>And a certain one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.51'>But Jesus answered and said, “˻Stop! No more of this!˼” And he touched his ear and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>And Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come out against him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>Every day when I was with you in the temple courts, you did not stretch out your hands against me! But this is your hour and the domain of darkness!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>And they arrested him and led him away and brought him into the house of the high priest. But Peter was following at a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>And a certain female slave, seeing him sitting in the light and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>And after a short time another person saw him and said, “You also are one of them!” But Peter said, “Man, I am not!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>And after about one hour had passed, someone else was insisting, saying, “In truth this man also was with him, because he is also a Galilean!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about!” And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>And the Lord turned around and looked intently at Peter. And Peter remembered the Lord’s statement, how he said to him, “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>And he went outside and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>And the men who were guarding him began to mock him while they beat him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>and after blindfolding him they repeatedly asked him, saying, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And they were saying many other things against him, reviling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>And when day came, the council of elders of the people gathered, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away to their Sanhedrin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>saying, “If you are the Christ, tell us!” But he said to them, “If I tell you, you will never believe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>and if I ask you, you will never answer!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.70'>So they all said, “Are you then the Son of God?” And he said to them, “You say that I am.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.71'>And they said, “Why do we have need of further testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his mouth!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>And the whole assembly of them rose up and brought him before Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>And they began to accuse him, saying, “We have found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying he himself is Christ, a king!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>And Pilate asked him, saying, “Are you the king of the Jews?” And he answered him and said, “You say so.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>So Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for an accusation against this man.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they insisted, saying, “He incites the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea and beginning from Galilee as far as here.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>Now when Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>And when he found out that he was from the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him over to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him and was hoping to see some miracle performed by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>So he questioned him ˻at considerable length˼, but he answered nothing to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>And the chief priests and the scribes were standing there vehemently accusing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>And Herod with his soldiers also treated him with contempt, and after mocking himand dressing himin glistening clothing, he sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>And both Herod and Pilate became friends with one another on that same day, ˻for they had previously been enemies of one another˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>So Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people, and behold, when I examined him before you, I found nothing in this man as basis for the accusation which ˻you are making˼ against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>But neither did Herod, because he sent him back to us. And behold, nothing deserving death ˻has been done˼ by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>Therefore I will punish him and release him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>But they all cried out in unison, saying, “Take this man away, and release for us Barabbas!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>(who had been thrown in prison because of a certain insurrection that had taken place in the city, and for murder).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>And Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>but they kept crying out, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>So he said to them a third time, “Why? What wrong has this man done? I found no basis for an accusation ˻deserving death˼ in him. Therefore I will punish him and release him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he be crucified. And their cries prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>And Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And he released the one who had been thrown into prison because of insurrection and murder, whom they were asking for, but Jesus he handed over to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And as they led him away, they seized Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and placed the cross on him, to carry it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And a great crowd of the people were following him, and of women who were mourning and lamenting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But turning to them, Jesus said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For behold, days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that did not give birth, and the breasts that did not nurse!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they do these things˻when the wood is green˼, what will happen ˻when it is dry˼?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And two other criminals were also led away to be executed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they came to the place that is called “The Skull,” there they crucified him, and the criminals, the one on his right and the other on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>〚But Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”〛 And they cast lots to divide his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people stood there watching, but the rulers also ridiculed him, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself, if this man is the Christ of God, the Chosen One!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And there was also an inscription over him, “This is the king of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>And one of the criminals who were hanged there reviled him, saying, “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself—and us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other answered and rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, because you are undergoing the same condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly, for we are receiving ˻what we deserve˼for what we have done. But this man has done nothing wrong!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And he said to him, “Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>And by this time it was about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>becausethe light of the sun failed. And the curtain of the temple was torn apart down the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit!” And after he said this, he expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he began to praise God, saying, “Certainly this man was righteous!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the crowds that had come together for this spectacle, when they saw the things that had happened, returned home beating their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And all his acquaintances, and the women who had followed him from Galilee who saw these things, stood at a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And behold, a man ˻named˼ Joseph, who was a member of the council and a good and righteous man</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(this man was not consenting to their plan and deed), from Arimathea, ˻a Judean town˼, who was looking forward to the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth and placed him in a tomb cut into the rock where no one had ever been placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And it was the day of preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women who had been accompanying him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>And they returned and prepared fragrant spices and perfumes, and on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>Now on the first day of the week, at very early dawn, they came back to the tomb bringing the fragrant spices which they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>And they found the stone had been rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>but when they went in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it happened that while they were perplexed about this, behold, two men in gleaming clothing stood near them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>And as they were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, “Why are you looking for the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but has been raised! Remember how he spoke to you while he was still in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of men who are sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day rise?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered his words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>and when they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>Now Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the others with them were telling these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they refused to believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Peter got up and ran to the tomb, and bending over to look, he saw only the strips of linen cloth, and he went away to his home wondering what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And behold, on that same day, two of them were traveling to a village ˻named˼ Emmaus that was sixty stadia distant from Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>and they were conversing with one another about all these things that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>And it happened that while they were conversing, and discussing, Jesus himself also approached and began to go along with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said to them, “What are these matters that you are discussing with one another as you are walking along?” And they stood still, looking sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And one of them, ˻named˼ Cleopas, answered and said to him, “Are you the only one living near Jerusalem and not knowing the things that have happened in it in these days?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And he said to them, “What things?” So they said to him, “The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, a man who was a prophet, powerful in deed and word before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over to a sentence of death, and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we were hoping that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. But in addition to all these things, this is the third day ˻since˼ these things took place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>But also some women from among us astonished us, who were at the tomb early in the morning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and when they did not find his body, they came back saying they had seen even a vision of angels, who said that he was alive!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And some of those with us went out to the tomb and found it like this, just as the women had also said, but him they did not see.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>And he said to them, “O foolish and slow in heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Was it not necessary that the Christ suffer these things and enter into his glory?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things concerning himself in all the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they drew near to the village where they were going, and he acted as though he was going farther.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>And they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, because it is getting toward evening, and by this time the day is far spent.” And he went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it happened that when he reclined at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks, and after breaking it, he gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he became invisible to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said to one another, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he was speaking with us on the road, while he was explaining the scriptures to us?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And they got up that same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven and those with them assembled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying, “The Lord has really been raised, and has appeared to Simon!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they began describing ˻what happened˼ on the road, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>And while they were saying these things, he himself stood there among them and said to them, “Peace to you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But they were startled and became terrified, and thought they had seen a ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said to them, “Why are you frightened? And for what reason do doubts arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Look at my hands and my feet, that I am I myself! Touch me and see, because a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as ˻you see that I have˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>And while they were still disbelieving because of joy and were marveling, he said to them, “Do you have anything ˻to eat˼ here?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>So they gave him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>and he took itand ate it in front of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything that is written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and psalms must be fulfilled.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>and said to them, “Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer and would rise from the dead on the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and repentance for the forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>You are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And behold, I am sending what was promised by my Father upon you, but you stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it happened that while he was blessing them, he parted from them and was taken up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>And they were ˻continually˼ in the temple courts praising God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became flesh and took up residence among us, and we saw his glory, glory as of the one and only from the Father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John testified about him and cried out, saying, “This one was he about whom I said, ‘The one who comes after me is ahead of me, because he existed before me.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>For from his fullness we have all received, and grace after grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one has seen God at any time; the one and only, God, the one who is in the bosom of the Father—that one has made him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem so that they could ask him, “Who are you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he confessed—and he did not deny, and confessed—“I am not the Christ!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” And he said, “I am not!” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we can give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said,“I am ‘the voice of one crying out in the wilderness,“Make straight the way of the Lord,” ’just as Isaiah the prophet said.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>(And they had been sent from the Pharisees.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him and said to him, “Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, “I baptize with water. In your midst stands one whom you do not know—</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>the one who comes after me, of whom I am not worthy ˻to untie˼ the strap of his sandal!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things took place in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>On the next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This one is the one about whom I said, ‘After me is coming a man who is ahead of me, because he existed before me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And I did not know him, but in order that he could be revealed to Israel, because of this I came baptizing with water.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and remaining upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water, that one said to me, ‘The one upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him—this one is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I have seen and testify that this one is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>On the next day again John was standing there, and two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>and looking at Jesus as he was walking by, he said, “Look! The Lamb of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>And Jesus, turning around and seeing them following him, said to them, “What do you seek?” And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means when translated “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He said to them, “Come and you will see!” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day (it was about the tenth hour).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard John and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>This one first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is translated “Christ”).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>He brought him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, “You are Simon the son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is interpreted “Peter”).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>On the next day he wanted to depart for Galilee, and he found Philip. And Jesus said to him, “Follow me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>(Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found the one whom Moses wrote about in the law, and the prophets wrote about—Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him, “Look! ˻A true Israelite˼ in whom is no deceit!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael said to him, “From where do you know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the king of Israel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said to him, “Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And he said to him, “Truly, truly I say to all of you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And on the third day, there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And when the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>And Jesus said to her, “What ˻does your concern have to do with me˼, woman? My hour has not yet come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now six stone water jars were set there, in accordance with the ceremonial cleansing of the Jews, each holding two or three measures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said to them, “Fill the water jars with water.” And they filled them to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And he said to them, “Now draw some out and take it to the head steward. So they took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>Now when the head steward tasted the water which had become wine and did not know where it was from—but the servants who had drawn the water knew—the head steward summoned the bridegroom</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and said to him, “˻Everyone˼ serves the good wine first, and whenever they are drunk, the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of signs Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee, and revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went down to Capernaum, and his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there ˻a few˼ days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And he found in the temple courts those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And he made a whip of cords and drove them all out of the temple courts, both the sheep and the oxen, and he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And to the ones selling the doves he said, “Take these things away from here! Do not make my Father’s house ˻a marketplace˼!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>His disciples remembered that it is written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>So the Jews answered and said to him, “What sign do you show to us, because you are doing these things?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>Then the Jews said, “This temple has been under construction forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he was speaking about the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>So when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the scripture and the saying that Jesus had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name because they saw his signs which he was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus himself did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and because he did not ˻need˼ anyone ˻to testify˼ about man, for he himself knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was a man of the Pharisees ˻whose name was˼ Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>This man came to him at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one is able to perform these signs that you are performing unless God were with him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone is born from above, he is not able to see the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is an old man? He is not able to enter into his mother’s womb for the second time and be born, can he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone is born of water and spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Do not be astonished that I said to you, ‘It is necessary for you to be born from above.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind blows wherever it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered and said to him, “How can these things be?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and you do not understand these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Truly, truly I say to you, we speak what we know, and we testify about what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I tell you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>And no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven—the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, thus it is necessary that the Son of Man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For in this way God loved the world, so that he gave his one and only Son, in order that everyone who believes in him will not perish, but will have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God did not send his Son into the world in order that he should judge the world, but in order that the world should be saved through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>The one who believes in him is not judged, but the one who does not believe has already been judged, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the judgment: that the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds be exposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, in order that his deeds may be revealed, that they are done in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things Jesus and his disciples came into Judean territory, and there he spent time with them and was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and they were coming and were being baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>(For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>So a dispute occurred on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew concerning purification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, about whom you testified—look, this one is baptizing, and all are coming to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered and said, “A man can receive not one thing unless it is granted to him from heaven!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves testify about me that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I am sent before that one.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices ˻greatly˼ because of the bridegroom’s voice. So this joy of mine is complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>It is necessary for that one to increase, but for me to decrease.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>The one who comes from above is over all. The one who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks from the earth; the one who comes from heaven is over all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>What he has seen and heard, this he testifies, and no one accepts his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>The one who accepts his testimony has attested that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God, for he does not give the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life—but the wrath of God remains on him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Judea and departed again for Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>And it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>Now he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>And Jacob’s well was there, so Jesus, because he had become tired from the journey, simply sat down at the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me water to drink.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>(For his disciples had gone away into the town so that they could buy food.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>So the Samaritan woman said to him, “How do you, being a Jew, ask from me water to drink, since I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered and said to her, “If you had known the gift of God and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me water to drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman said to him, “Sir, you have no bucket and the well is deep! From where then do you get this living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>You are not greater than our father Jacob, are you, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, and his sons and his livestock?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>But whoever drinks of this water which I will give to him will never be thirsty for eternity, but the water which I will give to him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or come here to draw water!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>He said to her, “Go, call your husband and come here.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered and said to him, “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her, “You have said rightly, ‘I do not have a husband,’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you have now is not your husband; this you have said truthfully!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus said to her, “Believe me, woman, that an hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But an hour is coming—and now is here—when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for indeed the Father seeks such peopleto be his worshipers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is spirit, and the ones who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (the one called Christ); “whenever that one comes, he will proclaim all things to us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus said to her, “I, the one speaking to you, am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And at this point his disciples came, and they were astonished that he was speaking with a woman. However, no one said, “What do you seek?” or “Why are you speaking with her?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>So the woman left her water jar and went away into the town and said to the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>“Come, see a man who told me everything I have ever done! Perhaps this one is the Christ?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They went out from the town and were coming to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>In the meanwhile the disciples were asking him, saying, “Rabbi, eat something!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>So the disciples began to say to one another, “No one brought him anything to eat, did they?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus said to them, “My food is that I do the will of the one who sent me and complete his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months and the harvest comes’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>The one who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life, in order that the one who sows and the one who reaps can rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For in this instance the saying is true, ‘It is one who sows and another who reaps.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap what you did not work for; others have worked, and you have entered into their work.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>Now from that town many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me everything that I have done.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans came to him, they began asking him to stay with them. And he stayed there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed because of his word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>And they were saying to the woman, “No longer because of ˻what you said˼ do we believe, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this one is truly the Savior of the world!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>And after the two days he departed from there into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own homeland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, because they had seen all the things he had done in Jerusalem at the feast (for they themselves had also come to the feast).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>Now he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was at Capernaum a certain royal official whose son was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>This man, when he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, went to him and asked that he come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>So Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The royal official said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus said to him, “Go, your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>Now as he was going down, his slaves met him, saying that his child was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>So he inquired from them the hour at which he had gotten better. Then they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>So the father knew that it was at that same hour at which Jesus said to him, “Your son will live,” and he himself believed, and his whole household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>Now this is again a second sign Jesus performed when he came from Judea into Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After these thingsthere was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool called in Aramaic Bethzatha, which has five porticoes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these were lying a large number of those who were sick, blind, lame, paralyzed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>And a certain man was there who had been thirty-eight years in his sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>Jesus, when he saw this one lying there and knew that he had been sick a long time already, said to him, “Do you want to become well?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The one who was sick answered him, “Sir, I do not have anyone that, whenever the water is stirred up, could put me into the pool. But ˻while˼ I am coming, another goes down before me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And immediately the man became well and picked up his mat and began to walk. (Now it was the Sabbath on that day.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>So the Jews were saying to the one who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not permitted for you to pick up your mat!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>But he answered them, “The one who made me well—that one said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk!’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Pick up your mat and walk?’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn while a crowd was in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>After these things Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “Look, you have become well! Sin no longer, lest something worse happen to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went and reported to the Jews that Jesus was the one who made him well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>And on account of this the Jews began to persecute Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I am working.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>So on account of this the Jews were seeking even more to kill him, because he not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God his own Father, thus making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>So Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, the Son can do nothing from himself except what he sees the Father doing. For whatever that one does, these things also the Son does likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he himself is doing. And greater works than these he will show him, so that you will be astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For just as the Father raises the dead and makes them alive, thus also the Son makes alive whomever he wishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For the Father does not judge anyone, but he has given all judgment to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>in order that all people will honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Truly, truly I say to you that the one who hears my word and who believes the one who sent me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>“Truly, truly I say to you, that an hour is coming—and now is here—when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and the ones who hear will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For just as the Father has life in himself, thus also he has granted to the Son to have life in himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>And he has granted him authority to carry out judgment, because he is the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>“Do not be astonished at this, because an hour is coming in which all those in the tombs will hear his voice</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and they will come out—those who have done good things to a resurrection of life, but those who have practiced evil things to a resurrection of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I am able to do nothing from myself. Just as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>(And I do not receive testimony from people, but I say these things in order that you may be saved.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>That one was the lamp which was burning and shining, and you wanted to rejoice for an hour in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>“But I have a testimony greater than John’s, for the works which the Father has given to me that I should complete them—the very works which I am doing—these testify about me, that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father who sent me, that one has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>And you do not have his word residing in yourselves, because the one whom that one sent, in this one you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>You search the scriptures because you think that you have eternal life in them, and it is these that testify about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>And you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>“I do not accept glory from people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>but I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me. If another should come in his own name, you would accept that one!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How are you able to believe, if you accept glory from one another, and do not seek the glory which is from the only God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father! The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have put your hope!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For if you had believed Moses, you would believe me, for that one wrote about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if you do not believe that one’s writings, how will you believe my words?”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee (that is, Tiberias).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>And a large crowd was following him because they were observing the signs that he was doing on those who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>So Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>(Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>˻Then Jesus, when he looked up˼  and saw that a large crowd was coming to him, said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread so that these people can eat?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>(Now he said this to test him, because he knew what he was going to do.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip replied to him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be enough for them, in order that each one could receive a little.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>“Here is a boy who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so many people?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Jesus said, “Make the people recline.” (Now there was a lot of grass in the place.) So the men reclined, approximately five thousand in number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>Then Jesus took the bread, and after he had given thanks, he distributed it to those who were reclining—likewise also of the fish, as much as they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>And when they were satisified, he said to his disciples, “Gather the remaining fragments so that nothing is lost.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>So they gathered them, and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>Now when the people saw the sign that he performed, they began to say, “This one is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Then Jesus, because he knew that they were about to come and seize him in order to make him king, withdrew again up the mountain by himself alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>Now when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>And getting into a boat, they began to go to the other side of the sea, to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>And the sea began to be stirred up because a strong wind was blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>Then when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But he said to them, “It is I! Do not be afraid!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>So they were wanting to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat came to the land to which they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>On the next day, the crowd that was on the other side of the sea saw that other boats were not there (except one), and that Jesus had not entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had departed alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus replied to them and said, “Truly, truly I say to you, you seek me not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were satisfied!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Do not work for the food that perishes, but the food that remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has set his seal on this one.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>So they said to him, “What shall we do that we can accomplish the works of God?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered and said to them, “This is the work of God: that you believe in the one whom that one sent.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>So they said to him, “Then what sign will you perform, so that we can see it and believe you? What will you do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Then Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, Moses did not give you bread from heaven, but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>So they said to him, “Sir, always give us this bread!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. The one who comes to me will never be hungry, and the one who believes in me will never be thirsty again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But I said to you that you have seen me and do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never throw out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>because I have come down from heaven not that I should do my will, but the will of the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>Now this is the will of the one who sent me: that everyone whom he has given me, I would not lose any of them, but raise them up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks at the Son and believes in him would have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>Now the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>and they were saying, “Is this one not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus answered and said to them, “Do not grumble ˻among yourselves˼!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No one is able to come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It is written in the prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who hears from the Father and learns comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>(Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God—this one has seen the Father.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>Truly, truly I say to you, the one who believes has eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that someone may eat from it and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats from this bread, he will live ˻forever˼. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>So the Jews began to quarrel ˻among themselves˼, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>Then Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood resides in me and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so also the one who eats me—that one will live because of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This is the bread that came down from heaven, not as the fathers ate and died. The one who eats this bread will live ˻forever˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>He said these thingswhile teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Thus many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, “This saying is hard! Who can understand it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>But Jesus, because he knew within himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, “Does this cause you to be offended?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>Then what if you see the Son of Man ascending where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>The Spirit is the one who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>And he said, “Because of this I said to you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by the Father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>For this reason many of his disciples ˻drew back˼ and were not walking with him any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>So Jesus said to the twelve, “You do not want to go away also, do you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>And we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus replied to them, “Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is the devil?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>(Now he was speaking about Judas son of Simon Iscariot, because this one—one of the twelve—was going to betray him.)</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>And after these things Jesus was going about in Galilee. For he did not want to go about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now the feast of the Jews—the feast of Tabernacles—was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>So his brothers said to him, “Depart from here and go to Judea, so that your disciples also can see your works that you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For no one does anything in secret and yet he himself desires to be ˻publicly recognized˼. If you are doing these things, reveal yourself to the world!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>(For not even his brothers believed in him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>So Jesus said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I am testifying about it, that its deeds are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.8'>You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast, because my time is not yet completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>And when he had said these things, he remained in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not openly, but (as it were) in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>So the Jews were looking for him at the feast, and were saying, “Where is he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>And there was a lot of grumbling concerning him among the crowds; some were saying, “He is a good man,” but others were saying, “No, but he deceives the crowd.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>However, no one was speaking openly about him for fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>˻Now when the feast was already half over˼, Jesus went to the temple courts and began to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>Then the Jews were astonished, saying, “How does this man ˻possess knowledge˼, because he has not been taught?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>So Jesus answered them and said, “My teaching is not mine, but is from the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If anyone wants to do his will, he will know about my teaching, whether it is from God or I am speaking from myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>The one who speaks from himself seeks his own glory. But the one who seeks the glory of the one who sent him—this one is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Has not Moses given you the law, and none of you carries out the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>The crowd replied, “You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>Jesus answered and said to them, “I performed one work, and you are all astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Because of this Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'>If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses would not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a whole man well on the Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'>Do not judge according to outward appearance, but judge according to righteous judgment!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Then some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem began to say, “Is this not the one whom they are seeking to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>And behold, he is speaking openly and they are saying nothing to him! Can it be that the rulers truly know that this man is the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.27'>Yet we know where this man is from, but the Christ, whenever he comes—no one knows where he is from!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>Then Jesus cried out in the temple courts, teaching and saying, “You both know me and you know where I am from! And I have not come from myself, but the one who sent me is true, whom you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>I know him, because I am from him and he sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>So they were seeking to seize him, and no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>But from the crowd many believed in him and were saying, “Whenever the Christ comes, he will not perform more signs than this man has done, will he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers in order ˻to take him into custody ˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Then Jesus said, “Yet a little time I am with you, and I am going to the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>You will seek me and will not find me, and where I am, you cannot come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>So the Jews said to one another, “Where is this one going to go, that we will not find him? He is not going to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What is this saying that he said, ‘You will seek me and will not find me, and where I am, you cannot come’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>Now on the last day of the feast—the great day—Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me, and let him drink,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>the one who believes in me. Just as the scripture said, ‘Out of his belly will flow rivers of living water.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>Now he said this concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were about to receive. For the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>Then, when they heard these words, some from the crowd began to say, “This man is truly the Prophet!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Others were saying, “This man is the Christ!” But others were saying, “No, for the Christ does not come from Galilee, does he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'>Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>So there was a division in the crowd because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>And some of them were wanting to seize him, but no one laid hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>So the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And they said to them, “˻Why˼ did you not bring him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The officers replied, “Never has a man spoken like this!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.1'>But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.2'>Now early in the morning he came again to the temple courts. And all the people were coming to him, and he sat down and began to teach them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>Now the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery. And standing her in their midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>they said to him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'>Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>(Now they were saying this to test him, so that they would have an occasion to bring charges against him.) But Jesus, bending down, began to write with his finger on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>And when they persisted in asking him, he straightened up and said to them, “The one of you without sin, let him throw the first stone at her!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>Now when they heard it, they began to depart, one by one, beginning with the older ones, and he was left alone—and the woman who was in their midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>So straightening up, Jesus said to her, “Woman, where are they? Does no one condemn you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>And she said, “No one, Lord.” So Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go, and from now on, sin no more.”〛</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'>Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world! The one who follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.14'>Jesus answered and said to them, “Even if I testify concerning myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I have come from and where I am going. But you do not know where I have come from or where I am going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'>You judge according to externals; I do not judge anyone.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>So they were saying to him, “Where is your father?” Jesus replied, “You know neither me nor my Father! If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'>He spoke these words by the treasury while teaching in the temple courts, and no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>So he said to them again, “I am going away, and you will seek me and will die in your sin. Where I am going you cannot come!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>While he was saying these things, many believed in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>They replied to him, “We are descendants of Abraham and have not been enslaved to anyone at any time. How do you say, ‘You will become free’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.34'>Jesus replied to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.36'>So if the son sets you free, you will be truly free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'>I know that you are descendants of Abraham. But you are seeking to kill me, because my word makes no progress among you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>They answered and said to him, “Abraham is our father!” Jesus said to them, “If you are children of Abraham, do the deeds of Abraham!</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>You are doing the deeds of your father!”Then they said to him, “We were not born from sexual immorality! We have one father, God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>Jesus said to them, “If God were your father, you would love me, for I have come forth from God and have come. For I have not come from myself, but that one sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>˻Why˼ do you not understand my way of speaking? Because you are not able to listen to my message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father! That one was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand firm in the truth, because truth is not in him.

        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>But because I am telling the truth, you do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'>Who among you convicts me concerning sin? If I am telling the truth, ˻why˼ do you not believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'>The one who is from God listens to the words of God. Because of this you do not listen—because you are not of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'>The Jews answered and said to him, “Do we not correctly say that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>Jesus replied, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me!</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.52'>Then the Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham and the prophets died, and you say, ‘If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death ˻forever˼.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>You are not greater than our father Abraham who died, are you? And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself to be?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. The one who glorifies me is my Father, about whom you say, ‘He is our God.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you! But I know him and I keep his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Abraham your father rejoiced that he would see my day, and he saw it and was glad.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'>So the Jews said to him, “˻You are˼ not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.58'>Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was, I am!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.59'>Then they picked up stones in order to throw them at him. But Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple courts.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>He said these things, and after this he said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I can awaken him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>So the disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>(Now Jesus had been speaking about his death, but they thought that he was speaking about ˻real sleep˼.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>So Jesus then said to them plainly, “Lazarus has died,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>and I am glad ˻for your sake˼ that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then Thomas (the one who is called Didymus) said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go also, so that we may die with him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>So when he arrived, Jesus found he had already been four days in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>(Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>So many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary in order to console them concerning their brother.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Now Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet him, but Mary was sitting in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>So Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But even now I know that whatever you ask God, God will grant you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, even if he dies, will live,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die ˻forever˼. Do you believe this?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She said to him, “Yes, Lord, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who comes into the world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And when she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary privately, saying, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>So that one, when she heard it, got up quickly and went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>(Now Jesus has not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha went to meet him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>So the Jews who were with her in the house and were consoling her, when they saw Mary—that she stood up quickly and went out—followed her, because they thought that she was going to the tomb in order to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>Then Jesus, when he saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping, was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled within himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>And he said, “Where have you laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>So the Jews were saying, “See how he loved him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But some of them said, “Was not this man who opened the eyes of the blind able to do something so that this man also would not have died?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Then Jesus, deeply moved within himself again, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the one who had died, said to him, “Lord, he is stinking already, because it has been four days.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes above and said, “Father, I give thanks to you that you hear me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>And I know that you always hear me, but for the sake of the crowd standing around I said it, so that they may believe that you sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And when he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>The one who had died came out, his feet and his hands bound with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped with a facecloth. Jesus said to them, “Untie him and let him go.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Then many of the Jews who had come with Mary and saw the things which he did believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>So the chief priests and the Pharisees called together the Sanhedrin and said, “What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we allow him to go on in this way, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But a certain one of them, Caiaphas (who was high priest in that year), said to them, “You do not know anything at all!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>Nor do you consider that it is profitable for you that one man should die for the people, and the whole nation not perish.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>(Now he did not say this from himself, but being high priest in that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for the nation only, but also that the children of God who are scattered would be gathered into one.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>So from that day they resolved that they should kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>So Jesus was no longer walking openly among the Jews, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he stayed with the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the surrounding country before the Passover, so that they could purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>So they were looking for Jesus, and were speaking with one another while standing in the temple courts, “What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>(Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, they should report it, in order that they could arrest him.)</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>So they made him a dinner there, and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of the ones reclining at table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Then Mary took a pound of ointment of very valuable genuine nard and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was going to betray him) said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>“˻Why˼ was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>(Now he said this not because ˻he was concerned˼ about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, he used to steal what was put into it.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>So Jesus said, “Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my preparation for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For you have the poor with you always, but you do not always have me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>Now the large crowd of Jews found out that he was there, and they came, not only because of Jesus, but so that they could see Lazarus also, whom he raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>So the chief priests decided that they would kill Lazarus also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because on account of him many of the Jews were going and believing in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took the branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, and began crying out,“Hosanna!Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord,even the king of Israel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>So Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>“Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion!Behold, your king is coming,seated on the foal of a donkey!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>(His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and they did these things to him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>So the crowd who was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were continuing to testify.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>Because of this also the crowd went to meet him, for they had heard that he had performed this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are accomplishing nothing! Behold, the world has gone after him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now some Greeks were among those who had gone up in order to worship at the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>So these approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and began asking him saying, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip went and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>And Jesus answered them, saying, “The hour has come that the Son of Man will be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Truly, truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>The one who loves his life loses it, and the one who hates his life in this world preserves it for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If anyone serves me, he must follow me, and where I am, there my servant will be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>“Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, deliver me from this hour’? But for this reason I have come to this hour!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify your name!” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have both glorified it, and I will glorify it again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>Now the crowd that stood there and heard it said ˻it had thundered˼. Others were saying, “An angel has spoken to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered and said, “This voice has not happened for my sake, but for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world! Now the ruler of this world will be thrown out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>(Now he said this to indicate by what sort of death he was going to die.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>Then the crowd replied to him, “We have heard from the law that the Christ remains ˻forever˼! And how do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>So Jesus said to them, “Yet a little time the light is with you! Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness does not overtake you! And the one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While you have the light, believe in the light, in order that you may become sons of light.” Jesus said these things, and then he went away and was hidden from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But as many signs as he had performed before them, they did not believe in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>in order that the word of the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said,“Lord, who has believed our message?And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>For this reason they were not able to believe, because again Isaiah said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>“He has blinded their eyesand hardened their hearts,lest they see with their eyesand understand with their heartsand turn, and I heal them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory, and he spoke about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Yet despite that, even many of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>For they loved the praise of men more than praise from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>But Jesus cried out and said, “The one who believes in me does not believe in me, but in the one who sent me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>and the one who sees me sees the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I have come as a light into the world, in order that everyone who believes in me will not remain in the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And if anyone hears my words and does not observe them, I will not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has one who judges him; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not spoken from myself, but the Father himself who sent me ˻has commanded me˼ what I should say and what I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that his commandment is eternal life. So the things that I say, just as the Father said to me, thus I say.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now before the feast of Passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he would depart from this world to the Father, and having loved his own in the world, loved them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>And as a dinner was taking place, when the devil had already put into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot that he should betray him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>because he knew that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he had come forth from God and was going away to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>he got up from the dinner and took off his outer clothing, and taking a towel, tied it around himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>Then he poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them dry with the towel ˻which he had tied around himself˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.7'>Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand after these things.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.8'>Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet ˻forever˼!” Jesus replied to him, “Unless I wash you, you do not have a share with me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.9'>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus said to him, “The one who has bathed ˻only needs˼ to wash his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not all of you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>(For he knew the one who would betray him; because of this he said, “Not all of you are clean.”)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>So when he had washed their feet and taken his outer clothing and reclined at table again, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.13'>You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and you speak correctly, for I am.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.18'>“I am not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen, but in order that the scripture would be fulfilled, ‘The one who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.’</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.21'>When he had said these things, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified and said, “Truly, truly I say to you that one of you will betray me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.22'>The disciples began looking at one another, uncertain about whom he was speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.23'>One of his disciples—the one whom Jesus loved—was reclining ˻close beside˼ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.24'>So Simon Peter gestured for this one to inquire who it was about whom he was speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.25'>Then he leaned back accordingly against Jesus’ chest and said to him, “Lord, who is it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.26'>Jesus replied, “It is he to whom I dip the piece of bread and give it to him.” Then after dipping the piece of bread, he took it and gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.27'>And after the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, “What you are doing, do quickly!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.28'>(Now no one of those reclining at table knew for what reason he said this to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.29'>For some were thinking because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him, “Purchase ˻what we need˼ for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.30'>So after he had taken the piece of bread, he went out immediately. And it was night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.31'>Then, when he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.3'>So Judas, taking the cohort and officers from the chief priests and from the Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.4'>Then Jesus, because he knew all the things that were coming upon him, went out and said to them, “Who are you looking for?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.5'>They replied to him, “Jesus the Nazarene.” He said to them, “I am he.” (Now Judas, the one who betrayed him, was also standing with them.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.6'>So when he said to them, “I am he,” ˻they drew back˼ and fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.7'>Then he asked them again, “Who are you looking for?” And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.8'>Jesus replied, “I said to you that I am he! So if you are looking for me, let these men go,”</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.12'>Then the cohort and the military tribune and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and tied him up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.13'>and brought him to Annas first, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.15'>So Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. (Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.16'>But Peter was standing by the door outside. So the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.19'>So the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.20'>Jesus replied to him, “I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple courts where all the Jews assemble, and I have said nothing in secret.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.27'>So Peter denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.28'>Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s residence. Now it was early, and they did not enter into the governor’s residence so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>So Pilate came outside to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They answered and said to him, “If this man were not doing evil, we would not have handed him over to you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>So Pilate said to them, “You take him and judge him according to your law!” The Jews said to him, “It is not permitted for us to kill anyone,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>in order that the word of Jesus would be fulfilled that he had spoken, indicating by what sort of death he was going to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Then Pilate entered again into the governor’s residence and summoned Jesus and said to him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus replied, “Do you say this from yourself, or have others said this to you about me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate replied, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your people and the chief priests handed you over to me! What have you done?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus replied, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Then Pilate said to him, “So then you are a king!” Jesus replied, “You say that I am a king. For this reason I was born, and for this reason I have come into the world: in order that I can testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate said to him, “What is truth?”And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, “I find no basis for an accusation against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But it is your custom that I release for you one prisoner at the Passover. So do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>Then they shouted again, saying, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” (Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.)</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>So then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>And Pilate came outside again and said to them, “Behold, I am bringing him outside to you, so that you will know that I find no basis for an accusation against him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Then Jesus came outside wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, and he said to them, “Behold the man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>So when they saw him, the chief priests and the officers shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify!” Pilate said to them, “You take him and crucify him! For I do not find a basis for an accusation against him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews replied to him, “We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself out to be the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>So when Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and he entered into the governor’s residence again and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus did not give him an answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>So Pilate said to him, “Will you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I have authority to crucify you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus replied to him, “You would not have any authority over me unless it was given to you from above. For this reason the one who handed me over to you has greater sin.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>From this point on Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews shouted, saying, “If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar! Everyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes Caesar!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>So Pilate, when he heard these words, brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat, in the place called The Stone Pavement (but Gabbatha in Aramaic).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>(Now it was the day of preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, “Behold your king!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>Then those shouted, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your king?” The chief priests replied, “We do not have a king except Caesar!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>So then he handed him over to them in order that he could be crucified.So they took Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>and carrying for himself the cross, he went out to the place called The Place of a Skull (which is called Golgotha in Aramaic),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified him, and with him two others, ˻one on each side˼, and Jesus in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate also wrote a notice and placed it on the cross, and it was written: “Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>So many of the Jews read this notice, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The king of the Jews,’ but, ‘He said, I am king of the Jews.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate replied, “What I have written, I have written.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothing and made four shares—for each soldier a share—and the tunic. (Now the tunic was seamless, woven from the top ˻in a single piece˼.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it apart, but cast lots for it, to see whose it will be,” so that the scripture would be fulfilled that says,“They divided my garments among themselves,and for my clothing they cast lots.”Thus the soldiers did these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Now his mother and the sister of his mother, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene were standing near the cross of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>So Jesus, seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, said to his mother, “Woman, behold your son!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then he said to the disciple, “Behold your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus, knowing that now at last everything was completed, in order that the scripture would be fulfilled, said, “I am thirsty.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>A jar full of sour wine was standing there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a branch of hyssop and brought it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>Then when he had received the sour wine, Jesus said, “It is completed,” and bowing his head, he gave up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was an important day), asked Pilate that their legs could be broken and they could be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But when they came to Jesus, after they saw he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water came out immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And the one who has seen it has testified, and his testimony is true, and that person knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things happened in order that the scripture would be fulfilled: “Not a bone of his will be broken.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another scripture says, “They will look on the one whom they have pierced.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>And after these things, Joseph who was from Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (but a secret one for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate allowed it, so he came and took away his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And Nicodemus—the one who had come to him formerly at night—also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in strips of linen cloth with the fragrant spices, as is the Jews’ custom to prepare for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now there was a garden at the place where he was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one was yet buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>So there, on account of the day of preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was close by, they buried Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw the stone had been taken away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>So she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them, “They have taken away the Lord from the tomb and we do not know where they have put him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Then Peter and the other disciple went out and were going to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>And the two were running together, and the other disciple ran ahead, faster than Peter, and came to the tomb first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>And bending over to look, he saw the strips of linen cloth lying there, though he did not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then Simon Peter also came following him, and he went into the tomb and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the facecloth that was on his head—not lying with the strips of linen cloth, but folded up separately in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>So then the other disciple who had come to the tomb first also went in, and he saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>(For they did not yet know the scripture that it was necessary for him to rise from the dead.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood outside at the tomb, weeping. Then, while she was weeping, she bent over to look into the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>and she saw two angels in white, seated one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>When she had said these things, she turned ˻around˼ and saw Jesus standing there, and she did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” She thought that it was the gardener, and said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned around and said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni” (which means “Teacher”).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus said to her, “Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene came and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and he had said these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>Now when it was evening on that day—the first day of the week—and the doors had been shut where the disciples were because of fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them, “Peace to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And when he had said this, he showed his hands and his side to them. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>So Jesus said to them again, “Peace to you. As the Father has sent me, I also send you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them. If you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>So the other disciples said to him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And after eight days his disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Although the doors had been shut, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said, “Peace to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then he said to Thomas, “Place your finger here and see my hands, and place your hand and put it into my side. And do not be unbelieving, but believing!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas answered and said to him, “My Lord and my God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen me, have you believed? Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>Now Jesus also performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples which are not recorded in this book,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>but these things are recorded in order that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After these things Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. Now he revealed himself in this way:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>Simon Peter and Thomas (who was called Didymus) and Nathanael from Cana in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two others of his disciples were together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing!” They said to him, “We also are coming with you.” They went out and got into the boat, and during that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>Now when it was already early morning, Jesus stood on the beach. However, the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>So Jesus said to them, “Children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you? They answered him, “No.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>And he said to them, “Throw the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they threw it, and were no longer able to haul it in from the large number of the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” So Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, tied around himself his outer garment (for he was naked) and threw himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net of fish, because they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>So when they got out on the land, they saw a charcoal fire laid there, and a fish lying on it, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish that you have just now caught.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net to the land, full of large fish—one hundred fifty-three—and although there were so many, the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus said to them, “Come, eat breakfast!” But none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” because they knew that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he had been raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>Now when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He said to him again a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Shepherd my sheep!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He said to him a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter was distressed because he said to him a third time, “Do you love me?” and he said to him, “Lord, you know everything! You know that I love you!” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Truly, truly I say to you, when you were young, you tied your clothes around yourself and walked wherever you wanted. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will tie you up and carry you where you do not want to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>(Now he said this to indicate by what kind of death he would glorify God.) And after he had said this, he said to him, “Follow me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them (who also leaned back on his chest at the dinner and said, “Lord, who is the one betraying you?”)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>So when he saw this one, Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, but what about this one?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus said to him, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>So this saying went out to the brothers that that disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who is testifying about these things, and who has written down these things. And we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>Now there are also many other things that Jesus did, which—if they were written down one after the other—I suppose not even the world itself could contain the books that would be written.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>I produced the former account, O Theophilus, about all ˻that˼ Jesus began to do and to teach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>until the day he was taken up, after he had given orders through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>to whom he also presented himself alive after he suffered, with many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking the things about the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>And while he was with them, he commanded them, “Do not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for what was promised by the Father, which you heard about from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit ˻not many days from now˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>So when they had come together, they began asking him, saying, “Lord, is it at this time you are restoring the kingdom to Israel?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>But he said to them, “It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has set by his own authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the farthest part of the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>And after he had said these things, while they were watching, he was taken up, and a cloud received him from their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>And as they were staring into the sky while he was departing, behold, two men in white clothing stood by them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>who also said, “Men ˻of Galilee˼, why do you stand there gazing into the sky? This Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven like this will come back in the same way you saw him departing into heaven!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain that is called Olive Grove which is near Jerusalem, ˻a Sabbath day’s journey away˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>And when they had entered, they went up to the upstairs room where they were staying—Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas son of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>All these were busily engaged with one mind in prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers (and it was a crowd of persons of about one hundred twenty at the same place) and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>“Men and brothers, it was necessary that the scripture be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit proclaimed beforehand through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>because he was counted among us and received a share in this ministry.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>(Now this man acquired a field for the wages of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines spilled out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>And it became known to all who live in Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their own language “Akeldama,” that is, “Field of Blood.”)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>“For it is written in the book of Psalms,‘Let his residence become deserted,and let there be no one to live in it,’and,‘Let another person take his position.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>Therefore it is necessary for one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>beginning from the baptism of John until the day on which he was taken up from us—one of these men must become a witness of his resurrection together with us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>And they proposed two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was called Justus) and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>And they prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show clearly which one of these two you have chosen</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to depart to his own place.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>And when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in the same place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>And suddenly a sound like a violent rushing wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>And divided tongues like fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages as the Spirit gave them ability to speak out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>Now there were Jews residing in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>And when this sound occurred, the crowd gathered and was in confusion, because each one was hearing them speaking in his own language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>And they were astounded and astonished, saying, “Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>And how do we hear, each one of us, in ˻our own native language˼?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Parthians and Medes and Elamites and those residing in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs—we hear them speaking in our own languages the great deeds of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>And all were amazed and greatly perplexed, saying ˻to one another˼, “˻What can this mean?˼”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>But others jeered and said, “They are full of sweet new wine!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them, “Judean men, and all those who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and pay attention to my words!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>For these men are not drunk, as you assume, because it is the third hour of the day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>For David says with reference to him,‘I saw the Lord before me ˻continually˼,for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>For this reason my heart was gladand my tongue rejoiced greatly,furthermore also my flesh will live in hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>because you will not abandon my soul in Hades,nor will you permit your Holy One to experience decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>You have made known to me the paths of life;you will fill me with gladness with your presence.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>“Men and brothers, it is possible to speak with confidence to you about the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>Therefore, because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat ˻one of his descendants˼ on his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>by having foreseen this, he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he abandoned in Hades nor did his flesh experience decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>This Jesus God raised up, of which we all are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured out this that you both see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>For David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself says,‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.” ’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>Therefore let all the house of Israel know beyond a doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “What should we do, men and brothers?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all those who are far away, as many as the Lord our God calls to himself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>And with many other words he solemnly urged and exhorted them, saying, “Be saved from this crooked generation!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>So those who accepted his message were baptized, and on that day about three thousand souls were added.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>And they were devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>And fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were being performed by the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>And all who believed were in the same place, and had everything in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>And they began selling their possessions and property, and distributing these things to all, to the degree that anyone had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>And every day, devoting themselves to meeting with one purpose in the temple courts and breaking bread from house to house, they were eating their food with joy and simplicity of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding every day to the total of those who were being saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>And a certain man was being carried who was lame ˻from birth˼. ˻He˼ was placed every day at the gate of the temple called “Beautiful,” so that he could ask for charitable gifts from those who were going into the temple courts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple courts, he began asking to receive alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>And Peter looked intently at him, together with John, and said, “Look at us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>So he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>But Peter said, “Silver and gold ˻I do not possess˼, but what I have, this I give to you—in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, get up and walk!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>And taking hold of him by the right hand, he raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>And leaping up, he stood and began walking around and entered into the temple courts with them, walking and leaping and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>And all the people saw him walking and praising God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>And they recognized him, that he himself was the one who used to sit asking for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with awe and astonishment at what had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>And while he was holding fast to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon’s, utterly astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>And when he saw it, Peter replied to the people, “Men and Israelites, why are you astonished at this? Or why are you staring at us, as if by our own power or godliness we have made him walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and denied in the presence of Pilate, after he had decided to release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>But you denied the Holy and Righteous One and demanded that a man—a murderer—be granted to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>And you killed the originator of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>And on the basis of faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know, and the faith that is through him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>But the things which God foretold through the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he has fulfilled in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Therefore repent and turn back, so that your sins may be blotted out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and he may send the Christ appointed for you—Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>whom heaven must receive until the times of the restoration of all things, about which God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from earliest times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You will listen to him in everything that he says to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>And it will be that every soul who—if he does not listen to that prophet—will be destroyed utterly from the people.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>And indeed, all the prophets from Samuel and all those who followed him have spoken about and proclaimed these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God ordained with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>God, after he had raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning each of you back from your wickedness!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>And while they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees approached them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>And they laid hands on them and put them in custody until the next day, because it was already evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>But many of those who listened to the message believed, and the number of the men was approximately five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>And it happened that on the next day, their rulers and elders and scribes came together in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all those who were from the high priest’s family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>And they made them stand in their midst and began to ask, “By what power or by what name did you do this?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a sick man—by what means this man was healed—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead—by him this man stands before you healthy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>This one is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, that has become ˻the cornerstone˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven that is given among people by which we must be saved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were astonished, and recognized them, that they had been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>And because they saw the man who had been healed standing there with them, they had nothing to say in return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>But after they had ordered them to go outside the Sanhedrin, they began to confer with one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>saying, “What should we do with these men? For that a remarkable sign has taken place through them is evident to all those who live in Jerusalem, and we are not able to deny it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>But in order that it may not spread much further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more in this name ˻to anyone at all˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>And they called them backand commanded them not to speak or to teach at all in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than God, you decide!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>For we are not able to refrain from speaking about the things that we have seen and heard.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>So after threatening them further, they released them, finding no way to punish them on account of the people, because they were all praising God for what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>For the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>And when they were released, they went to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>And when they heard it, they lifted their voices with one mind to God and said, “Master, you are the one who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>the one who said by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of our father David, your servant,‘Why do the nations rage,and the peoples conspire in vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings of the earth stood opposed,and the rulers assembled together at the same place,against the Lord and against his Christ.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>For in truth both Herod and Pontius Pilate, together with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, assembled together in this city against your holy servant Jesus whom you anointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>to do all that your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>And now, Lord, concern yourself with their threats and grant your slaves to speak your message with all boldness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.30'>as you extend your hand to heal and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>Now the group of those who believed were one heart and soul, and no one said anything of what belonged to him was his own, but all things were theirs in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was on them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>For there was not even anyone needy among them, because all those who were owners of plots of land or houses were selling themand bringing the proceeds of the things that were sold</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.35'>and placing them at the feet of the apostles. And it was being distributed to each as anyone had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>So Joseph, who was called Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated “son of encouragement”), a Levite of Cyprus by nationality,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.37'>sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and placed it at the feet of the apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>Now a certain man ˻named˼ Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.2'>and he kept back for himself some of the proceeds, and his wife was aware of it. And he brought a certain part and placed it at the feet of the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>But Peter said, “Ananias, for what reason has Satan filled your heart, that you lied to the Holy Spirit and kept back for yourself some of the proceeds of the piece of land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>When it remained to you, did it not remain yours? And when it was sold, was it at your disposal? How is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to people, but to God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.5'>And when Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear came on all those who heard about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.6'>So the young men stood up, wrapped him up, and carried him out and buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.7'>And it happened that there was an interval of about three hours, and his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.8'>And Peter said to her, “Tell me whether you both were paid this much for the piece of land.” And she said, “Yes, this much.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.9'>So Peter said to her, “How is it that it was agreed by you two to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.10'>And immediately she fell down at his feet and died. So when the young men came in, they found her dead, and carried her out and buried her with her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>And great fear came on the whole church and on all who heard about these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>Now many signs and wonders were being performed among the people through the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon’s Portico.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.13'>And none of the rest dared to join them, but the people spoke highly of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>And even more believers in the Lord were being added, large numbers of both men and women,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and put them on cots and mats so that when Peter came by, at least his shadow would fall on some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.16'>And the people of the towns around Jerusalem also came together, bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits, who were all being healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.17'>Now the high priest rose up and all those who were with him (that is, the party of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.18'>And they laid hands on the apostles and put them in the public prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.19'>But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison and led them outand said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.20'>“Go and stand in the temple courtsand proclaim to the people all the words of this life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>And when they heard this, they entered at daybreak into the temple courts and began teaching.Now when the high priest and those with him arrived, they summoned the Sanhedrin—even the whole council of elders of the sons of Israel—and sent to the prison to have them brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.22'>But the officers who came did not find them in the prison, and they returned and reported,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>saying, “We found the prison locked with all security and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>Now when both the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed concerning them, as to what this might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>But someone came and reported to them, “Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple courts and teaching the people!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>Then the captain went with the officers and brought them, not with force (for they were afraid of the people, lest they be stoned by them).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.27'>And when they had brought them, they made them stand in the Sanhedrin, and the high priest put a question to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.28'>saying, “Did we not ˻strictly command˼ you not to teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching! And you are intending to bring upon us the blood of this man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>But Peter and the apostles answered and said, “It is necessary to obey God rather than men!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.31'>This one God has exalted to his right hand as Leader and Savior to grant repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.32'>And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.33'>Now when they heard this, they were infuriated, and were wanting to execute them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>But a certain man stood up in the Sanhedrin, a Pharisee ˻named˼ Gamaliel, a teacher of the law respected by all the people, and gave orders to put the men outside for a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.35'>And he said to them, “Men and Israelites, take care for yourselves what you are about to do to these men!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>For before these days, Theudas rose up saying he was somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined ˻him˼. ˻He˼ was executed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.37'>After this man, Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and ˻caused people to follow him in revolt˼. And that one perished, and all who followed him were scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.38'>And now I tell you, keep away from these men, and leave them alone, because if this plan or this matter is from people, it will be overthrown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.39'>But if it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them, lest you even be found fighting against God.” So they were persuaded by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.40'>And they summoned the apostles, beat them, commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and released them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.41'>So they went out from the presence of the Sanhedrin rejoicing, because they had been considered worthy to be dishonored for the sake of the name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.42'>Every day, both in the temple courts and from house to house, they did not stop teaching and proclaiming the good news that the Christ was Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.6'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.1'>Now in these days, as the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint arose by the ˻Greek-speaking Jews˼ against the ˻Hebraic Jews˼ because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.2'>So the twelve summoned the community of disciples and said, “It is not desirable that we neglect the word of God to serve tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.3'>So, brothers, select from among you seven men ˻of good reputation˼, full of the Spirit and wisdom, whom we will put in charge of this need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.4'>But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.5'>And the statement pleased the whole group, and they chose Stephen (a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit), and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus (a convert from Antioch),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.6'>whom they stood before the apostles. And they prayed and placed their hands on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.7'>And the word of God kept spreading, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem was increasing greatly, and a large number of priests began obeying the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.8'>Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.9'>But some of those from the Synagogue of the Freedmen (˻as it was called˼), both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia, stood up and disputed with Stephen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.10'>And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.11'>Then they secretly instigated men who said, “We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.12'>And they incited the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came up and seized him and brought him to the Sanhedrin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.13'>And they put forward false witnesses who said, “This man does not stop speaking words against this holy place and the law!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.14'>For we have heard him saying that this Nazarene Jesus will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses handed down to us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.15'>And as they looked intently at him, all those who were sitting in the Sanhedrin saw his face was like the face of an angel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.7'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.1'>And the high priest said, “Is it so concerning these things?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.2'>So he said, “Men—brothers and fathers—listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.3'>and said to him, ‘Go out from your land and from your relatives and come to the land that I will show you.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.4'>Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. And from there, after his father died, he caused him to move to this land in which you now live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.5'>And he did not give him an inheritance in it—not even a footstep—and he promised to give it to him for his possession, and to his descendants after him, ˻although he did not have˼ a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.6'>But God spoke like this: ‘His descendants will be foreigners in a foreign land, and they will enslave them and mistreat them four hundred years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.7'>and the nation ˻that˼ they will serve as slaves, I will judge,’ God said, ‘and after these things they will come out and will worship me in this place.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.8'>And he gave him the covenant of circumcision, and so he became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac did so with Jacob, and Jacob did so with the twelve patriarchs.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.7.58'>And after they had driven him out of the city, they began to stone him, and the witnesses laid aside their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.8'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.1'>And Saul was agreeing with his murder. Now there happened on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.2'>And devout men buried Stephen and made loud lamentation over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.3'>But Saul was attempting to destroy the church. Entering ˻house after house˼, he dragged off both men and women and delivered them to prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.4'>Now those who had been scattered went about proclaiming the good news of the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.5'>And Philip came down to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming the Christ to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.6'>And the crowds with one mind were paying attention to what was being said by Philip, as they heard him and saw the signs that he was performing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.7'>For many of those who had unclean spirits, they were coming out of them, crying out with a loud voice, and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.8'>And there was great joy in that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.9'>Now a certain man ˻named˼ Simon had been in the city practicing magic and astonishing the people of Samaria, saying he was someone great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.10'>They were all paying attention to ˻him˼, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is the power of God that is called ‘Great.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.11'>And they were paying attention to him because for a long time he had astonished them with his magic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.12'>But when they believed Philip as he was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were being baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.13'>And Simon himself also believed, and after he was baptized he was ˻keeping close company with˼ Philip. And when he saw the signs and great miracles that were taking place, he was astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.14'>Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.15'>who went down and prayed for them so that they would receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.16'>(For he had not yet fallen on any of them, ˻but they had only been baptized˼ in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.17'>Then they placed their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.18'>Now Simon, when he saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, offered them money,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.19'>saying, “Give to me also this power, so that whomever I place my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.20'>But Peter said to him, “May your silver ˻be destroyed along with you˼, because you thought ˻you could acquire˼ the gift of God by means of money!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.21'>˻You have no˼ part or share in this matter, because your heart is not right before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.22'>Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and ask the Lord if perhaps the intent of your heart may be forgiven you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.23'>For I see you are in ˻a state of bitter envy˼ and ˻bound by unrighteousness˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.24'>But Simon answered and said, “You pray to the Lord for me so that nothing of what you have said will come upon me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.25'>So when they had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they turned back toward Jerusalem, and were proclaiming the good news to many villages of the Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.26'>Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, “Get up and go toward the south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a desert road.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.27'>And he got up and went, and behold, there was a man, an Ethiopian eunuch (a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasury) who had come to worship in Jerusalem</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.28'>and was returning and sitting in his chariot, and reading aloud the prophet Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.29'>And the Spirit said to Philip, “Approach and join this chariot.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.30'>So Philip ran up to itand heard him reading aloud Isaiah the prophet and said, “So then, do you understand what you are reading?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.31'>And he said, “So how could I, unless someone will guide me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.32'>Now the passage of scripture that he was reading aloud was this:“He was led like a sheep to the slaughter,and like a lamb before its shearer is silent,so he did not open his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.33'>In his humiliation justice was taken from him.Who can describe his ˻descendants˼?For his life was taken away from the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.34'>And the eunuch answered and said to Philip, “I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this—about himself or about someone else?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.35'>So Philip opened his mouth and beginning from this scripture, proclaimed the good news to him about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.36'>And as they were traveling down the road, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.38'>And he ordered the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water—Philip and the eunuch—and he baptized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.39'>And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him any longer, for he went on his way rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.40'>But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through, he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.9'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.1'>But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.2'>and asked for letters from him to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, both men and women, he could bring them tied up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.3'>Now as he proceeded, it happened that when he approached Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.4'>And falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.5'>So he said, “Who are you, Lord?” And he said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.6'>But get up and enter into the city, and it will be told to you ˻what you must do˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.7'>(Now the men who were traveling together with him stood speechless, because they heard the voice but saw no one.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>So Saul got up from the ground, but although his eyes were open he could see nothing. And leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>And he was ˻unable to see˼for three days, and he did not eat or drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus ˻named˼ Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias!” And he said, “Behold, here I am, Lord!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>And the Lord said to him, “Get up, go to the street called ‘Straight’ and in the house of Judas look for ˻a man named Saul from Tarsus˼. For behold, he is praying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>and he has seen in a vision a man ˻named˼ Ananias coming in and placing his hands on him so that he may regain his sight.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>But Ananias replied, “Lord, I have heard from many people about this man, how much harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>and here he has authority from the chief priests to tie up all who call upon your name!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>But the Lord said to him, “Go, because this man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>So Ananias departed and entered into the house, and placing his hands on him, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight and got up and was baptized,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>and after taking food, he regained his strength. And he was with the disciples in Damascus several days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>And immediately he began proclaiming Jesus in the synagogues: “This one is the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>And all who heard him were amazed, and were saying, “Is this not the one who was wreaking havoc in Jerusalem on those who call upon this name, and had come here for this reason, that he could bring them tied up to the chief priests?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>But Saul was increasing in strength even more, and was confounding the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that this one is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>And when many days had elapsed, the Jews plotted to do away with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>But their plot became known to Saul, and they were also watching the gates both day and night so that they could do away with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>But his disciples took him at night and let him down through the wall by lowering him in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>And when he arrived in Jerusalem, he was attempting to associate with the disciples, and they were all afraid of him, because they did not believe that he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road and that he had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.28'>And he was going in and going out among them in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>And he was speaking and debating with the ˻Greek-speaking Jews˼, but they were trying to do away with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.30'>And when the brothers found out, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>Then the church throughout all of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being strengthened. And living in the fear of the Lord and the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, it was increasing in numbers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>Now it happened that as Peter was traveling through all the places, he also came down to the saints who lived in Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>And he found there a certain man ˻named˼ Aeneas who was paralyzed, who had been lying on a mat for eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>And Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you! Get up and make your bed yourself!” And immediately he got up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>And all those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him, who all indeed turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>Now in Joppa there was a certain female disciple ˻named˼ Tabitha (which translated means “Dorcas”). She was full of good deeds and charitable giving which she was constantly doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.37'>Now it happened that in those days after becoming sick, she died. And after washing her, they placed her in an upstairs room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>And because Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, when they heard that Peter was in ˻Lydda˼, sent two men to him, urging, “Do not delay to come to us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>So Peter got up and accompanied them. When he arrived, they brought him up to the upstairs room, and all the widows came to him, weeping and showing him tunics and other clothing that Dorcas used to make while she was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>But Peter sent them all outside, and, falling to his knees, he prayed. And turning toward the body, he said, “Tabitha, get up!” And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>And he gave her his hand and raised her up. And he called the saints and the widows and presented her alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.43'>And it happened that he stayed many days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>Now there was a certain man in Caesarea ˻named˼ Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Cohort,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>devout and fearing God together with all his household, doing many charitable deeds for the people and praying to God ˻continually˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>About the ninth hour of the day, he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, “Cornelius.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>And he stared at him and became terrified and said, “What is it, Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and your charitable deeds have gone up for a memorial offering before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>And now, send men to Joppa and summon a certain Simon, who is also called Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>This man is staying as a guest with a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>And when the angel who spoke to him departed, he summoned two of the household slaves and a devout soldier from those who attended him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>And the next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>And he became hungry and wanted to eat. But while they were preparing the food, a trance came over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>And he saw heaven opened and an object something like a large sheet coming down, being let down to the earth by its four corners,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>in which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>And a voice came to him, “Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>But Peter said, “Certainly not, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common and unclean!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>And the voice came again to him for the second time: “The things which God has made clean, you must not consider unclean!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>And this happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>Now while Peter was greatly perplexed within himself as to what the vision that he had seen might be, behold, the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having found the house of Simon by asking around, stood at the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>And they called out and asked if Simon who was also called Peter was staying there as a guest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>And while Peter was reflecting about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are looking for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>But get up, go down, and go with them—not hesitating at all, because I have sent them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>So Peter went down to the men and said, “Behold, I am he whom you are looking for! What is the reason for which you have come?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>And they said, “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man—and well spoken of by the whole nation of the Jews—was directed by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear words from you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>So he invited them in and entertained them as guests, and on the next day he got up and went away with them. And some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>And on the next day he entered into Caesarea.Now Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his relatives and close friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>So it happened that when Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet, and worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>But Peter helped him up, saying, “Get up! I myself am also a man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>And as he conversed with him, he went in and found many people gathered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>And he said to them, “You know that it is forbidden for a Jewish man to associate with or to approach a foreigner. And to me God has shown that I should call no man common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>Therefore—and without raising any objection—I came when I was sent for. So I ask for what reason you sent for me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>And Cornelius said, “˻Four days ago at this hour˼, the ninth, I was praying in my house. And behold, a man in shining clothing stood before me</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your charitable deeds have been remembered before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>Therefore send to Joppa and summon Simon who is also called Peter. This man is staying as a guest in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>Therefore I sent for you at once, and you ˻were kind enough to come˼. So now we all are present before God to hear all the things that have been commanded to you by the Lord.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>So Peter opened his mouth and said, “In truth I understand that God is not one who shows partiality,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>but in every nation the one who fears him and who does what is right is acceptable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>As for the message that he sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming the good news of peace through Jesus Christ—this one is Lord of all—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>you know the thing that happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism that John proclaimed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>Jesus of Nazareth—how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>And we are witnesses of all the things that he did both in the land of the Judeans and in Jerusalem, whom they also executed by hanging him on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>God raised this one up on the third day and granted that he should become visible,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>not to all the people but to us who had been chosen beforehand by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify solemnly that this one is the one appointed by God as judge of the living and of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>To this one all the prophets testify, that through his name everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who were listening to the message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>And those believers from the circumcision who had accompanied Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>for they heard them speaking in tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>“Surely no one can withhold the water for these people to be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also did!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for several days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had accepted the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision took issue with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>saying, “You went to men ˻who were uncircumcised˼ and ate with them!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>But Peter began and explained it to them in an orderly sequence, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision—an object something like a large sheet coming down, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>As I looked intently into it, I was considering it, and I saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild animals and the reptiles and the birds of the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>And I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>But I said, ‘Certainly not, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has ever entered into my mouth!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>But the voice replied from heaven for the second time, ‘The things which God has made clean, you must not consider unclean!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>And this happened three times, and everything was pulled up into heaven again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>And behold, at once three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea approached the house in which we were staying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>And the Spirit told me to accompany them, not hesitating at all. So these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the man’s house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>And he reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is also called Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.14'>who will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>And as I was beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as also on us at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>Therefore if God gave them the same gift as also to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to be able to hinder God?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>And when they heard these things, they became silent and praised God, saying, “Then God has granted the repentance leading to life to the Gentiles also!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, proclaiming the message to no one except Jews alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they came to Antioch, began to speak to the Hellenists also, proclaiming the good news about the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>˻And the report came to the attention˼ of the church that was in Jerusalem about them, and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>who, when he arrived and saw the grace of God, rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with ˻devoted hearts˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>because he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a large number were added to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>So he departed for Tarsus to look for Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>And when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it happened to them also that they met together for a whole year with the church and taught a large number of people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>Now in those days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>And one of them ˻named˼ Agabus stood up and indicated by the Spirit that a great famine was about to come over the whole inhabited earth (which took place in the time of Claudius).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>So from the disciples, ˻according to their ability to give˼, each one of them determined to send financial aid for support to the brothers who lived in Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.30'>which they also did, sending the aid to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.12'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.1'>Now at that time, Herod the king laid hands on some of those from the church to harm them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>So he executed James the brother of John with a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>And when he saw that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. (˻Now this was during the feast˼ of Unleavened Bread.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>After he had arrested ˻him˼, he also put him in prison, handing him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him ˻out for public trial˼ after the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>Thus Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer was fervently being made to God by the church for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards before the door were watching the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood near him, and a light shone in the prison cell. And striking Peter’s side, he woke him up, saying, “Get up ˻quickly˼!” And his chains fell off of his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>And the angel said to him, “Gird yourself and put on your sandals!” And he did so. And he said to him, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>And he went out and was following him. And he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but was thinking he was seeing a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>And after they had passed the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened for them by itself, and they went out and went forward along one narrow street, and at once the angel departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>And when Peter came to himself, he said, “Now I know truly that the Lord has sent out his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and all ˻that the Jewish people expected˼!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>And when he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John (who is also called Mark), where many people were gathered together and were praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a female slave ˻named˼ Rhoda came up to answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>And recognizing Peter’s voice, because of her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing at the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>But they said to her, “You are out of your mind!” But she kept insisting it was so. And they kept saying, “It is his angel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>But Peter was continuing to knock, and when they opened the door they saw him and were astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he related to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, “Report these things to James and to the brothers,” and he departed and went to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>Now when day came, there was not a little commotion among the soldiers as to what then had become of Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>And when Herod had searched for him and did not find him, he questioned the guards and ordered that they be led away to execution. And he came down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>Now he was very angry with the Tyrians and Sidonians. So they came to him with one purpose, and after persuading Blastus, ˻the king’s chamberlain˼, they asked for peace, because their country was supported with food from the king’s country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>So on an appointed day Herod, after putting on royal clothing and sitting down on the judgment seat, began to deliver a public address to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>But the people began to call out loudly, “The voice of a god and not of a man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.23'>And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down ˻because˼ he did not give the glory to God. And he was eaten by worms and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.24'>But the word of God kept on increasing and multiplying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.25'>So Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem when they had completed their service, having taken along with them John (who is also called Mark).</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.13'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.1'>Now there were prophets and teachers in Antioch in the church that was there: Barnabas, and Simeon (who was called Niger), and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen (a close friend of Herod the tetrarch), and Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.2'>And while they were serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart now for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.3'>Then, after they had fasted and prayed and placed their hands on them, they sent them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.4'>Therefore, sent out by the Holy Spirit, they came down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed away to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.5'>And when they came to Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they also had John as assistant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.6'>And when they had crossed over the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain man, a magician, a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.7'>who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and wished to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.8'>But Elymas the magician (for his name is translated in this way) opposed them, attempting to turn the proconsul away from the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.9'>But Saul (also called Paul), filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.10'>and said, “O you who are full of all deceit and of all unscrupulousness, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness! Will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.11'>And now behold, the hand of the Lord is against you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun ˻for a while˼. And immediately mist and darkness fell over him, and he was going around looking for people to lead him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.12'>Then when the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, because he was astounded at the teaching about the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.13'>Now ˻Paul and his companions˼ put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia, but John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.14'>And they went on from Perga and arrived at Pisidian Antioch. And they entered into the synagogue on the day of the Sabbath and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.15'>So after the reading from the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, “Men and brothers, if there is any message of exhortation by you for the people, say it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.16'>So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand, he said, “Israelite men, and those who fear God, listen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.17'>The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.18'>And for a period of time of about forty years, he put up with them in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.19'>And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave their land to his people as an inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.20'>This took about four hundred and fifty years. And after these things, he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.21'>And then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man from the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.22'>And after removing him, he raised up David for their king, about whom he also said, testifying, ‘I have found David the son of Jesse to be a man in accordance with my heart, who will carry out all my will.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.23'>From the descendants of this man, according to his promise, God brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.24'>Before ˻his coming˼ John had publicly proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.25'>But while John was completing his mission, he said, ‘What do you suppose me to be? I am not he! But behold, one is coming after me of whom I am not worthy to untie the sandals of his feet!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.26'>“Men and brothers, sons of the family of Abraham and those among you who fear God—to us the message of this salvation has been sent!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.27'>For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize this one, and the voices of the prophets that are read on every Sabbath, fulfilled themby condemning him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.29'>And when they had carried out all the things that were written about him, they took him down from the tree and placed him in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.30'>But God raised him from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.31'>who appeared for many days to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem—who are now his witnesses to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.32'>And we proclaim the good news to you: that the promise that was made to the fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.33'>this promise God has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as it is also written in the second psalm,‘You are my Son;today I have fathered you.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.34'>But that he has raised him from the dead, no more going to return to decay, he has spoken in this way: ‘I will give you the reliable divine decrees of David.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.35'>Therefore he also says in another psalm,‘You will not permit your Holy One to experience decay.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.36'>For David, after serving the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and ˻was buried with˼ his fathers, and experienced decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.37'>But he whom God raised up did not experience decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.38'>“Therefore let it be known to you, men and brothers, that through this one forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.40'>Watch out, therefore, lest what is stated by the prophets come upon you:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.42'>And as they were going out, they began urging that these things be spoken about to them on the next Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.43'>And after the synagogue had broken up, many of the Jews and the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who were speaking to them and were persuading them to continue in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.44'>And on the coming Sabbath, nearly the whole city came together to hear the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.45'>But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy, and began contradicting what was being said by Paul by reviling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.46'>Both Paul and Barnabas spoke boldly and said, “It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you, since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life! Behold, we are turning to the Gentiles!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.47'>For so the Lord has commanded us:‘I have appointed you ˻to be˼ a light for the Gentiles,˻that you would bring˼ salvation to the end of the earth.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.48'>And when the Gentiles heard this, they began to rejoice and to glorify the word of the Lord. And all those who were designated for eternal life believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.49'>So the word of the Lord was carried through the whole region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.50'>But the Jews incited the devout women of high social standing and the most prominent men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and threw them out of their district.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.51'>So after shaking off the dust from their feet against them, they went to Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.52'>And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.7'>And there they were continuing to proclaim the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.8'>And in Lystra a certain man was sitting powerless in his feet, lame from ˻birth˼, who had never walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.9'>This man listened while Paul was speaking. ˻Paul˼, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.10'>said with a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet!” And he leaped up and began walking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices in the Lycaonian language, saying, “The gods have become like men and have come down to us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.12'>And they began calling Barnabas Zeus and Paul Hermes, because he was the ˻principal speaker˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.13'>And the priest of the temple of Zeus that was just outside the city brought bulls and garlands to the gates and was wanting to offer sacrifice, along with the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.14'>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard about it, they tore their clothing and rushed out into the crowd, shouting</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.15'>and saying, “Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men with the same nature as you, proclaiming the good news that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things that are in them—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.16'>who in generations that are past permitted all the nations to go their own ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.17'>And yet he did not leave himself without witness by doing good, giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying you with food and your hearts with gladness.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.18'>And although they said these things, only with difficulty did they dissuade the crowds from offering sacrifice to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.19'>But Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium, and when they had won over the crowds and stoned Paul, they dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.20'>But after the disciples surrounded him, he got up and went into the city. And on the next day he departed with Barnabas for Derbe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.21'>And after they had proclaimed the good news in that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.22'>strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith and saying, “Through many persecutions it is necessary for us to enter into the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.23'>And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, after praying with fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord, in whom they had believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.24'>And they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.25'>And after they proclaimed the message in Perga, they went down to Attalia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.26'>and from there they sailed away to Antioch where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.27'>And when they arrived and called the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.28'>And they stayed no little time with the disciples.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.15'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.1'>And some men came down from Judea and began teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom prescribed by Moses, you cannot be saved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.2'>And after there was no little strife and debate by Paul and Barnabas against them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas and some others from among them to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this issue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.3'>So they were sent on their way by the church, and passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, telling in detail the conversion of the Gentiles and bringing great joy to all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.4'>And when they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and reported all that God had done with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.5'>But some of those who had believed from the party of the Pharisees stood up, saying, “It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to observe the law of Moses!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.6'>Both the apostles and the elders assembled to deliberate concerning this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>And after there was much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Men and brothers, you know that in the early days God chose among you through my mouth that the Gentiles should hear the message of the gospel and believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.8'>And God, who knows the heart, testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he also did to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.9'>And he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.10'>So now why are you putting God to the test by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.11'>But we believe we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus in ˻the same˼ way those also are.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.12'>And the whole group became silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul describing all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.13'>And after they had stopped speaking, James answered, saying, “Men and brothers, listen to me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.14'>Simeon has described how God first concerned himself to take from among the Gentiles a people for his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.15'>And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.16'>‘After these things I will returnand build up again the tent of David that has fallen,and the parts of it that had been torn down I will build up againand will restore it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.17'>so that the rest of humanity may seek the Lord,even all the Gentiles ˻who are called by my name˼,says the Lord, who makes these things</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.18'>known from of old.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.19'>Therefore I conclude we should not cause difficulty for those from among the Gentiles who turn to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.20'>but we should write a letter to them to abstain from the pollution of idols and from sexual immorality and from what has been strangled and from blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.21'>For Moses has those who proclaim him in every city from ancient generations, because he is read aloud in the synagogues on every Sabbath.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.22'>Then it seemed best to the apostles and the elders, together with the whole church, to send men chosen from among them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas—Judas who was called Barsabbas and Silas, men who were leaders among the brothers—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.23'>writing this letter˻to be delivered by them˼:"The apostles and the elders, brothers.To the brothers who are from among the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.Greetings!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.24'>Because we have heard that some have gone out from among us—to whom we gave no orders—and have thrown you into confusion by words upsetting your ˻minds˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.25'>it seemed best to us, ˻having reached a unanimous decision˼, and having chosen men, to send them to you together with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.26'>men who have risked their lives on behalf of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, and they will report the same things by word of mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.28'>For it seemed best to the Holy Spirit and to us to place on you no greater burden except these necessary things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.29'>that you abstain from food sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from ˻these things˼ you will do well.Farewell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.30'>"So when they were sent off, they came down to Antioch, and after calling together the community, they delivered the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.31'>And when they read it aloud, they rejoiced at the encouragement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.32'>Both Judas and Silas, who were also prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brothers by a long message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.33'>And after spending some time, they were sent away in peace from the brothers to those who had sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.35'>But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch teaching and proclaiming the word of the Lord with many others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.36'>And after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, “Come then,let us return and visit the brothers in every town in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.37'>Now Barnabas wanted to take John who was called Mark along also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.38'>but Paul held the opinion they should not take this one along, who departed from them in Pamphylia and did not accompany them in the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.39'>And a sharp disagreement took place, so that they separated from one another. And Barnabas took along Mark and sailed away to Cyprus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.40'>but Paul chose Silas and departed, after being commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.41'>And he traveled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple was there ˻named˼ Timothy, the son of a believing Jewish woman but of a Greek father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.2'>who was well spoken of by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Paul wanted this one to go with him, and he took himand circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>And as they went through the towns, they passed on to them to observe the rules that had been decided by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.5'>So the churches were being strengthened in the faith and were growing in number every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.6'>And they traveled through the Phrygian and Galatian region, having been prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the message in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.7'>And when they came to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>So going through Mysia, they went down to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>And a vision appeared to Paul during the night: a certain Macedonian man was standing there and imploring him and saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.10'>And when he had seen the vision, we wanted at once to go away to Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to proclaim the good news to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.11'>So putting out to sea from Troas, we sailed a straight course to Samothrace, and on the following day to Neapolis,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.12'>and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of that district of Macedonia, a Roman colony. And we were staying in this city for some days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>And on the day of the Sabbath, we went outside the city gate beside the river, where we thought there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women assembled there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>And a certain woman ˻named˼ Lydia from the city of Thyatira, a merchant dealing in purple cloth who showed reverence for God, was listening. The Lord opened ˻her˼ heart to pay attention to what was being said by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>And after she was baptized, and her household, she urged us, saying, “If you consider me to be a believer in the Lord, come to my house and stay.” And she prevailed upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>And it happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a certain female slave who had a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing a large profit to her owners by fortune-telling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>She followed Paul and us and was crying out, saying, “These men are slaves of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>And she was doing this for many days. But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed and turning around, said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out ˻immediately˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>But when her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>And when they had brought them to the chief magistrates, they said, “These men are throwing our city into confusion, being Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>and are proclaiming customs that are not permitted for us to accept or to practice, because we are Romans!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>And the crowd joined in attacking them, and the chief magistrates tore off their clothing and gave orders to beat them with rods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>And after they had inflicted many blows on them, they threw them into prison, giving orders to the jailer to guard them securely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>Having received such an order, ˻he˼ put them in the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>Now about midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened and all the bonds were unfastened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>And after the jailer was awake and saw the doors of the prison open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, because he thought the prisoners had escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.28'>But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, “Do no harm to yourself, for we are all here!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>And demanding lights, he rushed in and, ˻beginning to tremble˼, fell down at the feet of Paul and Silas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>And he brought them outside and said, “Sirs, what must I do so that I can be saved?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>And they spoke the message of the Lord to him, together with all those in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>And he took them at that very hour of the night and washed their wounds, and he himself was baptized at once, and all those of his household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>And he brought them up into his house and set a meal before them, and rejoiced greatly that he had believed in God with his whole household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>And when it was day, the chief magistrates sent the police officers, saying, “Release those men.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>And the jailer reported these words to Paul: “The chief magistrates have sent an order that you should be released. So come out now and go in peace!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But Paul said to them, “They beat us in public without due process—men who are Roman citizens—and threw us into prison, and now they are wanting to release us secretly? Certainly not! Rather let them come themselves and bring us out!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>So the police officers reported these words to the chief magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>And they came and apologized to them, and after they brought them out they asked them to depart from the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>And when they came out of the prison, they went to Lydia and when they saw them, they encouraged the brothers and departed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>Now after they traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>˻And as was his custom˼, Paul went in to them and on three Sabbath days he discussed with them from the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>explaining and demonstrating that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, “This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, and also a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few of the prominent women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But the Jews were filled with jealousy and, taking along some worthless men from the rabble in the marketplace and forming a mob, threw the city into an uproar. And attacking Jason’s house, they were looking for them to bring them out to the popular assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>And when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brothers before the city officials, shouting, “These people who have stirred up trouble throughout the world have come here also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>whom Jason has entertained as guests! And these peopleare all acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king, Jesus!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>And they threw the crowd into confusion, and the city officials who heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>And after taking money as security from Jason and the rest, they released them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>Now the brothers sent away both Paul and Silas at once, during the night, to Berea. ˻They˼ went into the synagogue of the Jews when they arrived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>Now these were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica. ˻They˼ accepted the message with all eagerness, examining the scriptures every day to see if these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>Therefore many of them believed, and not a few of the prominent Greek women and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>But when the Jews from Thessalonica found out that the message of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there too, inciting and stirring up the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>So then the brothers sent Paul away at once to go to the sea, and both Silas and Timothy remained there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>And those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving an order for Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as soon as possible, they went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he observed the city was full of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>So he was discussing in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>And even some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him, and some were saying, “What does this babbler want to say?” But others said, “He appears to be a proclaimer of foreign deities,” because he was proclaiming the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>And they took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we learn what is this new teaching being proclaimed by you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>For you are bringing some astonishing things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what ˻these things mean˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>(Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who stayed there used to spend their time in nothing else than telling something or listening to something new.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>So Paul stood there in the middle of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I see you are very religious ˻in every respect˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>For as I was passing through and observeing carefully your objects of worship, I even found an altar on which was inscribed, ‘To an unknown God.’ Therefore what you worship without knowing it, this I proclaim to you—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>the God who made the world and all the things in it. This one, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by human hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>nor is he served by human hands as if he needed anything, because he himself gives to everyone life and breath and everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>And he made from one man every nation of humanity to live on all the face of the earth, determining their fixed times and the fixed boundaries of their habitation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>to search for God, if perhaps indeed they might feel around for him and find him. And indeed he is not far away from each one of us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>for in him we live and move and exist, as even some of ˻your own˼ poets have said: ‘For we also are ˻his˼ offspring.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>Therefore, because we are offspring of God, we ought not to think the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by human skill and thought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>Therefore although God has overlooked the times of ignorance, he now commands all people everywhere to repent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>because he has set a day on which he is going to judge the world in righteousness by the man who he has appointed, having provided proof to everyone by raising him from the dead.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>Now when they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some scoffed, but others said, “We will hear you about this again also.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>So Paul went out from the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>But some people joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman ˻named˼ Damaris and others with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>After these things he departed from Athens and went to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>And he found a certain Jew ˻named˼ Aquila, ˻a native˼ of Pontus who had arrived recently from Italy ˻along with˼ Priscilla his wife, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to depart from Rome, and he went to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>And because he was practicing the same trade, he stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>And he argued in the synagogue every Sabbath, attempting to persuade both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>Now when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul began to be occupied with the message, solemnly testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>And when they resisted and reviled him, he shook out his clothes and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am guiltless! From now on I will go to the Gentiles!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>And leaving there, he entered into the house of someone ˻named˼ Titius Justus, a worshiper of God whose house was next door to the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord together with his whole household. And many of the Corinthians, when they heard about it, believed and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>And the Lord said to Paul by a vision in the night, “Do not be afraid, but speak and do not keep silent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>because I am with you and no one will attack you to harm you, because many people are mine in this city.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>So he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>Now when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up with one purpose against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>saying, “This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to the law!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it was some crime or wicked villainy, O Jews, ˻I would have been justified in accepting˼ your complaint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>But if it is questions concerning a word and names and ˻your own law˼, see to it yourselves! I do not wish to be a judge of these things.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>And he drove them away from the judgment seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>So they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and began beating him in front of the judgment seat. And none of these things was a concern to Gallio.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>So Paul, after remaining many days longer, said farewell to the brothers and sailed away to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head at Cenchrea, because he had taken a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>So they arrived at Ephesus, and those he left behind there, but he himself entered into the synagogue and discussed with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>And when they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did not give his consent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>but saying farewell and telling them, “I will return to you again if God wills,” he set sail from Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>And when he arrived at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>And after spending some time there, he departed, traveling through one place after another in the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>Now a certain Jew ˻named˼ Apollos, ˻a native˼ Alexandrian, arrived in Ephesus—an eloquent man who was well-versed in the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and being enthusiastic in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things about Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained the way of God to him more accurately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>And when he wanted to cross over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged himand wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, ˻he˼ assisted greatly those who had believed through grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>For he was vigorously refuting the Jews in public, demonstrating through the scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>And it happened that while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the inland regions and came down to Ephesus and found some disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>And he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” And they said to him, “But we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>And he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” And they said, “Into the baptism of John.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>And Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people that they should believe in the one who was to come after him—that is, in Jesus.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>And when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>And when Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>(Now the total numberof men was about twelve.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>So he entered into the synagogue and was speaking boldly for three months, discussing and attempting to convince themof the things concerning the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>But when some became hardened and were disobedient, reviling the Way before the congregation, he departed from them and took away the disciples, leading discussions every day in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>And this took place for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>And God was performing ˻extraordinary˼ miracles by the hands of Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>so that even handkerchiefs or work aprons ˻that had touched his skin˼ were carried away to those who were sick, and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>But some iterant Jewish exorcists also attempted to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>(Now seven sons of a certain Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>But the evil spirit answered and said to them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with, but who are you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>And the man ˻who had the evil spirit˼ leaped on them, subdued all of them, and prevailed against them, so that they ran away from that house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>And this became known to all who lived in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was exalted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>And many of those who had believed came, confessing and disclosing their practices,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>and many of those who practiced magic brought together their books and burned them up in the sight of everyone. And they counted up their value and found it was˻fifty thousand silver coins˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>In this way the word of the Lord was growing in power and was prevailing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>Now when these things were completed, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, “After I have been there, it is necessary for me to see Rome also.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>So after sending two of those who were assisting him, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, he himself stayed some time in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>Now there happened at that time no little disturbance concerning the Way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>For someone ˻named˼ Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver replicas of the temple of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the craftsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>˻These˼ he gathered together, and the workers occupied with such things, and said, “Men, you know that from this business ˻we get our prosperity˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>and you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this man Paul has persuaded and turned away a large crowd by saying that the gods made by hands are not gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>So not only is there a danger this line of business of ours will come into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be regarded as nothing—and she is about to be brought down even from her grandeur, she whom the whole of Asia and the entire world worship!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>And when they heard this and became full of rage, they began to shout, saying, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>And the city was filled with the tumult, and with one purpose they rushed into the theater, seizing Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were traveling companions of Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>But when Paul wanted to enter into the popular assembly, the disciples would not let him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>And even some of the Asiarchs who were his friends sent word to him and were urging him not to risk himself by going into the theater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>So some were shouting one thingand some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and the majority did not know ˻why˼ they had assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>And some of the crowd advised Alexander, when the Jews put him forward. But Alexander, motioning with his hand, was wanting to defend himself to the popular assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>But when they recognized that he was a Jew, they were shouting with one voice from all of them for about two hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>And when the city secretary had quieted the crowd, he said, “Ephesian men, for who is there among men who does not know the Ephesian city is honorary temple keeper of the great Artemis and of her image fallen from heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>Therefore because these things are undeniable, it is necessary that you be quiet and do nothing rash!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>For you have brought these men herewho are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>If then Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against anyone, the court days are observed and there are proconsuls—let them bring charges against one another!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>But if you desire anything further, it will be settled in the lawful assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>For indeed we are in danger of being accused of rioting concerning today, since there is no cause in relation to which we will be able to give an account concerning this disorderly gathering!” And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>Now after the turmoil had ceased, Paul summoned the disciples, and after encouraging them, he said farewell and departed to travel to Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>And after he had gone through those regions and encouraged them ˻at length˼, he came to Greece</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>and stayed three months. Because a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he came to a decision to return through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>And Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, and Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, and Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia, were accompanying him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>And these had gone on ahead and were waiting for us in Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread and came to them at Troas within five days, where we stayed seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>And on the first day of the week, when we had assembled to break bread, Paul began conversing with them, because he was going to leave on the next day, and he extended his message until midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>Now there were quite a few lamps in the upstairs room where we were gathered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>And a certain young man ˻named˼ Eutychus who was sitting in the window was sinking into a deep sleep while Paul was conversing at length. Being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>But Paul went down and threw himself on him, and putting his arms around him, said, “Do not be distressed, for his life is in him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>So he went up and broke bread, and when he had eaten and talked for a long time, until dawn, then he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>And they led the youth away alive, and ˻were greatly˼ comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>But we went on ahead to the ship and put out to sea for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there. For having made arrangements in this way, he himself was intending to travel by land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.14'>And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>And we sailed from there on the next day, and arrived opposite Chios. And on the next day we approached Samos, and on the following day we came to Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he would not be having to spend time in Asia. For he was hurrying if it could be possible for him to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>And from Miletus he sent word to Ephesus and summoned the elders of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>And when they came to him, he said to them, “You know from the first day on which I set foot in Asia how I was the whole time with you—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>serving the Lord with all humility and with tears, and with the trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>how I did not shrink from proclaiming to you anything that would be profitable, and from teaching you in public and from house to house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>testifying both to Jews and to Greeks with respect to repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>“And now behold, bound by the Spirit I am traveling to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me ˻there˼,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But I consider my life as worth ˻nothing˼ to myself, in order to finish my mission and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>“And now behold, I know that all of you, among whom I went about proclaiming the kingdom, will see my face no more.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.27'>for I did not shrink from proclaiming to you the whole purpose of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.28'>Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock among which the Holy Spirit has appointed you as overseers, to shepherd the church of God which he obtained through the blood of his own Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.29'>I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.30'>And from among you yourselves men will arise, speaking ˻perversions of the truth˼ in order to draw away the disciples after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.31'>Therefore be on the alert, remembering that night and day for three years I did not stop warning each one of you with tears.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>And when he had said these things, he fell to his knees and prayed with them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>And there was considerable weeping by all, and ˻hugging˼ Paul, they kissed him,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.21'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.1'>And it happened that after we tore ourselves away from them, we put out to sea, and running a straight course we came to Cos and on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.2'>And finding a ship that was crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and put out to sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.3'>And after we sighted Cyprus and left it behind ˻on the port side˼, we sailed to Syria and arrived at Tyre, because the ship was to unload its cargo there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.4'>And we stayed there seven days after we found the disciples, who kept telling Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.21.6'>we said farewell to one another and embarked in the ship, and they returned to their own homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.7'>And when we had completed the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. And after we greeted the brothers, we stayed one day with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.8'>And on the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.9'>(˻Now this man had˼ four virgin daughters who prophesied.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.10'>And while we were staying there many days, a certain prophet ˻named˼ Agabus came down from Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.11'>And he came to us and took Paul’s belt. Tying up his own feet and hands, he said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says: ‘In this way the Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the man whose belt this is, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.12'>And when we heard these things, both we and the local residents urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.13'>Then Paul replied, “What are you doing weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be tied up, but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>And because he would not be persuaded, we remained silent, saying, “The will of the Lord be done.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>So after these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>And some of the disciples from Caesarea also traveled together with us, bringing us to a certain Mnason of Cyprus, a disciple of long standing, with whom we were to be entertained as guests.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>And on the next day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>And after greeting them, he began to relate ˻one after the other˼the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>And when they heard this, they began to glorify God. And they said to him, “You see, brother, how many ten thousands there are among the Jews who have believed, and they are all zealous adherents of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>And they have been informed about you that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles the abandonment of Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or to live according to our customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>What then ˻is to be done˼? Doubtless they will all hear that you have come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>Therefore do this that we tell you: ˻we have˼ four men who have taken a vow on themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>Take these menand purify yourself along with them and ˻pay their expenses˼ so that they can shave their heads, and everyone will know that the things which they had been informed about you are nothing, but you yourself also agree with observing the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we have written a letter after deciding they should avoid food sacrificed to idols and blood and what has been strangled and sexual immorality.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul took along the men on the next day, andafter he had purified himself together with them, he entered into the temple courts, announcing the completion of the days of purification until ˻the time˼ the offering would be presented on behalf of each one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>But when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia who had seen him in the temple courts stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>shouting, “Israelite men, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place! And furthermore he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>(For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they thought that Paul had brought into the temple.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>And the whole city was stirred up, and the people came running together, and they seized Paul and dragged him outside of the temple courts, and immediately the doors were shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>And as they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the military tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>˻He˼ immediately took along soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the military tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>Then the military tribune came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what it was that he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>But some in the crowd were shouting one thing and others another, and because he was not able to find out the truth on account of the commotion, he gave orders to bring him into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>And when he came to the steps, it happened that he had to be carried by the soldiers on account of the violence of the crowd,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>for the crowd of people was following them, shouting, “Away with him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>And as he was about to be brought into the barracks, Paul said to the military tribune, “Is it permitted for me to say something to you?” And he said, “Do you know Greek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>Then you are not the Egyptian who before these days raised a revolt and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>But Paul said, “I am a Jewish man from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no unimportant city. Now I ask you, allow me to speak to the people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>So when he permitted him, Paul, standing there on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he addressed them in the Aramaic language, saying,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>“Men—brothers and fathers—listen to my defense to you now!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Aramaic language, ˻they became even more silent˼. And he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>“I am a Jewish man born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, educated according to the exactness of the law received from our fathers, being zealous for God, just as all of you are today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>˻I˼ persecuted this Way to the death, tying up and delivering to prison both men and women,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>as indeed the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me, from whom also I received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and was traveling there to lead away those who were there also tied up to Jerusalem so that they could be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>“And it happened that as I was traveling and approaching Damascus around noon, suddenly a very bright light from heaven flashed around me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>And I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me, ‘I am Jesus the Nazarene whom you are persecuting.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>(Now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>So I said, ‘What should I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, ‘Get up and proceed to Damascus, and there it will be told to you about all the things that have been appointed for you to do.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>And as I could not see as a result of the brightness of that light, I arrived in Damascus led by the hand of those who were with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>And a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who live there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>came to me and stood by meand said to me, ‘Brother Saul, regain your sight!’ And at that same time I looked up at him and saw him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>And he said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>because you will be a witness for him to all people of what you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>And now why are you delaying? Get up, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>“And it happened that when I returned to Jerusalem and I was praying in the temple courts, I was in a trance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>and saw him saying to me, ‘Hurry and depart ˻quickly˼ from Jerusalem, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that from synagogue to synagogue I was imprisoning and beating those who believed in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>And when the blood of your witness Stephen was being shed, I myself also was standing near and was approving, and was guarding the cloaks of those who were killing him.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>And he said to me, ‘Go, because I will send you far away to the Gentiles!’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>Now they were listening to him until this word, and they raised their voices, saying, “Away with such a man from the earth! For it is not fitting for him to live!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>And while they were screaming and throwing off their cloaks and throwing dust into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the military tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, saying he was to be examined with a lash so that he could find out for what reason they were crying out against him in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>But when they had stretched him out for the lash, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it permitted for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>And when the centurion heard this, he went to the military tribune and reported it, saying, “What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>So the military tribune came and said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” And he said, “Yes.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>And the military tribune replied, “I acquired this citizenship for a large sum of money.” And Paul said, “But I indeed was born a citizen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>Then immediately those who were about to examine him kept away from him, and the military tribune also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman citizen and that ˻he had tied him up˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>But on the next day, because he wanted to know the true reason why he was being accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin to assemble, and he brought down Paul and had him stand before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>And looking intently at the Sanhedrin, Paul said, “Men and brothers, I have lived my life in all good conscience before God to this day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>So the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near him to strike his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! And are you sitting there judging me according to the law, and acting contrary to the law do you order me to be struck?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>And those who stood nearby said, “Are you reviling the high priest of God?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>And Paul said, “I did not know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, ‘You must not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>Now when Paul realized that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he shouted out in the Sanhedrin, “Men and brothers! I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees! I am being judged concerning the hope and the resurrection of the dead!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>And when he said this, a dispute developed between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>(For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection or angel or spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>And there was loud shouting, and some of the scribes from the party of the Pharisees stood up and contended sharply, saying, “We find nothing wrong with this man! But what if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>And when the dispute became severe, the military tribune, fearing lest Paul be torn apart by them, ordered the detachment to go down, take him away from their midst, and bring him into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>And the next night the Lord stood by him and said, “Have courage, for as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>And when it was day, the Jews made a conspiracy and bound themselves under a curse, saying they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>Now there were more than forty who had made this conspiracy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>who went to the chief priests and the elders and said, “We have bound ourselves under a curse to partake of nothing until we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>Therefore, now you along with the Sanhedrin explain to the military tribune that he should bring him down to you, as if you were going to determine more accurately the things concerning him. And we are ready to do away with him before he comes near.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>But when the son of Paul’s sister heard about the ambush, he came and entered into the barracks and reported it to Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>So Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Bring this young man to the military tribune, because he has something to report to him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>So he took him and brought him to the military tribune and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>And the military tribune, taking hold of his hand and withdrawing privately, asked, “What is it that you have to report to me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>And he said, “The Jews have agreed to ask you that you bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin tomorrow, as if they were going to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>You therefore do not be persuaded by them, because more than forty men of ˻their number˼ are lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have done away with him. And now they are ready, waiting for ˻you to agree˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>So the military tribune sent the young man away, directing him, “Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>And he summoned two of the centurions and said, “Make ready from the third hour of the night two hundred soldiers and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, in order that they may proceed as far as Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>And provide mounts so that they can put Paul on them and bring him safely to Felix the governor.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>˻He wrote˼ a letter that had this form:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>"Claudius Lysias.To his excellency Governor Felix.Greetings!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the detachment and rescued him, because I learned that he was a Roman citizen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>And because I wanted to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>I found ˻he˼ was accused concerning controversial questions of their law, but having no charge deserving death or imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>And when it was made known to me there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you immediately, also ordering his accusers to state ˻the charges˼ against him before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>"Therefore the soldiers, in accordance with ˻their orders˼, took Paul and brought him to Antipatris during the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>And on the next day they let the horsemen go on with him, and they returned to the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>˻The horsemen˼, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, also presented Paul to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>So after reading the letter and asking what province he was from, and learning that he was from Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>he said, “I will give you a hearing whenever your accusers arrive also,” giving orders for him to be guarded in the praetorium of Herod.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and an attorney, a certain Tertullus, all of whom brought charges against Paul to the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>And when he had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “We have experienced much peace through you, and reforms are taking place in this nation through your foresight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>Both in every way and everywhere we acknowledge this, most excellent Felix, with all gratitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>But so that I may not impose on you for longer, I implore you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>For we have found this man to be a public menace and one who causes riots among all the Jews throughout the Roman Empire and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>who even attempted to desecrate the temple, and we arrested ˻him﻿˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>When you yourself examine him you will be able to find out from ˻him˼ about all these things of which we are accusing him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>And the Jews also joined in the attack, asserting these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>And when the governor gestured for him to speak, Paul replied, “Because I know you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I defend myself cheerfully with respect to the things concerning myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>You can ascertain that ˻it has not been more than˼ twelve days ˻since˼ I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>And neither did they find me arguing with anyone or making a crowd develop in the temple courts nor in the synagogues nor throughout the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>Nor can they prove the things to you concerning which they are now accusing me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>But I do confess this to you, that according to the Way (which they call a sect), so I worship the God of our fathers, believing all things that are in accordance with the law and that are written in the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>having a hope in God which these men also themselves await: that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>˻For this reason˼ also I myself ˻always˼ do my best to have a clear conscience toward God and people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>So after many years, I came to practice charitable giving and offerings to my people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>in which they found me purified in the temple courts, not with a crowd or with a disturbance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>But there are some Jews from Asia who ought to be present before you and bring charges against me, if they have anything against me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>or these men themselves should say what crime they found when I stood before the Sanhedrin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>other than concerning this one declaration that I shouted while standing there before them: ‘I am being judged before you today concerning the resurrection of the dead!’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>But Felix, because he understood the facts concerning the Way more accurately, put them off, saying, “When Lysias the military tribune comes down, I will decide ˻your case˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>He ordered the centurion for him to be guarded and to have some freedom, and in no way to prevent any of his own peoplefrom serving him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>And after some days, when Felix arrived with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and listened to him concerning faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>And while he was discussing about righteousness and self control and the judgment that is to come, Felix became afraid and replied, “Go away for the present, and when I have an opportunity, I will summon you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>At the same time he was also hoping that money would be given to him by Paul. For this reason also he sent for him as often as possible and talked with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>And when two years had passed, Felix received as successor Porcius Festus. And because he wanted to do a favor for the Jews, Felix left Paul behind ˻as a prisoner˼.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Now when Festus set foot in the province, after three days he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>And the chief priests and the most prominent men of the Jews brought charges against Paul to him, and were urging him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>asking for a favor against him, that he summon him to Jerusalem, because they were preparing an ambush to do away with him along the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>Then Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and he himself was about to go there in a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>So he said, “Let those among you who are prominent go down with me, and if there is any wrong in the man, let them bring charges against him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>And after he had stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea. On the next day he sat down on the judgment seat and gave orders for Paul to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>And when he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges that they were not able to prove,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>while Paul said in his defense, “Neither against the law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I sinned with reference to anything!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>But Festus, because he wanted to do a favor for the Jews, answered and said to Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be tried before me there concerning these things?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>But Paul said, “I am standing before the judgment seat of Caesar, where it is necessary for me to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>If then I am doing wrong and have done anything deserving death, I am not trying to avoid dying. But if there is nothing true of the things which these people are accusing me, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>Then Festus, after discussing this with his council, replied, “You have appealed to Caesar—to Caesar you will go!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>Now after some days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to welcome Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>And while they were staying there many days, Festus laid out the case against Paul to the king, saying, “There is a certain man left behind by Felix as a prisoner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>concerning whom when I was in Jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the Jews presented evidence, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>To ˻them˼ I replied that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up any man before the one who had been accused met his accusers face to face and received an opportunity for a defense concerning the accusation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>Therefore, when they had assembled here, I made no delay; on the next day I sat down on the judgment seat and gave orders for the man to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>When they stood up, his accusers began bringing no charge concerning ˻him˼ of the evil deeds that I was suspecting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>but they had some issues with him concerning their own religion, and concerning a certain Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul claimed to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>And because I was at a loss with regard to the investigation concerning these things, I asked if he was willing to go to Jerusalem and to be judged there concerning these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But when Paul appealed that he be kept under guard for the decision of His Majesty the Emperor, I gave orders for him to be kept under guard until I could send him to Caesar.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>So Agrippa said to Festus, “I want to hear the man myself also.” “Tomorrow,” he said, “you will hear him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>So on the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came with great pageantry and entered into the audience hall, along with military tribunes and the most prominent men of the city. And when Festus gave the order, Paul was brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>And Festus said, “King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole population of the Jews appealed to me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he must not live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>But I understood that he had done nothing deserving death himself, and when this man appealed to His Majesty the Emperor, I decided to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>I do not have anything definite to write to my lord about ˻him˼. Therefore I have brought him before you all—and especially before you, King Agrippa—so that after this preliminary hearing has taken place, I may have something to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner and not to indicate the charges against him.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>So Agrippa said to Paul, “It is permitted for you to speak for yourself.” Then Paul extended his hand and began to defend himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>“Concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that before you I am about to defend myself today,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>because you are especially acquainted with both all the customs and controversial questions with respect to the Jews. Therefore I beg you to listen to me with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>“Now all the Jews know my manner of life from my youth, that had taken place from the beginning among my own people and in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>having known me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that in accordance with the strictest party of our religion I lived as a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>And now I stand here on trial on the basis of hope in the promise made by God to our fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>to which our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly serve him night and day. Concerning this hope I am being accused by the Jews, O king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>Why is it thought incredible by you people that God raises the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>Indeed, I myself thought it was necessary to do many things opposed to the name of Jesus the Nazarene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>which I also did in Jerusalem, and not only did I lock up many of the saints in prison, having received authority from the chief priests, but also when they were being executed, I cast my vote against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>And throughout all the synagogues I punished them often and tried to force them to blaspheme, and because I was enraged at them beyond measure, I was pursuing them even as far as to foreign cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>In ˻this activity˼ I was traveling to Damascus with the authority and full power of the chief priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>In the middle of the day along the road, O king, I saw a light from heaven, more than the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who were traveling with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Aramaic language, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>So I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>But get up and stand on your feet, because for this reason I have appeared to you, to appoint you a servant and witness both to the things in which you saw me and to the things in which I will appear to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>rescuing you from the people and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>“Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>but to those in Damascus first, and in Jerusalem and all the region of Judea and to the Gentiles, I proclaimed that they should repent and turn to God, doing deeds worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>On account of these things the Jews seized me while I was in the temple courtsand were attempting to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>Therefore I have experienced help from God until this day, and I stand here testifying to both small and great, saying nothing except what both the prophets and Moses have said were going to happen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>that the Christ was to suffer and that as the first of the resurrection from the dead, he was going to proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “You are out of your mind, Paul! Your great learning ˻is driving˼ you ˻insane˼!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but am speaking words of truth and rationality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>For the king knows about these things, to whom also I am speaking freely, for I am not convinced that any of these things in any way has escaped his notice, because this ˻was˼ not ˻done˼ in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>Do you believe the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you believe.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>But Agrippa said to Paul, “In a short time are you persuading me to become a Christian?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>And Paul replied, “I pray to God, whether in a short time or in a long time, not only you but also all those who are listening to me today may become such people as I also am, except for these bonds!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>Both the king and the governor got up, and Bernice and those who were sitting with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>And as they were going out, they were talking to one another, saying, “This man is not doing anything deserving death or imprisonment.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>And when it was decided that we would sail away to Italy, they handed over Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion ˻named˼ Julius of the Augustan Cohort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>And we went aboard a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to the places along the coast of Asia and put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>And on the next day, we put in at Sidon. And Julius, treating Paul kindly, allowed him to go to his friends ˻to be cared for˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>And from there we put out to sea and sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>And after we had sailed across the open sea along Cilicia and Pamphylia, we put in at Myra in Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>And there the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us ˻on board˼ it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>And sailing slowly, in many days and with difficulty we came to Cnidus. Because the wind did not permit us to go further, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>And sailing along its coast with difficulty, we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near which was the town of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>And because considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous because even the Fast was already over, Paul strongly recommended,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>saying to them, “Men, I perceive that the voyage is going ˻to end˼ with disaster and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But the centurion was convinced even more by the shipmaster and the shipowner than by what was said by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>And because the harbor was unsuitable for spending the winter in, the majority decided on a plan to put out to sea from there, if somehow they could arrive at Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing toward the southwest and toward the northwest, to spend the winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>And when a southwest wind began to blow gently, because they thought they could accomplish their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed close along Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But not long afterward a wind like a hurricane, called the northeaster, rushed down from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>And when the ship was caught and was not able to head into the wind, we gave way and were driven along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>And running under the lee of a certain small island called Cauda, we were able with difficulty to get the ship’s boat under control.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>After hoisting ˻it up˼, they made use of supports to undergird the ship. And because they were afraid lest they run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and thus were driven along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>And because we were violently battered by the storm, on the next day˻they began˼ jettisoning the cargo,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>and on the third day they threw overboard the gear of the ship with their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>But when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and with not a little bad weather confronting us, finally all hope was abandoned that we would be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>And because many were experiencing lack of appetite, at that time Paul stood up in their midst and said, “Men, you ought to have followed my advice not to put out to sea from Crete, and thus avoided this damage and loss!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>And now I urge you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life from among you, but only of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>For this night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve came to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul! It is necessary for you to stand before Caesar, and behold, God has graciously granted you all who are sailing with you.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>Therefore keep up your courage, men, for I believe God that it will be like this—according to ˻the˼ way it was told to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>But it is necessary that we run aground on some island.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>And when the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven in the Adriatic Sea about the middle of the night, the sailors suspected ˻they were approaching some land˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>And taking soundings, they found twenty fathoms. So going on a little further and taking soundings again, they found fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>And because they were afraid lest somewhere we run aground against rough places, they threw down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>And when the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship and were lowering the ship’s boat into the sea, pretending as if they were going to lay out anchors from the bow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain with the ship, you cannot be saved!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship’s boat and let it fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>And until the day was about to come, Paul was urging them all to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day you have waited anxiously, and you have continued without eating, having taken nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>Therefore I urge you to take some food, for this is necessary for your preservation. For not a hair from your head will be lost.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>And after he said these things and took bread, he gave thanks to God in front of them all, and after breaking it, he began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>So they all were encouraged and partook of food themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>(Now we were in all two hundred seventy six persons on the ship.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>And when they had eaten their fill of food, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>Now when day came, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay having a beach, onto which they decided to run the ship ashore if they could.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>And slipping the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes of the steering oars. And hoisting the foresail to the wind that was blowing, they held course for the beach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>But falling into a place of crosscurrents, they ran the ship aground. And the bow stuck fast and stayed immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>Now the plan of the soldiers was that they would kill the prisoners lest any escape by swimming away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>but the centurion, because he wanted to save Paul, prevented them ˻from doing what they intended˼, and gave orders that those who were able to swim should jump in first to get to the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>and then the rest, some of whom floated on planks and some of whom on anything that was from the ship. And in this way all were brought safely to the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>And after we were brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>And the local inhabitants showed ˻extraordinary˼ kindness to us, for they lit a fire and welcomed us all, because of the rain that had begun and because of the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>And when Paul had gathered a large number of sticks and was placing them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>And when the local people saw the creature hanging from his hand, they began saying to one another, “Doubtless this man is a murderer whom, although he was rescued from the sea, Justice has not permitted to live!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>He, in turn, shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>But they were expecting that he was going to swell up or suddenly to fall down dead. So after they had waited for a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and began saying that he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>Now in the regions around that place were fields belonging to the chief official of the island, ˻named˼ Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>And it happened that the father of Publius was lying down, afflicted with fever and dysentery. Paul went to ˻him˼ and after praying, he placed his hands on him and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>And after this had taken place, the rest of those on the island who had diseases were coming and being healed also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>They also honored us with many honors, and when we were putting out to sea, they gave us the things˻we needed˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>Now after three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered at the island, an Alexandrian one˻with the twin gods Castor and Pollux as its insignia˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>And putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>From there we got underway and arrived at Rhegium, and after one day a south wind came up and on the second day we came to Puteoli,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>where we found brothers, and were implored to stay with them seven days. And in this way we came to Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>And from there the brothers, when they heard the news about us, came to meet us as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns. When he saw them, Paul gave thanks to God and took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>And when we entered into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who was guarding him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>Now it happened that after three days, he called together those who were the most prominent of the Jews. And when they had assembled, he said to them, “Men and brothers, although I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, from Jerusalem I was delivered as a prisoner into the hands of the Romans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>who, when they had examined me, were wanting to release me, because there was no basis for an accusation worthy of death with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But because the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar (not as if I had any charge to bring against my own people).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>Therefore for this reason I have requested to see you and to speak with you, for because of the hope of Israel I am wearing this chain!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>And they said to him, “We have received no letters about you from Judea, nor has any of the brothers come and reported or spoken anything evil about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we would like to hear from you what you think, for concerning this sect it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>And when they had set a day with him, many more came to him at his lodging place, to whom he was explaining from early in the morning until evening, testifying about the kingdom of God and attempting to convince them about Jesus from both the law of Moses and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>And some were convinced by what was said, but others refused to believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>So being in disagreement with one another, they began to leave after Paul made one statement: “The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through the prophet Isaiah to your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>saying,‘Go to this people and say,“˻You will keep on hearing˼ and will never understand,and ˻you will keep on seeing˼ and will never perceive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>For the heart of this people has become dull,and with their ears they hear with difficulty,and they have shut their eyes,lest they see with their eyes,and hear with their ears,and understand with their heart,and turn, and I would heal them.” ’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles. They also will listen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>So he stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and welcomed all who came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>which he promised previously through his prophets in the holy scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>concerning his Son, who was born ˻a descendant˼ of David according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>who was declared Son of God in power according to ˻the Holy Spirit˼ by the resurrection from the dead of Jesus Christ our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>through whom we have received grace and apostleship for the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles on behalf of his name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>To all those in Rome who are loved by God, called to be saints. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being proclaimed in the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, is my witness, how constantly I make mention of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>always asking in my prayers if somehow now at last I may succeed to come to you in the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I desire to see you, in order that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, in order to strengthen you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>that is, to be encouraged together with you through ˻our mutual faith˼, both yours and mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>Now I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that often I intended to come to you, and was prevented until now, in order that I might have some fruit among you also, just as also among the rest of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>Thus ˻I am eager˼ to proclaim the gospel also to you who are in Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>For the righteousness of God is revealed in it from faith to faith, just as it is written, “But the one who is righteous by faith will live.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all impiety and unrighteousness of people, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>because what can be known about God is evident among them, for God made it clear to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>For from the creation of the world, his invisible attributes, both his eternal power and deity, are discerned clearly, being understood in the things created, so that they are without excuse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their reasoning, and their senseless hearts were darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Claiming to be wise, they became fools,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God with the likeness of an image of mortal human beings and birds and quadrupeds and reptiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to immorality, that their bodies would be dishonored among themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>who exchanged the truth of God with a lie, and worshiped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed for eternity. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>Because of this, God gave them over to degrading passions, for their females exchanged the natural relations for those contrary to nature,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>and likewise also the males, abandoning the natural relations with the female, were inflamed in their desire toward one another, males with males committing the shameless deed, and receiving in themselves the penalty that was necessary for their error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And just as they did not see fit ˻to recognize God˼, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do the things that are not proper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greediness, malice, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malevolence. They are gossipers,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>senseless, faithless, unfeeling, unmerciful,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>who, although they know the requirements of God, that those who do such things are worthy of death, not only do they do the same things, but also they approve of those who do them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Therefore you are without excuse, O man, every one of you who passes judgment. For in that which you pass judgment on someone else, you condemn yourself, for you who are passing judgment are doing the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>Now we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who do such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>But do you think this, O man who passes judgment on those who do such things, and who does the same things, that you will escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or do you despise the wealth of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentence?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart, you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>who will reward each one according to his works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>to those who, by perseverance in good work, seek glory and honor and immortality, eternal life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>but to those who act from selfish ambition and who disobey the truth, but who obey unrighteousness, wrath and anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>There will be affliction and distress for every ˻human being˼ who does evil, of the Jew first and of the Greek,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>For there is no partiality with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in the sight of God, but the doers of the law will be declared righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things of the law, these, although they do not have the law, are a law to themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>who show the work of the law written on their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts one after another accusing or even defending them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>on the day when God judges the secret things of people, according to my gospel, through Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>and know his will and approve the things that are superior, because you are instructed by the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of those in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>Therefore, the one who teaches someone else, do you not teach yourself? The one who preaches not to steal, do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>The one who says not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? The one who abhors idols, do you rob temples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>Who boast in the law, by the transgression of the law you dishonor God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>For just as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>For circumcision is of value if you do the law, but if you should be a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>Therefore, if the uncircumcised person follows the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be credited for circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>And the uncircumcised person by nature who carries out the law will judge you who, though provided with ˻the precise written code˼ and circumcision are a transgressor of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For the Jew is not ˻one outwardly˼, nor is circumcision ˻outwardly˼, in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>But the Jew ˻is one inwardly˼, and circumcision is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter, whose praise is not from people but from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>Therefore, what is the advantage of the Jew, or what is the use of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much in every way. For first, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>˻What is the result˼ if some refused to believe? Their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God, will it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>May it never be! But let God be true but every human being a liar, just as it is written,“In order that you may be justified in your words,and may prevail when you are judged.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? God, who inflicts wrath, is not unjust, is he? (I am speaking according to a human perspective.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>May it never be! For otherwise, how will God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>But if by my lying, the truth of God abounded to his glory, why am I also still condemned as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>And why not (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say), “Let us do evil, in order that good may come of it? Their condemnation is just!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? Do we have an advantage? Not at all. For we have already charged both Jews and Greeks are all under sin,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>Their feet are swift to shed blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>destruction and distress are in their paths,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>and they have not known the way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>The fear of God is not before their eyes.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those under the law, in order that every mouth may be closed and the whole world may become accountable to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>For by the works of the law ˻no person will be declared righteous˼ before him, for through the law comes knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified about by the law and the prophets—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>that is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. For there is no distinction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>being justified as a gift by his grace, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>whom God made publicly available as the mercy seat through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness, because of the passing over of previously committed sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>in the forbearance of God, for the demonstration of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just and the one who justifies the person by faith in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Therefore, where is boasting? It has been excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>For we consider a person to be justified by faith apart from the works of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Or is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, also of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>since God is one, who will justify ˻those who are circumcised˼ by faith and ˻those who are uncircumcised˼ through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Therefore, do we nullify the law through faith? May it never be! But we uphold the law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What then shall we say that Abraham, our ancestor according to the flesh, has found?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what does the scripture say? “And Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>Now to the one who works, his pay is not credited according to grace, but according to his due.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>But to the one who does not work, but who believes in the one who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited for righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>just as David also speaks about the blessing of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>“Blessed are they whose lawless deeds have been forgiven,and whose sins are covered over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>Blessed is the person against whom the Lord will never count sin.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Therefore, is this blessing for ˻those who are circumcised˼, or also for ˻those who are uncircumcised˼? For we say, “Faith was credited to Abraham for righteousness.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How then was it credited? While he was ˻circumcised˼ or ˻uncircumcised˼? Not ˻while circumcised˼ but ˻while uncircumcised˼!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness by faith which he had˻while uncircumcised˼, so that he could be the father of all who believe ˻although they are uncircumcised˼, so that righteousness could be credited to them also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>and the father ˻of those who are circumcised˼ to those who are not only from the circumcision, but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham ˻which he had while uncircumcised˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants, that he would be heir of the world, was not through the law, but through the righteousness by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if those of the law are heirs, faith is rendered void and the promise is nullified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>For the law produces wrath, but where there is no law, neither is there transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Because of this, it is by faith, in order that it may be according to grace, so that the promise may be secure to all the descendants, not only to those of the law, but also to those of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>(just as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”) before God, in whom he believed, the one who makes the dead alive and who calls the things that are not as though they are,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>who against hope believed in hope, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was said, “so will your descendants be.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>And not being weak in faith, he considered his own body already as good as dead, because he was approximately a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>And he did not waver in unbelief at the promise of God, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>and being fully convinced that what he had promised, he was also able to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>Therefore, indeed, it was credited to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>But it was not written for the sake of him alone that it was credited to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>but also for the sake of us to whom it is going to be credited, to those who believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>who was handed over on account of our trespasses, and was raised up in the interest of our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Therefore, because we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>through whom also we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we boast in the hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only this, but we also boast in our afflictions, because we know that affliction produces patient endurance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>and patient endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>For while we were still helpless, yet at the proper time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>For only rarely will someone die on behalf of a righteous person (for on behalf of a good person possibly someone might even dare to die),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>but God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Therefore, by much more, because we have been declared righteous now by his blood, we will be saved through him from the wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, by much more, having been reconciled, we will be saved by his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only this, but also we are boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Because of this, just as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin, so also death spread to all people because all sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>For until the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not charged to one’s account when there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>But death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin in the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of the one who is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>˻But the gift is not like the trespass˼, for if by the trespass of the one, the many died, by much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, multiply to the many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And the gift is not as through the one who sinned, for on the one hand, judgment from the one sinled to condemnation, but the gift, from many trespasses, led to justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through the one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>Consequently therefore, as through one trespass came condemnation to all people, so also through one righteous deed came justification of life to all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For just as through the disobedience of the one man, the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one, the many will be made righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>Now the law came in as a side issue, in order that the trespass could increase, but where sin increased, grace was present in greater abundance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>so that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What therefore shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, in order that grace may increase?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>May it never be! How can we who died to sin still live in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Or do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we may live ˻a new way of life˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For if we have become identified with him in the likeness of his death, certainly also we will be identified with him in the likeness of his resurrection,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>knowing this, that our old man was crucified together with him, in order that the body of sin may be done away with, that we may no longer be enslaved to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For the one who has died has been freed from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>knowing that Christ, because he has been raised from the dead, is going to die no more, death no longer being master over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>For that death he died, he died to sin once and never again, but that life he lives, he lives to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>So also you, consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, so that you obey its desires,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>and do not present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead, and your members to God as instruments of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>For sin will not be master over you, because you are not under law, but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Do you not know that to whomever you present yourselves as slaves for obedience, you are slaves to whomever you obey, whether sin, leading to death, or obedience, leading to righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>But thanks be to God that you were slaves of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart the pattern of teaching to which you were entrusted,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>and having been set free from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>(I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh.) For just as you presented your members as slaves to immorality and lawlessness, leading to lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness, leading to sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with respect to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>Therefore what sort of fruit did you have then, about which you are now ashamed? For the end of those thingsis death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But now, having been set free from sin and having been enslaved to God, you have your fruit leading to sanctification, and its end is eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.23'>For the compensation due sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Or do you not know, brothers (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law is master of a person for as long a time as he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>Therefore as a result, if she belongs to another man while her husband is living, she will be called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress if she belongs to another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>So then, my brothers, you also were brought to death with respect to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to the one who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For when we were in the flesh, sinful desires were working through the law in our members, to bear fruit for death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now we have been released from the law, because we have died to that by which we were bound, so that we may serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What then shall we say? Is the law sin? May it never be! But I would not have known sin except through the law, for I would not have known covetousness if the law had not said, “Do not covet.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>And I was alive once, apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>and I died, and this commandment which was to lead to life was found with respect to me to lead to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Therefore, did that which is good become death to me? May it never be! Rather it was sin, in order that it might be recognized as sin, producing death through what is good for me, in order that sin might become sinful to an extraordinary degree through the commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, ˻sold into slavery to sin˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For what I am doing I do not understand, because what I want to do, this I do not practice, but what I hate, this I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>But if what I do not want to do, this I do, I agree with the law that it is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>But now I am no longer the one doing it, but sin that lives in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>For I know that good does not live in me, that is, in my flesh. For the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For the good that I want to do, I do not do, but the evil that I do not want to do, this I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>But if what I do not want to do, this I am doing, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin that lives in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>Consequently, I find the principle with me, the one who wants to do good, that evil is present with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I joyfully agree with the law of God in my inner person,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>but I observe another law in my members, at war with the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that exists in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>But thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself with my mind am enslaved to the law of God, but with my flesh I am enslaved to the law of sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>Consequently, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For what was impossible for the law, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>in order that the requirement of the law would be fulfilled in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>For those who are living according to the flesh are intent on the things of the flesh, but those who are living according to the Spirit are intent on the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>For the mindset of the flesh is death, but the mindset of the Spirit is life and peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>because the mindset of the flesh is enmity toward God, for it is not subjected to the law of God, for it is not able to do so,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>and those who are in the flesh are not able to please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, this person ˻does not belong to him˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>But if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>And if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, the one who raised Christ from the dead will also make alive your mortal bodies through his Spirit who lives in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>So then, brothers, we are obligated not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>For if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>For all those who are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba! Father!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>The Spirit himself confirms to our spirit that we are children of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>and if children, also heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer together with him so that we may also be glorified together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>For I consider that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is about to be revealed to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the eagerly expecting creation awaits eagerly the revelation of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creation has been subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of the one who subjected it, in hope</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>that the creation itself also will be set free from its servility to decay, into the glorious freedom of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>For we know that the whole creation groans together and suffers agony together until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>Not only this, but we ourselves also, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves while we await eagerly our adoption, the redemption of our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For in hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, for who hopes for what he sees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for what we do not see, we await it eagerly with patient endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>And likewise also, the Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not know how to pray as one ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for uswith unexpressed groanings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>And the one who searches our hearts knows what the mindset of the Spirit is, because he intercedes on behalf of the saints according to the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>And we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, for those who are called according to his purpose,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.29'>because those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be the firstborn among many brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.30'>And those whom he predestined, these he also called, and those whom he called, these he also justified, and those whom he justified, these he also glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>Indeed, he who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also, together with him, freely give us all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who will bring charges against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is the one who died, and more than that, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will affliction or distress or persecution or hunger or lack of sufficient clothing or danger or the sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>Just as it is written,“On account of you we are being put to death the whole day long;we are considered as sheep for slaughter.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>No, but in all these things we prevail completely through the one who loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.7'>nor are they all children because they are descendants of Abraham, but “In Isaac will your descendants be named.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.8'>That is, it is not the children ˻by human descent˼who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.9'>For the statement of the promise is this: “At this time I will return and ˻Sarah will have˼ a son.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.10'>And not only this, but also when Rebecca conceived children by one man, Isaac our father—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.11'>for although they had not yet been born, or done anything good or evil, in order that the purpose of God according to election might remain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.12'>not by works but by the one who calls—it was said to her, “The older will serve the younger,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.13'>just as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.14'>What then shall we say? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.15'>For to Moses he says, “I will have mercy on whomever I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I have compassion.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.16'>Consequently therefore, ˻it does not depend on the˼ one who wills or on the one who runs, but on God who shows mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.17'>For the scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very reason I have raised you up, so that I may demonstrate my power in you, and so that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.18'>Consequently therefore, he has mercy on whomever he wishes, and he hardens whomever he wishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.19'>Therefore you will say to me, “Why then does he still find fault? For who has resisted his will?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.20'>On the contrary, O man, who are you who answers back to God? Will what is molded say to the one who molded it, “Why did you make me like this”?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.21'>Or does the potter not have authority over the clay, to make from the same lump a vessel that is for ˻honorable use˼ and one that is for ˻ordinary use˼?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.22'>And what if God, wanting to demonstrate his wrath and to make known his power, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.23'>And he did so in order that he could make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy that he prepared beforehand for glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.24'>us whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.25'>As he also says in Hosea,“I will call those who were not my people, ‘My people,’and those who were not loved, ‘Loved.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.26'>And it will be in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’there they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.27'>And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel,“Even if the number of the sons of Israel is like the sand of the sea,the remnant will be saved,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.28'>˻for the Lord will execute his sentence thoroughly and decisively˼ upon the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.29'>And just as Isaiah foretold,“If the Lord of hosts had not left us descendants,we would have become like Sodomand would have resembled Gomorrah.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.30'>What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness—even the righteousness that is by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.31'>But Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, did not attain to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.32'>Why that? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if by works. They stumbled over the ˻stone that causes people to stumble˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.33'>just as it is written,“Behold, I am laying in Zion ˻a stone that causes people to stumble˼,and ˻a rock that causes them to fall˼,and the one who believes in him will not be put to shame.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.1'>Brothers, the desire of my heart and my prayer to God on behalf of them is for their salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.2'>For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.3'>For ignoring the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.4'>For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.5'>For Moses writes about the righteousness that is from the law: “The person who does these things will live by them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.6'>But the righteousness from faith speaks like this: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ down),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.7'>or “Who will descend into the abyss?” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.8'>But what does it say? “The word is near to you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.9'>that if you confess with your mouth “Jesus is Lord” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.10'>For with the heart one believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth one confesses, resulting in salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.11'>For the scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.12'>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lordis Lord of all, who is rich to all who call upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.13'>For “everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.14'>How then will they call upon him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in him about whom they have not heard? And how will they hear about him without one who preaches to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.15'>And how will they preach, unless they are sent? Just as it is written, “How timely are the feet of those who bring good news of good things.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.16'>But not all have obeyed the good news, for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.17'>Consequently, faith comes by hearing, and hearing through the word about Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.18'>But I say, they have not heard, have they? On the contrary,“Their voice has gone out to all the earth,and their words to the ends of the inhabited world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.19'>But I say, Israel did not know, did they? First, Moses says,“I will provoke you to jealousy by those who are not a nation;by a senseless nation I will provoke you to anger.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.20'>And Isaiah is very bold and says,“I was found by those who did not seek me;I became known to those who did not ask for me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.21'>But about Israel he says,“The whole day long I held out my handsto a disobedient and resistant people.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.1'>Therefore I say, God has not rejected his people, has he? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, from the descendants of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.2'>God has not rejected his people, whom he foreknew! Or do you not know, in the passage about Elijah, what the scripture says—how he appeals to God against Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.3'>“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.4'>But what does the divine response say to him? “I have left for myself seven thousand people who have not bent the knee to Baal.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.5'>So in this way also at the present time, there is a remnant ˻selected by grace˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.6'>But if by grace, it is no longer by works, for otherwise grace would no longer be grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.7'>What then? What Israel was searching for, this it did not obtain. But the elect obtained it, and the rest were hardened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.8'>just as it is written,“God gave them a spirit of stupor,eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear,until this very day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.9'>And David says,“Let their table become a snare and a trap,and a cause for stumbling and a retribution to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.10'>let their eyes be darkened so that they do not see,and cause their backs to bend ˻continually˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.11'>I say then, they did not stumble so that they fell, did they? May it never be! But by their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles, in order to provoke them to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.12'>And if their trespass means riches for the world and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness mean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.13'>Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Therefore, inasmuch as I am apostle to the Gentiles, I promote my ministry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.14'>if somehow I may provoke my people to jealousy and save some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.15'>For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean except life from the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.16'>Now if the first fruits are holy, so also is the whole batch of dough, and if the root is holy, so also are the branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.17'>Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although you were a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them and became a sharer of the root of the olive tree’s richness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.18'>do not boast against the branches. But if you boast against them, you do not support the root, but the root supports you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.19'>Then you will say, “Branches were broken off in order that I could be grafted in.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>Well said! They were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand firm because of faith. Do not think arrogant thoughts, but be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>For if God did not spare the ˻natural˼ branches, perhaps he will not spare you either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>See, then, the kindness and severity of God: severity upon those who have fallen, but upon you the kindness of God—if you continue in his kindness, for otherwise you also will be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>And those also, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, because God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are ˻natural branches˼ be grafted into their own olive tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery, so that you will not be wise in your own sight, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>and so all Israel will be saved, just as it is written,“The deliverer will come out of Zion;he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>And this is the covenant from me with themwhen I take away their sins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>With respect to the gospel, they are enemies for your sake, but with respect to election, they are dearly loved for the sake of the fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>For just as you formerly were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of the disobedience of these,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>so also these have now been disobedient for your mercy, in order that they also may now be shown mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>For God confined them all in disobedience, in order that he could have mercy on them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>Oh, the depth of the richesand the wisdom and the knowledge of God!How unsearchable are his judgmentsand how incomprehensible are his ways!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>For by the grace given to me I say to everyone who is among you not to think more highly of yourself than what one ought to think, but to think ˻sensibly˼, as God has apportioned a measure of faith to each one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.4'>For just as in one body we have many members, but all the members do not have the same function,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.5'>in the same way we who are many are one body in Christ, and ˻individually˼ members of one another,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>Let every person be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except by God, and those that exist are put in place by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>So then, the one who resists authority resists the ordinance which is from God, and those who resist will receive condemnation on themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For rulers are not a cause of terror for a good deed, but for bad conduct. So do you want not to be afraid of authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from it,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.15.11'>And again,“Praise the Lord, all the Gentiles,and let all the peoples praise him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.12'>And again Isaiah says,“The root of Jesse will come,even the one who rises to rule over the Gentiles;in him the Gentiles will put their hope.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.13'>Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.14'>Now I myself also am convinced about you, my brothers, that you yourselves also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to instruct one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>But I have written to you more boldly on some points, so as to remind you again because of the grace that has been given to me by God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.16'>with the result that I am a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving the gospel of God as a priest, in order that the offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.17'>Therefore I have a reason for boasting in Christ Jesus regarding the things concerning God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>For I will not dare to speak about anything except that which Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and traveling around as far as Illyricum I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>And so, having as my ambition to proclaim the gospel where Christ has not been named, in order that I will not build on the foundation belonging to someone else,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>but just as it is written,“Those to whom it was not announced concerning him will see,and those who have not heard will understand.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>For this reason also I was hindered many times from coming to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>and now, no longer having a place in these regions, but having a desire for many years to come to you</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>whenever I travel to Spain. For I hope while I am passing through to see you and to be sent on my way by you, whenever I have first enjoyed your company for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>But now I am traveling to Jerusalem, serving the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>For they were pleased to do so, and they are obligated to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they ought also to serve them in material things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>Therefore, after I have accomplished this and sealed this fruit for delivery to them, I will depart by way of you for Spain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>and I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>Now I exhort you, brothers, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit, to contend along with me in your prayers on my behalf to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and my ministry in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.32'>so that, coming to you with joy by the will of God, I may rest with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.33'>Now may the God of peace be with all of you. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.16.18'>For such people do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own stomach, and by smooth speech and flattery they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the church of God that is in Corinth, sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, together with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their Lord and ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I give thanks to my God always concerning you, because of the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that in everything you were made rich in him, in all speech and all knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>just as the testimony about Christ has been confirmed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that you do not lack in any spiritual gift as you eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful, by whom you were called to fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now I exhort you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all say the same thing and there not be divisions among you, and that you be made complete in the same mind and with the same purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it has been made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by ˻Chloe’s people˼, that there are quarrels among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>But I say this, that each of you is saying, “I am with Paul,” and “I am with Apollos,” and “I am with Cephas,” and “I am with Christ.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I give thanks to God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>lest anyone should say that you were baptized in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>(Now I also baptized the household of Stephanus. Beyond that I do not know if I baptized anyone else.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the gospel, not with ˻clever speech˼, lest the cross of Christ be emptied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written,“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,and the intelligence of the intelligent I will confound.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise person? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>For indeed, Jews ask for sign miracles and Greeks seek wisdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a cause for stumbling, but to the Gentiles foolishness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For consider your calling, brothers, that not many were wise according to human standards, not many were powerful, not many were well born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But the foolish things of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the wise, and the weak things of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the strong,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>and the insignificant of the world, and the despised, God chose, the things that are not, in order that he might abolish the things that are,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>so that all flesh may not boast before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But from him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>so that, just as it is written, “The one who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the mystery of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>and my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>in order that your faith would not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>Now we do speak wisdom among the mature, but wisdom not of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are perishing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery, which God predestined before the ages for our glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>which none of the rulers of this age knew. For if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But just as it is written,“Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard,and have not entered into the heart of man,are the things which God has prepared for those who love him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man that is in him? Thus also no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, in order that we may know the things freely given to us by God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>things which we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he is not able to understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>Now the spiritual person discerns all things, but he himself is judged by no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>“For who has known the mind of the Lord; who has advised him?” But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual people, but as to fleshly people, as to infants in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to eat it. But now you are still not able,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>for you are still fleshly. For where there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and do you not live like unregenerate people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For whenever anyone says, “I am with Paul,” and another, “I am with Apollos,” are you not merely human?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>Therefore, what is Apollos and what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, and to each as the Lord gave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing it to grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who is causing it to grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one, but each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building upon it. But each one must direct his attention to how he is building upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For no one is able to lay another foundation than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>Now if anyone builds upon the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>the work of each one will become evident. For the day will reveal it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the work of each one, of what sort it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If anyone’s work that he has built upon it remains, he will receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but so as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Do you not know that you are God’s temple and the Spirit of God dwells in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy this one. For God’s temple is holy, which you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks himself to be wise among you in this age, let him become a fool, in order that he may become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it is written, “The one who catches the wise in their craftiness,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>So then, let no one boast in people. For all things are yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all thingsare yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Thus let a person consider us as servants of Christ and stewards of God’s mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>In this case, moreover, it is sought in stewards that one be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But to me it is a very little matter that I be judged by you or by a human court, but I do not even judge myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For I am conscious of nothing against myself, but not by this am I vindicated. But the one who judges me is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord should come, who will both enlighten the hidden things of darkness and will reveal the counsels of hearts, and then praise will come to each one from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>Now I have applied these things, brothers, to myself and Apollos for your sake, in order that in us you may learn not to go beyond what is written, lest someone be inflated with pride on behalf of one person against the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who concedes you superiority? And what do you have that you did not receive? But if indeed you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Already you are satiated! Already you are rich! Apart from us you reign as kings! And would that indeed you reigned as kings, in order that we also might reign as kings with you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as condemned to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world and to angels and to people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are prudent in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, but we are dishonored!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Until the present hour we are both hungry and thirsty and poorly clothed and roughly treated and homeless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>and we toil, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>when we are slandered, we encourage. We have become like the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things, until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I am not writing these things to shame you, but admonishing you as my dear children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For if you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I fathered you through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>Therefore I exhort you, become imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>Because of this, I have sent to you Timothy, who is my dear and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ Jesus, just as I teach everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>But some have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I am coming to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will know not the talk of the ones who have become arrogant, but the power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God is not with talk, but with power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is reported everywhere that there is sexual immorality among you, and sexual immorality of such a kind which does not even exist among the Gentiles, so that someone has the wife of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you are inflated with pride, and should you not rather have mourned, so that the one who has done this deed would be removed from your midst?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For although I am absent in body but present in spirit, I have already passed judgment on the one who has done this in this way, as if I were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and my spirit, together with the power of our Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>I have decided to hand over such a person to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, in order that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Clean out the old leaven in order that you may be a new batch of dough, just as you are unleavened. For Christ our Passover has been sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>So then, let us celebrate the feast, not with the old leaven or with the leaven of wickedness and sinfulness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote to you in the letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>By no means did I mean the sexually immoral people of this world or the greedy people and swindlers or idolaters, since then you would have to depart out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But now I have written to you not to associate with any so-called brother, if he is a sexually immoral person or a greedy person or an idolater or an abusive person or a drunkard or a swindler—with such a person not even to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what is it to me to judge those outside? Should you not judge those inside?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>But those outside God will judge. Remove the evil person ˻from among yourselves˼.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Does anyone among you, if he has a matter against someone else, dare to go to court before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if by you the world is judged, are you unworthy of the most insignificant courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Do you not know that we will judge angels, not to mention ordinary matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>Therefore, if you have courts with regard to ordinary matters, do you seat these despised people in the church?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I say this to your shame. So is there not anyone wise among you who will be able to render a decision between his brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But brother goes to court with brother, and this before unbelievers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Therefore it is already completely a loss for you that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>But you wrong and defraud, and do this to brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! Neither sexually immoral people, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor passive homosexual partners, nor dominant homosexual partners,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor thieves, nor greedy persons, not drunkards, not abusive persons, not swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And some of you were these things, but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are permitted for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are permitted for me, but I will not be controlled by anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Food is for the stomach, and the stomach for food, but God will abolish ˻both of them˼. Now the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>And God both raised up the Lord and will raise us up by his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Therefore, shall I take away the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For it says, “The two will become one flesh.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a person commits is outside his body, but the one who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God with your body.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning the things about which you wrote: “It is good for a man not to touch a woman.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>But because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>The husband must fulfill his obligation to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife does not have authority over her own body, but her husband does. And likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but his wife does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not defraud one another, except perhaps by agreement, for a time, in order that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then you should be ˻together˼ again, lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self control.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But I say this as a concession, not as a command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>I wish all people could be like myself, but each one has his own gift from God, one in this way and another in that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>Now I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain as I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>To the married I command—not I, but the Lord—a wife must not separate from her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>But if indeed she does separate, she must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>Now to the rest I say—not the Lord—if any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>And if any wife has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her, she must not divorce her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother, since otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>But if the unbeliever leaves, let him leave. The brother or the sister is not bound in such cases. But God has called you in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.16'>For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.17'>But to each one as the Lord has apportioned. As God has called each one, thus let him live—and thus I order in all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.18'>Was anyone called after being circumcised? He must not undo his circumcision. Was anyone called in uncircumcision? He must not become circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.19'>Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Each one in the calling in which he was called—in this he should remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>Were you called while a slave? Do not let it be a concern to you. But if indeed you are able to become free, rather make use of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>For the one who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord’s freedperson. Likewise the one who is called while free is a slave of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.23'>You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.24'>Each one in the situation in which he was called, brothers—in this he should remain with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.25'>Now concerning virgins I do not have a command from the Lord, but I am giving an opinion as one shown mercy by the Lord to be trustworthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.26'>Therefore, I consider this to be good because of the impending distress, that it is good for a man to be thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.27'>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek release. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.28'>But if you marry, you have not sinned, and if the virgin marries, she has not sinned. But such people will have affliction in the flesh, and I would spare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.29'>But I say this, brothers: the time is shortened, that from now on even those who have wives should be as if they do not have wives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.30'>and those who weep as if they do not weep, and those who rejoice as if they do not rejoice, and those who buy as if they do not possess,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.31'>and those who make use of the world as if they do not make full use of it. For the present form of this world is passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.32'>But I want you to be free from care. The unmarried person cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.33'>But the one who is married cares for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>and he is divided. And the unmarried woman or the virgin cares for the things of the Lord, in order that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But the married woman cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>Now I am saying this for your own benefit, not that I may put a restriction on you, but to promote appropriate and devoted service to the Lord without distraction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>But if anyone thinks he is behaving dishonorably concerning his virgin, if she is past her prime and it ought to be thus, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin. Let them marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>But he who stands firm in his heart, not having necessity, but has authority concerning his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin, he will do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So then, the one who marries his own virgin does well, and the one who does not marry her will do better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A wife is bound for as long a time as her husband lives. But if her husband ˻dies˼, she is free to marry whomever she wishes, only in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.40'>But she is happier if she remains thus, according to my opinion—and I think I have the Spirit of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.1'>Now concerning food sacrificed to idols, we know that “we all have knowledge.” Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.2'>If anyone thinks he knows anything, he has not yet known as it is necessary to know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.3'>But if anyone loves God, this one is known by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.4'>Therefore, concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that “an idol is nothing in the world” and that “there is no God except one.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.5'>For even if after all there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many gods and many lords,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.6'>yet to us there is one God, the Father,from whom are all things, and we are for him,and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ,through whom are all things, and we are through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.7'>But this knowledge is not in everyone. But some, being accustomed until now to the idol, eat this food as food sacrificed to idols, and their conscience, because it is weak, is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.8'>But food does not bring us close to God. Neither if we do not eat do we lack, nor if we do eat do we have more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.9'>But watch out lest somehow this right of yours becomes a cause for stumbling to the weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.10'>For if someone should see you who has knowledge reclining for a meal in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, because it is weak, be strengthened so that he eats the food sacrificed to idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.11'>For the one who is weak—the brother for whom Christ died—is destroyed by your knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.12'>Now if you sin in this way against the brothers and wound their conscience, which is weak, you sin against Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.13'>Therefore, if food causes my brother to sin, I will never eat meat ˻forever˼, in order that I may not cause my brother to sin.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.1'>Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.2'>If to others I am not an apostle, yet indeed I am to you, for you are my seal of apostleship in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.3'>My defense to those who examine me is this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.4'>Do we not have the right to eat and drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.5'>Do we not have the right to take along a sister as wife, like the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.6'>Or do only I and Barnabas not have the right ˻to refrain from working˼?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.7'>Who ever serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it? Or who shepherds a flock and does not drink from the milk of the flock?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.8'>I am not saying these things according to a human perspective. Or does the law not also say these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.9'>For in the law of Moses it is written, “You must not muzzle an ox while it is threshing.” It is not about oxen God is concerned, is it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.10'>Or doubtless does he speak ˻for our sake˼? For it is written ˻for our sake˼, because the one who plows ought to plow in hope and the one who threshes ought to do so in hope of a share.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.11'>If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too great a thing if we reap material things from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.12'>If others share this right over you, do we not do so even more? Yet we have not made use of this right, but we endure all things, in order that we may not cause any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.13'>Do you not know that those performing the holy services eat the things from the temple, and those attending to the altar have a share with the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.14'>In the same way also the Lord ordered those who proclaim the gospel to live from the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.15'>But I have not made use of any of these rights. And I am not writing these things in order that it may be thus with me. For it would be better to me rather to die than for anyone to deprive me of my reason for boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.16'>For if I proclaim the gospel, it is not to me a reason for boasting, for necessity is imposed on me. For woe is to me if I do not proclaim the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.17'>For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward, but if I do so unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a stewardship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.18'>What then is my reward? That when I proclaim the gospel, I may offer the gospel free of charge, in order not to make full use of my right in the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.19'>For although I am free from all people, I have enslaved myself to all, in order that I may gain more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.20'>I have become like a Jew to the Jews, in order that I may gain the Jews. To those under the law I became as under the law (although I myself am not under the law) in order that I may gain those under the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.21'>To those outside the law I became as outside the law (although I am not outside the law of God, but subject to the law of Christ) in order that I may gain those outside the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.22'>To the weak I became weak, in order that I may gain the weak. I have become all things to all people, in order that by all means I may save some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.23'>I do all this for the sake of the gospel, in order that I may become a participant with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.24'>Do you not know that those who run in the stadium all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.25'>And everyone who competes exercises self-control in all things. Thus those do so in order that they may receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.26'>Therefore I run in this way, not as running aimlessly; I box in this way, not as beating the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.27'>But I discipline my body and subjugate it, lest somehow after preaching to others, I myself should become disqualified.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.1'>For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all went through the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.2'>and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.3'>and all ate the same spiritual food,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.4'>and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.5'>But God was not pleased with the majority of them, for they were struck down in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.6'>Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we should not be desirers of evil things, just as those also desired them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.7'>and not become idolaters, as some of them did, just as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.8'>nor commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed sexual immorality, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.9'>nor put Christ to the test, as some of them tested him, and were destroyed by snakes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.10'>nor grumble, just as some of them grumbled, and were destroyed by the destroyer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.11'>Now these things happened to those people as an example, but are written for our instruction, on whom the ends of the ages have come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.12'>Therefore, the one who thinks that he stands must watch out lest he fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.13'>Temptation has not come upon you except what is common to humanity. But God is faithful, who will not permit you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but will also make a way out together with the temptation, so that you may be able to endure it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.14'>Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.15'>I am speaking as to sensible people; you judge what I am saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.16'>The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.17'>Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all share from the one bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.18'>Consider Israel according to the flesh: are not the ones who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.19'>Therefore, what am I saying? That food sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.20'>No, but that the things which they sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to become sharers with demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.21'>You are not able to drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You are not able to share the table of the Lord and the table of demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.22'>Or are we attempting to provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than he is, are we?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.23'>All things are permitted, but not all things are profitable. All things are permitted, but not all things build up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.24'>Let no one seek ˻his own good˼ but the good of the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.25'>Eat everything that is sold in the meat market, ˻asking no questions˼ for the sake of the conscience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.26'>for “the earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.27'>If any of the unbelievers invites you, and you want to go, eat everything that is set before you, ˻asking no questions˼ for the sake of the conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.28'>But if someone says to you, “This is offered to idols,” do not eat it, for the sake of that one who informed you and the conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.29'>Now I am not speaking about your own conscience, but the conscience of the other person. For why is my freedom judged by another’s conscience?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.30'>If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.31'>Therefore, whether you eat or you drink or whatever you do, do all things for the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.32'>˻Give no offense˼ both to Jews and to Greeks and to the church of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.33'>just as I also please all people in all things, not seeking my own benefit, but the benefit of the many, in order that they may be saved.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.11'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.1'>Become imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.2'>Now I praise you that you remember me in all things, and just as I handed over to you the traditions, you hold fast to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.3'>But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and the head of Christ is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.4'>Every man who prays or prophesies while having something on his head dishonors his head,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.5'>but every woman who prays or prophesies with uncovered head dishonors her head, for she is one and the same with the one whose head is shaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.6'>For if a woman does not cover herself, let her hair be shorn off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her head shorn or shaved, let her cover her head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.7'>For indeed a man ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.8'>For man is not from woman, but woman from man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.9'>For indeed man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.10'>Because of this, the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, on account of the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.11'>Nevertheless, neither is woman anything apart from man, nor is man anything apart from woman in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.12'>For just as the woman is from the man, thus also the man is through the woman. But all thingsare from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.13'>You judge ˻for yourselves˼: is it fitting for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.14'>And does not nature itself teach you that a man, if he wears long hair, it is a dishonor to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.15'>But a woman, if she wears long hair, it is her glory, because her hair is given to her for a covering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.16'>But if anyone is disposed to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.17'>But in giving this instruction I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.18'>For in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.19'>For indeed it is necessary that there be factions among you, in order that those who are approved may become evident among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.20'>Therefore, when you come together in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.21'>For when you eat it, each one of you goes ahead to take his own supper, and one is hungry and another is drunk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.22'>For do you not have houses for eating and drinking? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who do not have anything? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.23'>For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was betrayed, took bread,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.24'>and after he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.25'>Likewise also the cup, after they had eaten, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.26'>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.27'>So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.28'>But let a person examine himself, and in this way let him eat from the bread and let him drink from the cup.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.29'>For the one who eats and drinks, if he does not recognize the body, eats and drinks judgment against himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.30'>Because of this, many are weak and sick among you, and quite a few ˻have died˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.31'>But if we were evaluating ourselves, we would not be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.32'>But if we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined, in order that we will not be condemned with the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.33'>So then, my brothers, when you come together in order to eat the Lord’s supper, wait for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.34'>If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And I will give directions about the remaining matters whenever I come.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.1'>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.2'>You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to the speechless idols, however you were led.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.3'>Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is accursed,” and no one is able to say “Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.4'>Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.5'>and there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.6'>and there are varieties of activities, but the same God, who works all things in all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.7'>But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is beneficial to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.8'>For to one is given a word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another a word of knowledge by the same Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.9'>to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.10'>and to another ˻miraculous powers˼, and to another prophecy, and to another distinguishing of spirits, to another kinds of tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.11'>But in all these things one and the same Spirit is at work, distributing to each one individually just as he wishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.12'>For just as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, although they are many, are one body, thus also Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.13'>For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free persons, and all were made to drink one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.14'>For the body is not one member, but many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.15'>If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,” not because of this is it not a part of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.16'>And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body, not because of this is it not a part of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.17'>If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.18'>But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body just as he wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.19'>And if they all were one member, where would the body be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>But now there are many members, but one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>Now the eye is not able to say to the hand, “I do not have need of you,” or again, the head to the feet, “I do not have need of you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>But by much more the members of the body which are thought to be weaker are necessary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>and the parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor, and our unpresentable parts come to have more abundant presentability,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>but our presentable parts do not have need of this. Yet God composed the body by giving more abundant honor to the part which lacked it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>in order that there not be a division in the body, but the members would have the same concern for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer together; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Now you are the body of Christ, and members ˻of it individually˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>and whom God has appointed in the church: first, apostles, second, prophets, third, teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, kinds of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.29'>Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all are workers of miracles, are they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.30'>Not all have gifts of healing, do they? Not all speak with tongues, do they? Not all interpret, do they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.31'>But strive for the greater gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a ringing brass gong or a clashing cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>And if I have the gift of prophecy and I know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>And if I parcel out all my possessions, and if I hand over my body in order that I may boast, but do not have love, it benefits me nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>Love is patient, love is kind, love is not jealous, it does not boast, it does not become conceited,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>it does not behave dishonorably, it˻is not selfish˼, it does not become angry, it does not keep a record of wrongs,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.6'>it does not rejoice at unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>Love never ends. But if there are prophecies, they will pass away. If there are tongues, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>For we know in part and we prophesy in part,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>but whenever the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I set aside the things of a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.12'>For now we see through a mirror ˻indirectly˼, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know completely, just as I have also been completely known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.13'>And now these three things remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Pursue love, and strive for spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God, because no one understands, but by the Spirit he speaks mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But the one who prophesies speaks to people edification and encouragement and consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one who prophesies edifies the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>Now I want you all to speak with tongues, but even more that you may prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks with tongues, unless he interprets, in order that the church may receive edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with tongues, how do I benefit you, unless I speak to you either with a revelation or with knowledge or with a prophecy or with a teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>Likewise, the inanimate things which produce a sound, whether flute or lyre, if they do not produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the lyre?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>For indeed, if the trumpet produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare for battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>And so you through the tongue, unless you produce a clear message, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are probably so many kinds of languages in the world, and none without meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a barbarian to the one who is speaking, and the one who is speaking will be a barbarian in my judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>In this way also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek for the edification of the church, in order that you may abound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Therefore the one who speaks in a tongue must pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>˻Therefore what should I do˼? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will also sing praise with my mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>For otherwise, if you praise in your spirit, how will the one who fills the place of the outsider say the “amen” at your thanksgiving, because he does not know what you are saying?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For indeed you are giving thanks well, but the other person is not edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I give thanks to God that I speak with tongues more than all of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>but in the church I prefer to speak five words with my mind, in order that I may instruct other people, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brothers, do not become children in your understanding, but with respect to wickedness be as a child, and in your understanding be mature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the law it is written:“By those who speak a foreign languageand by the lips of othersI will speak to this people,and not even in this way will they obey me,”says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>So then, tongues are for a sign not to those who believe, but to unbelievers, but prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>Therefore, if the whole church comes together at the same time and all speak with tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>the secret things of his heart become evident, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God, proclaiming, “God is truly among you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>˻Therefore what should you do˼, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. All things must be done for edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If anyone speaks in a tongue, it must be on one occasion two or at most three, and ˻one after the other˼, and one must interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there is no interpreter, he must be silent in the church, but let him speak to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Let two or three prophets speak, and the others evaluate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>And if something is revealed to another who is seated, the first must be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For you are all able to prophesy ˻in turn˼, in order that all may learn and all may be encouraged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not a God of disorder but of peace.As in all the churches of the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>the women must be silent in the churches, for it is not permitted for them to speak, but they must be in submission, just as the law also says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>But if they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>Or has the word of God gone out from you, or has it come to you only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, he should recognize that the things which I am writing to you are a command of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if anyone ignores this, he is ignored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>So then, my brothers, desire to prophesy, and do not prevent speaking with tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>But let all things be done decently and according to proper procedure.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Now I make known to you, brothers, the gospel which I proclaimed to you, which you have also received, in which you also stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>by which you are also being saved, if you hold fast to the message I proclaimed to you, unless you believed to no purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For I passed on to you ˻as of first importance˼ what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>and that he was buried, and that he was raised up on the third day according to the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, the majority of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>and last of all, as it were to one born at the wrong time, he appeared also to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles, not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me has not been in vain, but I labored even more than all of them, and not I, but the grace of God with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>Therefore whether I or those, in this way we preached, and in this way you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>Now if Christ is preached as raised up from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, Christ has not been raised either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>But if Christ has not been raised, then both our preaching is in vain, and your faith is in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>And also we are found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if after all, then, the dead are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead are not raised, Christ has not been raised either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>But if Christ has not been raised, your faith is empty; you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>And as a further result, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If ˻we have put our hope˼ in Christ in this life only, we are of all people most pitiable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For since through a man came death, also through a man came the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But each in his own group: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ’s at his coming,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>then the end, when he hands over the kingdom to the God and Father, when he has abolished all rule and all authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For it is necessary for him to reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy to be abolished is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>For “he subjected all things under his feet.” But when it says “all things” are subjected, it is clear that the one who subjected all things to him is not included.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>But whenever all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself also will be subjected to the one who subjected all things to him, in order that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Otherwise, why do they do it, those who are being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why indeed are they being baptized on behalf of them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>And why are we in danger every hour?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Sober up correctly and ˻stop sinning˼, for some have no knowledge of God—I say this to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what sort of body do they come?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>Foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>And what you sow is not the body which it will become, but you sow the bare seed, whether perhaps of wheat or of some of the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>But God gives to it a body just as he wishes, and to each one of the seeds its own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>Not all flesh is the same, but there is one flesh of human beings, and another flesh of animals, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>and heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly bodiesis of one kind, and the glory of the earthly bodiesis of another kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars, for star differs from star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>Thus also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>Thus also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>But the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>As the one who is made of earth, so also are those who are made of earth, and as the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>And just as we have borne the image of the one who is made of earth, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>But I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God, nor can corruption inherit incorruptibility.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Behold, I tell you a mystery: we will not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>in a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For it is necessary for this perishable body to put on incorruptibility, and this mortal body to put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>But whenever this perishable body puts on incorruptibility and this mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will take place:“Death is swallowed up in victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>Where, O death, is your victory?Where, O death, is your sting?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>So then, my dear brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.16'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.1'>Now concerning the collection for the saints: just as I gave directions about it to the churches of Galatia, so you do also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.2'>On the first day of the week, each one of you ˻put aside˼something, saving up ˻to whatever extent he has prospered˼, in order that whenever I come, at that time collections do not take place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.3'>And whenever I arrive, whomever you approve by letters, I will send these to take your gift to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.4'>And if it is worthwhile for me to go also, they will travel with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.5'>But I will come to you whenever I go through Macedonia (for I am going through Macedonia),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.6'>and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I may go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.7'>For I do not want to see you now in passing, for I hope to remain some time with you, if the Lord allows it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.8'>But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.9'>for a great and effective door has opened for me, and there are many opponents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.10'>But if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without cause to fear, for he is carrying out the Lord’s work, as I also am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.11'>Therefore do not let anyone disdain him, but send him on his way in peace in order that he may come to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.12'>Now concerning Apollos our brother, I urged him many times that he should come to you with the brothers, and he was not at all willing that he should come now, but he will come whenever he has an opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.13'>Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act courageously, be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.14'>All your actions must be done in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.15'>Now I urge you, brothers—you know about the household of Stephanas, that they are the first fruits of Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the ministry for the saints—</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.16'>that you also be subject to such people, and to all those who work together and labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.17'>Now I rejoice over the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because these make up for your absence,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God that is in Corinth, together with all the saints who are in all Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in all affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, thus through Christ our comfort overflows also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort that is at work in the patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>And our hope for you is firm, because we know that as you are sharers in the sufferings, so also you will be sharers in the comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning our affliction that happened in the province of Asia, that we were burdened to an extraordinary degree, beyond our strength, so that we were in despair even of living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, so that we would not be putting confidence in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>who delivered us from so great a risk of death, and will deliver us, in whom we have put our hope that he will also deliver us again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>while you also join in helping ˻on our behalf˼ by prayer, so that thanks may be given ˻on our behalf˼ by many persons for this gracious gift given to us through the help of many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For our reason for boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you, in sincerity and purity of motive from God and not in merely human wisdom, but by the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we are not writing anything else to you except what you can read or also understand. But I hope that you will understand ˻completely˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>just as you have also understood us in part, that we are your reason for boasting, just as you are also ours in the day of our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And with this confidence, I was wanting to come to you previously, in order that you may have a second proof of my goodwill,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>and through you to go to Macedonia, and to come to you again from Macedonia, and to be sent on my way by you to Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>Therefore, when I was wanting to do this, perhaps then was I making use of vacillation? Or was I deciding what I was deciding according to the flesh, in order that with me my “yes” may be “yes” and my “no” may be “no” at the same time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>But God is faithful, so that our word to you is not “yes” and “no.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, the one who was proclaimed among you by us, by me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become “yes” and “no,” but has become “yes” in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>For as many as are the promises of God, in him they are “yes”; therefore also through him is the “amen” to the glory of God through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>Now the one who establishes us together with you in Christ and who anoints us is God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>who also sealed us and gave the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>But I call upon God as witness against my life, that in order to spare you, I did not come again to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are fellow workers for your joy, because by faith you stand firm.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>For I have decided this for myself, not to come to you again in sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I cause you sorrow, then who will make me glad except the one who is caused to be sad by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I wrote this very thing in order that when I came, I would not experience sorrow from those who ought to have made me glad, because I have confidence about you all, that my joy ˻belongs to all of you˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For out of great distress and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not so that you may be caused to be sad, but so that you may know the love that I have especially for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>But if anyone has caused sorrow, he has not caused me sorrow, but ˻to some degree˼—˻in order not to say too much˼—to all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>This punishment by the majority is sufficient for such a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>So then, you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest somehow this person should be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Therefore I urge you to confirm your love for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>Because for this reason also I wrote, in order that I could know your proven character, whether you are obedient in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>Now to whomever you forgive anything, I also do; for indeed, whatever I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is˻for your sake˼ in the presence of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>in order that we may not be exploited by Satan (for we are not ignorant of his schemes).</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Now when I arrived in Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door was opened for me by the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I did not experience rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother, but saying farewell to them, I departed for Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ, and who reveals the fragrance of the knowledge of him through us in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>to those on the one hand an odor from death to death, and to those on the other hand a fragrance from life to life. And who is qualified for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we are not like the majority who peddle the word of God, but as from pure motives—but as from God—we speak before God in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we, like some, need letters of recommendation to you or from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>You are our letter, inscribed on our hearts, known and read by all people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>revealing that you are a letter of Christ, delivered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets but on tablets of human hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>Now we possess such confidence through Christ toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>who also makes us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit, for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>But if the ministry of death in letters carved on stone came with glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to look intently into the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, which was transitory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>how will the ministry of the Spirit not be even more with glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, by much more will the ministry of righteousness overflow with glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For indeed what had been glorified has not been glorified in this case, on account of the glory that surpasses it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if what was transitory came with glory, by much more what remains is with glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Therefore, because we have such a hope, we use much boldness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>and not as Moses used to place a veil over his face, in order that the sons of Israel would not stare at the end of what was transitory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>But their minds were hardened. For until this very day, the same veil remains upon the reading of the old covenant, not being uncovered, because it is done away with in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But until today, whenever Moses is read aloud, a veil lies upon their heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>but whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>And we all, with unveiled face, reflecting the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory into glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Because of this, since we have this ministry, just as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>but we have renounced shameful hidden things, not behaving with craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but with the open proclamation of the truth commending ourselves to every person’s conscience before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>But if indeed our gospel is veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>among whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that they would not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for the sake of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>For God who said, “Light will shine out of darkness,” is the one who has shined in our hearts for the enlightenment of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>But we have this treasure in earthenware jars, in order that the extraordinary degree of the power may be from God and not from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>always carrying around the death of Jesus in our body, in order that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For we who are alive are continually being handed over to death because of Jesus, in order that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So then, death is at work in us, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>But because we have the same spirit of faith in accordance with what is written, “I believed, therefore I spoke,” we also believe, therefore we also speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us together with Jesus and present us together with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For all these things˻are for your sake˼, in order that the grace that is increasing through the many may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>Therefore we do not lose heart, but even if our outer person is being destroyed, yet our inner person is being renewed day after day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For our momentary light affliction is producing in us an eternal weight of glory ˻beyond all measure and proportion˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>because we are not looking at what is seen, but what is not seen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is not seen is eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that if our earthly house, the tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by hands, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For indeed, in this house we groan, because we desire to put on our dwelling from heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>if indeed, even after we have taken it off, we will not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For indeed we who are in this tent groan, being burdened ˻for this reason, that˼ we do not want to be unclothed, but to be clothed, in order that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>Now the one who has prepared us for this very thingis God, who has given us the down payment, the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>Therefore, although we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord—</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>for we live by faith, not by sight—</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>so we are confident and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Therefore indeed we have as our ambition, whether at home in the body or absent from the body, to be acceptable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, in order that each one may receive back the things through the body according to what he has done, whether good or bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Therefore, because we know the fear of the Lord, we are attempting to persuade people, but we are revealed to God, and I hope to be revealed in your consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>We are not commending ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to boast about us, in order that you may have an answer for those who boast in appearance and not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For if we are out of our senses, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one died for all; as a result all died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>And he died for all, in order that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for the one who died for them and was raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>So then, from now on we know no one ˻from a human point of view˼, if indeed we have known Christ ˻from a human point of view˼, but now we know him this way no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, new things have come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>And all these thingsare from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ, and who has given us the ministry of reconciliation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>Therefore we are ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as if God were imploring you through us. We beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>He made the one who did not know sin to be sin on our behalf, in order that we could become the righteousness of God in him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>Now because we are fellow workers, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>For he says,“At the acceptable time I heard you,and in the day of salvation I helped you.”Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>We are giving no one an occasion for taking offense in anything, in order that our ministry will not have fault found with it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>but commending ourselves as servants of God in every way, in much endurance, in afflictions, in distresses, in difficulties,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>in beatings, in prisons, in disturbances, in troubles, in sleepless nights, in going hungry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love without hypocrisy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>in the word of truth, in the power of God, with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and left hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>through glory and dishonor, through slander and good repute, regarded as deceivers and yet truthful,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as unknown and yet known completely, as dying, and behold, we go on living, as disciplined, and yet not put to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>as grieving, but always rejoicing, as poor, but making many rich, as having nothing, and possessing everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>˻We have spoken freely and openly˼ to you, Corinthians; our heart is open wide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your affections.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>Now the same wayin exchange (I am speaking as to children), you open wide your hearts also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers, for what participation is there between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>And what agreement does Christ have with Beliar? Or what share does a believer have with an unbeliever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said,“I will live in them and will walk about among them,and I will be their God and they will be my people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Therefore “come out from their midstand be separate,” says the Lord,“and do not touch what is unclean,and I will welcome you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>and I will be a father to you,and you will be sons and daughters to me,”says the all-powerful Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Therefore since we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of body and spirit, accomplishing holiness in the fear of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>But God, who comforts the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted among you, because he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>For if indeed I grieved you by my letter, I do not regret it (even if I did regret it), for I see that that letter grieved you, even though for ˻a short time˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>Now I do not rejoice that you were grieved, but that you were grieved to repentence. For you were grieved according to the will of God, so that you suffered loss in no way through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For grief according to the will of God brings about a repentence leading to salvation, not to be regretted, but worldly grief brings about death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>For behold how much diligence this very thing, being grieved according to the will of God, has brought about in you: what defense of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! In everything you have demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>Consequently, even if I wrote to you, it was not because of the one who did wrong or because of the one who had been wronged, but in order that your diligence ˻on our behalf˼ might be revealed to you before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>Because of this we have been encouraged, and in addition to our encouragement, we rejoiced much more over the joy of Titus, because his spirit had been refreshed by all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>For if I have boasted anything to him about you, I have not been put to shame, but as I have spoken everything to you in truth, thus also our boasting to Titus ˻has proven to be true˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And his affection for you is all the more when he remembers the obedience of all of you as you welcomed him with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>I rejoice, because in everything I am completely confident in you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>Now we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>that with a great ordeal of affliction, the abundance of their joy and the extreme depth of their poverty have overflowed to the wealth of their generosity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>I testify that they gave according to their ability, and beyond their ability, by their own choice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>requesting of us with much exhortation the favor and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>and not just as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us, by the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>So we urged Titus that, just as he had previously begun it, thus he would also complete for you this act of grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>But just as you excel in everything—in faith and in speaking and in knowledge and with all diligence and in the love from us that is in you—so may you excel in this grace also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I am not saying this as a command, but proving the genuineness of your love by means of the diligence of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was rich, for your sake he became poor, in order that you, by his poverty, may become rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>And I am giving an opinion in this matter, because this is profitable for you who not only began previously, a year ago, to do something, but also to want to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>So now also complete the doing of it, in order that just as you have the eagerness to want to do it, thus also you may complete it from what you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if the eagerness is present ˻according to what one has˼, it is acceptable not ˻according to what one does not have˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>For this is not that for others there may be relief, and for you difficult circumstances, but as a matter of equality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>At the present time your abundance will be for their need, in order that their abundance may also be for your need, so that there may be equality,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>just as it is written, “The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>But thanks be to God, who has put in the heart of Titus the same devotion ˻on your behalf˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>because he not only welcomed our request, but being very earnest, by his own choice he went out to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>And we have sent at the same time with him the brother whose praise in the gospel has become known throughout all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>And not only this, but he was also chosen by the churches as our traveling companion together with this gift that is being administered by us to the glory of the Lord himself and to show our readiness to help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>We are trying to avoid this, lest anyone should find fault with us in this abundant gift that is being administered by us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>For we are taking into consideration what is honorable not only before the Lord, but also before people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>And we are sending with them our brother whom we have tested many times in many things that he is diligent, but now much more diligent because of his great confidence in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>If there is a question concerning Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. If there is a question concerning our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Therefore show to them the proof of your love and our boasting about you ˻openly before˼ the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>For it is unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the ministry to the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>because I know your readiness to help, concerning which I keep on boasting to the Macedonians about you, that Achaia has been ready to help since last year, and your zeal has stirred up the majority of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you would not prove to be empty in this case, so that you may be prepared just as I was saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>lest somehow if Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared, we—˻not to speak of you˼—would be humiliated in connection with this project.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>Therefore I considered it necessary to urge the brothers that they should go on ahead to you and make arrangements in advance for your generous gift that was promised previously, so this would be prepared as a generous gift and not as grudgingly granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>Now the point is this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>Each one should give as he has decided in his heart, not ˻reluctantly˼ or from compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>And God is able to cause all grace to abound to you, so that in everything at all times, because you have enough of everything, you may overflow in every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>Just as it is written,“He scattered widely, he gave to the poor;his righteousness remains ˻forever˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>Now the one who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your seed, and will cause the harvest of your righteousness to grow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>being made rich in every way for all generosity, which is producing through us thanksgiving to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>because the service of this ministry is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but also is overflowing through many expressions of thanksgiving to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>Through the proven character of this service they will glorify God because of the submission of your confession to the gospel of Christ and the generosity of your participation toward them and toward everyone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>and they are longing for you in their prayers for you, because of the surpassing grace of God to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.15'>Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>Now I, Paul, appeal to you myself by the humility and gentleness of Christ, who ˻when I am present in person˼am humble among you, but when I am absent am bold toward you—</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>now I ask when I am present that I will not need to be bold with the confidence with which I propose to show boldness toward some who consider us as behaving according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For although we are living in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>for the weapons of our warfare are not merely human, but powerful to God for the tearing down of fortresses, tearing down arguments</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>and all pride that is raised up against the knowledge of God, and taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>And ˻we are ready˼ to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>You are looking at things according to appearance. If anyone is convinced he himself is Christ’s, he should consider this concerning himself again: that just as Christ himself is, so also are we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>For even if I boast somewhat more about our authority that the Lord gave us˻for building you up and not for tearing you down˼, I will not be put to shame,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>so that I do not want to appear as if I were terrifying you by my letters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>because it is said, “His letters are severe and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak and his speech is of no account.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>Let such a person consider this: that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, we will also be in ˻actions˼when we are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>For we do not dare to classify or to compare ourselves with some who commend themselves, but they themselves, when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, do not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>But we will not boast ˻beyond limits˼, but according to the measure of the assignment that God has assigned to us as a measure to reach even as far as you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we had not reached you, because we have reached even as far as you with the gospel of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>not boasting ˻beyond limits˼ in the labors of others, but having hope that as your faith is growing to be enlarged greatly by you according to our assignment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>so that we may proclaim the gospel in the regions that lie beyond you, and not boast in the things accomplished in the area assigned to someone else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>But “the one who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>For it is not the one commending himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.11'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>I wish that you would put up with me ˻in something a little foolish˼—but indeed you are putting up with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy, because I promised you in marriage to one husband, to present youas a pure virgin to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But I am afraid lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds may be led astray from the sincerity and the purity of devotion to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>For if the one who comes proclaims another Jesus whom we have not proclaimed, or you receive a different spirit which you did not receive, or a different gospel which you did not accept, you put up with it well enough!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>For I consider myself in no way to be inferior to the preeminent apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>But even if I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not in knowledge; certainly in everything we have made this clear to you in every way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself in order that you may be exalted, because I proclaimed the gospel of God to you without payment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I robbed other churches by accepting support from them for the ministry to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>And when I was present with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need, and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and will keep myself from being a burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting ˻of mine˼ will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.11'>˻Why˼? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>But what I am doing, I will also do, in order that I may remove the opportunity of those who want an opportunity, that they may be found just as also we are in what they are boasting about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.14'>And no wonder, for Satan himself disguises himself as an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>Therefore it is not a great thing if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>Again I say, do not let anyone think I am foolish. But indeed, if you do, accept me even as foolish, in order that I also may boast a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.17'>What I am saying in this project of boasting, I am not saying as the Lord would say, but as in foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.18'>Since many are boasting according to human standards, I also will boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.19'>For because you are wise, you put up with foolish people gladly!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>For you put up with it if someone enslaves you, if someone devours you, if someone takes advantage of you, if someone is presumptious toward you, if someone strikes you in the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.21'>I say this to my shame, namely, that we have been weak.But in whatever anyone dares to boast—I am speaking in foolishness—I also dare to boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.22'>Are they Hebrews? I am also! Are they Israelites? I am also! Are they descendants of Abraham? I am also!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.23'>Are they servants of Christ?—I am speaking as though I were beside myself—I am more so, with far greater labors, with far more imprisonments, with beatings to a much greater degree, in danger of death many times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.24'>Five times I received at the hands of the Jews forty lashes less one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.25'>Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I received a stoning. Three times I was shipwrecked. A day and a night I have spent in the deep water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.26'>I have been on journeys many times, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own people, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, in dangers because of false brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.27'>with toil and hardship, often in sleepless nights, with hunger and thirst, often going hungry, in cold and poorly clothed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.28'>Apart from these external things, there is the pressure on me every day of the anxiety about all the churches.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.30'>If it is necessary to boast, I will boast about˻the things related to my weakness˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.31'>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is blessed ˻forever˼, knows that I am not lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.32'>In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to take me into custody,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.1'>It is necessary to boast; it is not profitable, but I will proceed to visions and revelations of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.2'>I know a man in Christ fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know, God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.4'>that he was caught up to paradise and heard words not to be spoken, which it is not permitted for a person to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>On behalf of such a person I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>For if I want to boast, I will not be foolish, because I will be telling the truth, but I am refraining, so that no one can credit to me more than what he sees in me or hears anything from me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>even because of the extraordinary degree of the revelations. Therefore, so that I would not exalt myself, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan, in order that it would torment me so that I would not exalt myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>And he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, because the power is perfected in weakness.” Therefore rather I will boast most gladly in my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may reside in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>Therefore I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in calamities, in persecutions and difficulties for the sake of Christ, for whenever I am weak, then I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>I have become a fool! You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for I am in no way inferior to the preeminent apostles, even if I am nothing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>As we said before, and now I say again, if anyone is proclaiming a gospel to you contrary to what you have received, let him be accursed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>For am I now making an appeal to people or to God? Or am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>For I make known to you, brothers, the gospel that has been proclaimed by me, that it is not ˻of human origin˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>For you have heard about my former way of life in Judaism, that to an extraordinary degree I was persecuting the church of God, and trying to destroy it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>and was progressing in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my nation, because I was a far more zealous adherent of the traditions handed down by my forefathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>to reveal his Son in me, in order that I would proclaim the gospel about him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not consult with flesh and blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia and I returned again to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>but I did not see any others of the apostles except James, the brother of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>(Now the things which I am writing to you, behold, I assure you before God that I am not lying.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>Then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>but I was unknown ˻in person˼ to the churches of Judea that are in Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>and they were only hearing, “The one formerly persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith that formerly he was attempting to destroy,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>and they were glorifying God because of me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking along Titus also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>Now I went up there because of a revelation and laid out to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles, but in private to the influential people, lest somehow I was running, or had run, in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>But not even Titus who was with me, although he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>Now this was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, in order that they might enslave us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>to whom not even for an hour did we yield in subjection, in order that the truth of the gospel might remain continually with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>But from those ˻who were influential˼ (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me, ˻God does not show partiality˼)—for those who were influential added nothing to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>But these, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcision, just as Peter to the circumcision</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>(for the one who was at work through Peter for his apostleship to the circumcision was at work also through me for the Gentiles),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>and when James and Cephas and John—those thought to be pillars—acknowledged the grace given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, in order that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>They asked only that we should remember the poor, the very thing I was also eager to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>For before certain people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles, but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, because he was afraid of those who were of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>and the rest of the Jews also joined in this hypocrisy with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with them in their hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw that they were not being straightforward with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of them all, “If you, although you are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you try to compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>but knowing that a person is not justified by the works of the law, if not by faith in Jesus Christ, and we have believed in Christ Jesus so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law ˻no human being will be justified˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>But if while seeking to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also have been found to be sinners, then is Christ an agent of sin? May it never be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>For if I build up again these things which I destroyed, I show myself to be a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For through the law I died to the law, in order that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me, and that life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not declare invalid the grace of God, for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died to no purpose.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as having been crucified?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>I want only to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now trying to be made complete by the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>Have you suffered so many things for nothing—if indeed also it was for nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>Therefore does the one who gives you the Spirit and who works miracles among you do so by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>then understand that the ones ˻who have faith˼, these are sons of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the good news in advance to Abraham: “In you all the nations will be blessed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>So then, the ones who have faith are blessed together with Abraham who believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse, for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all the things that are written in the book of the law to do them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>Now it is clear that no one is justified in the sight of God by the law, because “the one who is righteous will live by faith.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>But the law is not from faith, but “the one who does these things will live by them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, because it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>in order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>Brothers, I am speaking according to a human perspective. Nevertheless, when the covenant of a man has been ratified, no one declares it invalid or adds additional provisions to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>Now to Abraham and to his descendant the promises were spoken. It does not say, “and to descendants,” as concerning many, but as concerning one, “and to your descendant,” who is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>Now I am saying this: the law, that came after four hundred and thirty years, does not revoke a covenant previously ratified by God, in order to nullify the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>For if the inheritance is from the law, it is no longer from the promise, but God graciously gave it to Abraham through the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Why then the law? It was added on account of transgressions, until the descendant should come to whom it had been promised, having been ordered through angels by the hand of a mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>Now the mediator is not for one, but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Therefore is the law opposed to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, certainly righteousness would have been from the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the scripture imprisoned all under sin, in order that the promise could be given by faith in Jesus Christ to those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>But before faith came, we were detained under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith was revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>So then, the law became our guardian until Christ, in order that we could be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But after faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>for as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>And if you are Christ’s, then you are descendants of Abraham, heirs according to the promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>Now I say, for as long a time as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he is master of everything,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>but he is under guardians and managers until the time set by his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>So also we, when we were children, we were enslaved under the elemental spirits of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>But when the fullness of time came, God sent out his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>in order that he might redeem those under the law, in order that we might receive the adoption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>And because you are sons, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying out, “Abba! (Father!),”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>so that you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, also an heir through God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>But at that time when you did not know God, you were enslaved to the things which by nature are not gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>But now, because you have come to know God, or rather have come to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental spirits? Do you want to be enslaved to them all over again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>You carefully observe days and months and seasons and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I am afraid for you, lest perhaps I have labored for you in vain!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>I ask you, brothers, become like me, because I also have become like you. You have done me no wrong!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>But you know that because of an illness of the flesh I proclaimed the gospel to you the first time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>And you did not despise or disdain what was a trial for you in my flesh, but you welcomed me like an angel of God, like Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>So where is your blessing? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>So then, have I become your enemy by being truthful to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>They zealously seek you, not commendably, but they want to exclude you, in order that you may seek them zealously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>But it is good to be sought zealously in good at all times, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My children, for whom I am having birth pains again, until Christ is formed in you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>But I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone because I am perplexed about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, you who are wanting to be under the law, do you not understand the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the female slave and one by the free woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>But the one by the female slave was born according to human descent, and the one by the free woman through the promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>which things are spoken allegorically, for these women are two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery, who is Hagar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is a slave with her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>But the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>For it is written,“Rejoice, O barren woman, who does not give birth to children;burst out and shout, you who do not have birth pains,because many are the children of the desolate woman,even more than those of the one who has a husband.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>But you, brothers, are children of the promise, just as Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>But just as at that time the child born according to human descent persecuted the child born according to the Spirit, so also now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>But what does the scripture say? “Drive out the female slave and her son, for the son of the female slave will never inherit with the son” of the free woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the female slave but of the free woman.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, therefore, and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>Look! I, Paul, tell you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>And again I testify to every man who becomes circumcised, that he is under obligation to keep the whole law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>You are estranged from Christ, you who are attempting to be justified by the law; you have fallen from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>For through the Spirit by faith we eagerly await the hope of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>This persuasion is not from the one who calls you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>A little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will think nothing different, but the one who is confusing you ˻will pay the penalty˼, whoever he may be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>Now, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>I wish that the ones who are disturbing you would also ˻castrate themselves˼!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not let your freedom become an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>For the whole law is fulfilled in one statement, namely, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>But I say, live by the Spirit, and you will never carry out the desire of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>For the flesh desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, for these are in opposition to one another, so that whatever you want, you may not do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are sexual immorality, impurity, licentiousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, factions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, things which I am telling you in advance, just as I said before, that the ones who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>gentleness, self control. Against such things there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>Now those ˻who belong to Christ Jesus˼ have crucified the flesh together with its feelings and its desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>If we live by the Spirit, we must also follow the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.26'>We must not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gal.6'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>Brothers, even if a person is caught in some trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a person in a spirit of humility, looking out for yourself, lest you also be tempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>Carry the burdens of one another, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>For if anyone thinks he is something although he is nothing, he is deceiving himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have a reason for boasting in himself alone, and not in someone else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>For each one will carry his own burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>Now the one who is taught the word must share in all good things with the one who teaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Do not be deceived: God is not to be mocked, for whatever a person sows, this he will also reap,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>because the one who sows to his own flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>And let us not grow weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap, if we do not give up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who belong to the household of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>As many as are wanting to make a good showing in the flesh, these are attempting to compel you to be circumcised, only so that they will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>For not even those who are circumcised observe the law themselves, but they want you to be circumcised in order that they may boast in your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>But as for me, may it never be that I boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.15'>For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.16'>And all those who follow this rule, peace and mercy be on them and on the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.17'>Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I carry on my body the marks of Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.2.1'>And you, ˻although you were dead˼ in your trespasses and sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.2'>in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit now working in the sons of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.3'>among whom also we all formerly lived in the desires of our flesh, doing the will of the flesh and of the mind, and we were children of wrath by nature, as also the rest of them were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.4'>But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.5'>and we being dead in trespasses, he made us alive together with Christ (by grace you are saved),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.6'>and raised us together and seated us together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.7'>in order that he might show in the coming ages the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness upon us in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.8'>For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.9'>it is not from works, so that no one can boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.10'>For we are his creation, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, so that we may walk in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.11'>Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, the so-called uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision in the flesh, made by hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'>that you were at that time apart from Christ, alienated from the citizenship of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, not having hope, and without God in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.13'>But now in Christ Jesus you, the ones who once were far away, have become near by the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'>For he himself is our peace, who made both one and broke down the dividing wall of the partition, the enmity, in his flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'>invalidating the law of commandments in ordinances, in order that he might create the two in himself into one new man, thus making peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'>and might reconcile both in one body to God through the cross, killing the enmity in himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'>And coming, he proclaimed the good news of peace to you who were far away and peace to the ones who were near,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'>because through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'>Consequently, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens of the saints and members of the household of God,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.3.3'>that according to revelation the mystery was made known to me, just as I wrote beforehand in brief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.4'>so that you may be able when you read to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.5'>(which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit):</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.6'>that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow sharers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.7'>of which I became a servant, according to the gift of God’s grace given to me, according to the working of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.8'>To me, the least of all the saints, was given this grace: to proclaim the good news of the fathomless riches of Christ to the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.9'>and to enlighten everyone as to what is the administration of the mystery hidden from the ages by God, who created all things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'>in order that the many-sided wisdom of God might be made known now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places through the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.11'>according to the purpose of the ages which he carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.12'>in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through faith in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.13'>Therefore I ask you not to be discouraged at my afflictions on behalf of you, which are your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'>On account of this, I bend my knees before the Father,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.3.16'>that he may grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner person,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.17'>that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith (you having been firmly rooted and established in love),</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.3.19'>and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, in order that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.20'>Now to the one who is able to do beyond all measure more than all that we ask or think, according to the power that is at work in us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.21'>to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord, exhort you to live in a manner worthy of the calling with which you were called:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'>with all humility and gentleness, with patience, putting up with one another in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'>being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.4'>one body and one Spirit (just as also you were called with one hope of your calling),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'>one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'>one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'>Now to each one of us was given this grace, according to the measure of Christ’s gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'>Therefore it says,“Ascending on high he led captivity captive;he gave gifts to men.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'>Now “he ascended,” what is it, except that he also descended to the lower regions of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'>The one who descended himself is also the one who ascended above all the heavens, in order that he might fill all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'>And he himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'>for the equipping of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for building up the body of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'>until we all reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to a measure of the maturity of the fullness of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>so that we may no longer be infants, tossed about by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching, by the trickery of people, by craftiness with reference to the scheming of deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow into him with reference to all things, who is the head, Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'>from whom the whole body, joined together and held together by every supporting ligament, according to the working by measure of each single part, the growth of the body makes for the building up of itself in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles walk: in the futility of their mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>being darkened in understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>who, becoming callous, gave themselves over to licentiousness, for the pursuit of all uncleanness in greediness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>But you did not learn Christ in this way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>if indeed you have heard about him, and you were taught by him (just as truth is in Jesus),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'>that you take off, according to your former way of life, the old man, who is being destroyed according to deceitful desires,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'>be renewed in the spirit of your mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>and put on the new man (in accordance with God), who is created in righteousness and holiness from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>Therefore, putting aside the lie, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor, because we are members of one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun set on your anger,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'>nor give place to the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>The one who steals must steal no longer, but instead must labor, working with his own hands what is good, so that he may have something to share with the one who has need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>˻No rotten word must proceed˼ from your mouth, but only something good for the building up of the need, in order that it may give grace to those who hear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>and do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>All bitterness, and rage, and wrath, and clamor, and abusive speech, must be removed from you, together with all wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'>But become kind toward one another, compassionate, forgiving one another, just as also God in Christ has forgiven you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>Therefore become imitators of God, as beloved children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>and live in love, just as also Christ loved us, and gave himself for us an offering and sacrifice to God for a fragrant smell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or greediness, must not even be named among you (as is fitting for saints),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>and obscenity, and foolish talk, or coarse jesting (which are not proper), but rather thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>For this you know ˻for certain˼, that every sexually immoral person, or unclean person, or greedy person (who is an idolater), does not have an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>Therefore do not be sharers with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>for you were formerly darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live like children of light</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>(for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>trying to learn what is well-pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>And do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather even expose them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>For it is shameful even to speak about the things being done by them in secret,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>but all things exposed by the light are made visible,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>for everything made visible is light. Therefore it says,Wake up, sleeper,and rise from the dead,and Christ will shine on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>Therefore, consider carefully how you live, not as unwise but as wise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>making the most of the time because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>Because of this do not become foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>And do not be drunk with wine (in which is dissipation), but be filled by the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and singing praise in your heart to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to the God and Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>being subject to one another ˻out of reverence for˼ Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>—wives to their own husbands as to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>because the husband is the head of the wife, as also Christ is the head of the church (he himself being the Savior of the body).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>But as the church is subject to Christ, thus also wives should be subject to their husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for her;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>in order that he might sanctify her by cleansing her with the washing of water by the word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>in order that he might present to himself the church glorious, not having a spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she may be holy and blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>Thus also husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. The one who loves his own wife loves himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as also Christ does the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>because we are members of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>(This mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>Only you also, each one of you, must thus love his own wife as himself, and the wife ˻must respect˼ her husband.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.6.9'>And masters, do the same things to them, giving up threats, knowing that both their Lord and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.10'>Finally, become strong in the Lord and in the might of his strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.11'>Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the strategems of the devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.12'>because our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.13'>Because of this, take up the full armor of God, in order that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>complete my joy, so that ˻you are in agreement˼, having the same love, united in spirit, ˻having one purpose˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>Do nothing according to selfish ambition or according to empty conceit, but in humility considering one another better than yourselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>each one of you not looking out for ˻his own interests˼, but also each of you looking out for˻the interests˼ of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>Think this in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>who, existing in the form of God,did not consider being equal with God something to be grasped,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>but emptied himselfby taking the form of a slave,by becoming in the likeness of people.And being found in appearance like a man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>he humbled himselfby becoming obedient to the point of death,that is, death on a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Therefore also God exalted himand graciously granted him the name above every name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>so that at the name of Jesusevery knee should bow,of those in heaven and of those on earth and of those under the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>and every tongue confessthat Jesus Christ is Lord,to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>Therefore my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>For the one at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure, is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>Do all things without grumbling and disputing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>in order that you may become blameless and innocent, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as stars in the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>holding fast to the word of life, for a source of pride to me in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and rejoice with all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>And in the same way also you rejoice and rejoice with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I also may be encouraged when I know ˻your circumstances˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I have no one like-minded who will sincerely be concerned about ˻your circumstances˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For they all seek ˻their own interests˼, not those of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But you know his proven character, that like a child with a father he served with me for the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see ˻my circumstances˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>And I am convinced in the Lord that I myself will arrive shortly also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>But I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, but your messenger and servant of my need,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>because he was longing for all of you and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>For indeed he was sick, coming near to death, but God had mercy on him and not on him only, but also on me, so that I would not have grief upon grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>Therefore I am sending him with special urgency, in order that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less anxious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Therefore welcome him in the Lord with all joy, and consider such people highly honored,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because on account of the work of Christ he came near to the point of death, risking his life in order that ˻he might make up for your inability to serve me˼.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is not troublesome to me, but is a safeguard for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the mutilation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For we are the circumcision, the ones who worship by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and do not put confidence in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>although I could have confidence even in the flesh.If anyone else thinks to put confidence in the flesh, I can do so more:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>˻circumcised on the eighth day˼, from the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born from Hebrews, according to the law a Pharisee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>according to zeal persecuting the church, according to the righteousness in the law being blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But whatever things were gain to me, these things I have considered loss because of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>˻More than that˼, I even consider all things to be loss because of the surpassing greatness of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for the sake of whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and consider them dung, in order that I may gain Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>and may be found in him, not having my righteousness which is from the law, but which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God on the basis of faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>so that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>if somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not that I have already received this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on if indeed I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brothers, I do not consider myself to have laid hold of it. But I do one thing, forgetting the things behind and straining toward the things ahead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Therefore as many as are perfect, ˻let us hold this opinion˼, and if you think anything differently, God will reveal this also to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>Only to what we have attained, to the same hold on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Become fellow imitators of me, brothers, and observe those who walk in this way, just as you have us as an example.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>For many live, of whom I spoke about to you many times, but now speak about even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>whose end is destruction, whose God is the stomach, and whose glory is in their shame, the ones who think on earthly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>For our commonwealth exists in heaven, from which also we eagerly await a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>who will transform our humble body to be conformed to his glorious body, in accordance with the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>So then, my beloved and greatly desired brothers, my joy and crown, thus stand firm in the Lord, dear friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I appeal to Euodia and I appeal to Syntyche ˻to be in agreement˼ in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>Yes, I ask also you, true yokefellow, help them, who struggled along with me in the gospel with both Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let your gentleness be made known to all people. The Lord is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are right, whatever things are pure, whatever things are pleasing, whatever things are commendable, if there is any excellence of character and if anything praiseworthy, think about these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>And the things which you have learned and received and heard about and seen in me, practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last ˻you have renewed your concern for me˼, for whom also you were thinking, but you had no opportunity to express it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Not that I speak from need, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know how both ˻to make do with little˼ and I know how˻to have an abundance˼. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both ˻to have an abundance˼ and to go without.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I am able to do all things by the one who strengthens me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>Nevertheless you have done well by sharing with me in my affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>Now you also know, Philippians, that at the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>because even in Thessalonica ˻on more than one occasion˼ you sent for my need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not that I seek the gift, but I seek for the profit that increases to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>But I have received everything in full and have an abundance; ˻I am well supplied˼because I received from Epaphroditus ˻what you had sent˼, a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>And my God will fulfill your every need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>Now to our God and Father be the glory ˻forever and ever˼. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers with me greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the saints greet you, and especially those of Caesar’s household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>We give thanks always to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ when we pray for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>since we heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and the love that you have for all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>because of the hope reserved for you in heaven, which you have heard about beforehand in the word of truth, the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>that has come to you, just as also in all the world it is bearing fruit and increasing, just as also among you from the day you heard about and understood the grace of God in truth,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>Because of this also we, from the day we heard about it, did not cease praying for you, and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual insight,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>because all things in the heavens and on the earth were created by him, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers, all things were created through him and for him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>I say this in order that no one will deceive you with persuasive speech,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>firmly rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding with thankfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>Beware lest ˻anyone take you captive˼ through philosophy and empty deceit, according to ˻human tradition˼, according to the elemental spirits of the world and not according to Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>because in him all the fullness of deity dwells bodily,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>And ˻although you were dead˼ in the trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>having destroyed the certificate of indebtedness in ordinances against us, which was hostile to us, and removed it out of the way by nailing it to the cross.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free, but Christ is all, and in all.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>because we remember your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>because our gospel did not come to you with word only, but also with power and with the Holy Spirit and with much certainty, just as you know what sort of people we became among you for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, receiving the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>so that you became an example to all those who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>for from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but in every place your faith toward God has gone out, so that we have no need to say anything.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For you yourselves know, brothers, our reception with you, that it was not in vain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>but after we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi, just as you know, we had the courage in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation is not from error or from impurity or with deceit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, thus we speak, not as pleasing people but God, who examines our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>˻For never˼ did we come with a word of flattery, just as you know, nor with a pretext of greediness (God is witness),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>nor seeking glory from people, neither from you nor from others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>˻Although we could have insisted on our own importance˼ as apostles of Christ, yet we became infants in your midst, like a nursing mother cherishes her own children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>Longing for you in this way, we determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls, because you had become dear to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For you remember, brothers, our labor and hardship: working by night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>You are witnesses, and so is God, how devoutly and righteously and blamelessly we became to you who believe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>just as you know how we treated each one of you, like a father his own children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>exhorting and consoling you and insisting that you live in a manner worthy of God, who calls you to his own kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>And because of this we also give thanks to God constantly, that when you received God’s word ˻that you heard˼ from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it truly is, the word of God, which also is at work in you who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For you became imitators, brothers, of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because you also suffered the same things at the hands of your own people, just as they themselves did also at the hands of the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and who persecuted us, and who are not pleasing to God and are opposed to all people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles in order that they may be saved, so that they always fill up their sins. But wrath has come upon them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But when we were made orphans by separation from you, brothers, for ˻a short time˼ (in face, not in heart), we were even more eager with great desire to see your face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>because we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, ˻on more than one occasion˼—and Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For who is our hope or joy or crown of boasting? Is it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming?</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we determined to be left behind in Athens alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>and we sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ, in order to strengthen and to encourage you about your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>so that no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are appointed for this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>for indeed when we were with you we told you beforehand that we were about to be afflicted, just as indeed it happened, and you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>Because of this, I also, when I could endure it no longer, sent in order to know your faith, lest somehow the tempter tempted you and our labor should be in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But now, because Timothy has come to us from you and has brought good news to us of your faith and love, and that ˻you always think kindly of us˼, desiring to see us just as also we desire to see you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>because of this, brothers, we have been comforted because of you in all our distress and affliction through your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>because now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanks can we repay to God concerning you, because of all the joy with which we rejoice because of you before our God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>night and day praying beyond all measure that we may see your face and complete what is lacking in your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>and may the Lord cause you to increase and to abound in love for one another and for all, just as also we do for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>so that your hearts may be established blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>Finally therefore, brothers, we ask you and appeal to you in the Lord Jesus that, just as you have received from us how it is necessary for you to live and to please God, just as indeed you are living, that you progress even more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For you know what commands we gave to you through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>not in lustful passion, just as also the Gentiles who do not know God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>not to transgress and to exploit his brother in the matter, because the Lord is the one who avenges concerning all these things, just as also we told you beforehand and testified solemnly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God did not call us to impurity, but in holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore the one who rejects thisis not rejecting man, but God, who also gives his Holy Spirit to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But concerning brotherly love, I do not have need to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>for indeed you are practicing it toward all the brothers in all of Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to progress even more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>and to aspire to live a quiet life, and to attend to ˻your own business˼, and to work with your own hands, just as we commanded you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>so that you may live decently toward those outside, and may have need of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>Now we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you will not grieve as also the rest, who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, thus also God will bring those who have fallen asleep through Jesus together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain until the Lord’s coming, will not possibly precede those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>Then we who are alive, who remain, will be snatched away at the same time together with them in the clouds for a meeting with the Lord in the air, and thus we will be together with the Lord always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Therefore comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need of anything to be written to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>for you yourselves well know that the day of the Lord is coming in the same way as a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>Whenever they say “Peace and security,” then sudden destruction will overtake them like the birth pains of ˻a pregnant woman˼, and they will not possibly escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But you, brothers, are not in the darkness, so that the day should catch you like a thief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>So then, we must not sleep like the rest, but must be on the alert and be self-controlled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But because we are of the day, we must be sober, by putting on the breastplate of faith and love and as a helmet the hope of salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>because God did not appoint us for wrath, but for the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live at the same time with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Therefore encourage one another and build up ˻each other˼, just as indeed you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and rule over you in the Lord and admonish you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>and to esteem them beyond all measure in love, because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>And we urge you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, console the discouraged, help the sick, be patient toward all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>See to it that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue good, both toward one another and toward all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice always,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>pray constantly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>give thanks in everything; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Do not quench the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Do not despise prophecies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>but examine all things; hold fast to what is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>Abstain from every form of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your spirit and soul and body be kept complete, blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>The one who calls you is faithful, who also will do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brothers, pray for us also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I adjure you by the Lord, have this letter read aloud to all the brothers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>Although God spoke long ago in many parts and in many ways to the fathers by the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>who is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence, sustaining all things by the word of his power. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>having become by so much better than the angels, by as much as he has inherited a more excellent name than theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the angels did he ever say,“You are my son,today I have fathered you,”and again,“I will be ˻his father˼,and he will be ˻my son˼”?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,“And let all the angels of God worship him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>And concerning the angels he says,“The one who makes his angels winds,and his servants a flame of fire,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>but concerning the Son,“Your throne, O God, is˻forever and ever˼,and the scepter of righteous is the scepter of your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;because of this God, your God, has anointed youwith the olive oil of joy more than your companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And,“You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning,and the heavens are the works of your hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>they will perish, but you continue,and they will all become old like a garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>and like a robe you will roll them up,and like a garment they will be changed;but you are the same, and your years will not run out.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>But to which of the angels has he ever said,“Sit down at my right hand,until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are they not all spirits engaged in special service, sent on assignment for the sake of those who are going to inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>Because of this, it is all the more necessary that we pay attention to the things we have heard, lest we drift away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the word spoken through angels was binding and every transgression and act of disobedience received a just penalty,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation which had its beginning when it was spoken through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>while God was testifying at the same time by signs and wonders and various miracles and distributions of the Holy Spirit according to his will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For he did not subject to angels the world to come, about which we are speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>But someone testified somewhere, saying,“What is man, that you remember him,or the son of man, that you care for him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>You made him for a short time lower than the angels;you crowned him with glory and honor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>you subjected all things under his feet.For in subjecting all things to him, he left nothing that was not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>but we see Jesus, for a short time made lower than the angels, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God he might taste death on behalf of everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it was fitting for him for whom are all things and through whom are all things in bringing many sons to glory to perfect the originator of their salvation through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For both the one who sanctifies and the ones who are sanctified are all from one, for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>saying,“I will proclaim your name to my brothers;in the midst of the assembly I will sing in praise of you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again,“I will trust in him.”And again,“Behold, I and the children God has given me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Therefore, since the children share in blood and flesh, he also in like manner shared in these same things, in order that through death he could destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and could set free these who through fear of death were subject to slavery throughout all their lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For surely he is not concerned with angels, but he is concerned with the descendants of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Therefore he was obligated to be made like his brothers in all respects, in order that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in the things relating to God, in order to make atonement for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>For in that which he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Therefore, holy brothers, sharers in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>who was faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses also was in all his household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>For this one is considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, inasmuch as the one who builds it has greater honor than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For every house is built by someone, but the one who built all thingsis God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>And Moses was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony to the things that would be spoken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>but Christ was faithful as a son over his house, whose house we are, if indeed we hold fast to our confidence and the hope we can be proud of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says,“Today, if you hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,in the day of testing in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>where your fathers tested me by trialand saw my works</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>for forty years.Therefore I was angry with this generation,and I said, ‘They always go astray in their heart,and they do not know my ways.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>As I swore in my anger,‘˻They will never enter˼ into my rest.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Watch out, brothers, lest there be in some of you an evil, unbelieving heart, with the result that you fall away from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>But encourage one another ˻day by day˼, as long as it is called “today,” so that ˻none of you become hardened˼ by the deception of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we have become partners of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of our commitment steadfast until the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>˻while it is said˼,“Today, if you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>For who, when they heard it, were disobedient? Surely it was not all who went out from Egypt through Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And to whom did he swear they would not enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>And so we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Therefore let us fear, while there remains a promise of entering into his rest, that none of you appear to fall short of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>˻For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us˼, just as those also did, but the message ˻they heard˼ did not benefit them, because they were not united with those who heard it in faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>For we who have believed enter into that rest, just as he has said,“As I swore in my anger,‘˻They will never enter˼ into my rest.’ ”And yet these works have been accomplished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>and in this passage again, ‘˻They will never enter˼ into my rest.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Since therefore it remains for some to enter into it, and the ones to whom the good news was proclaimed previously did not enter because of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>again he ordains a certain day, today, speaking by David after so long a time, just as had been said before,“Today, if you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Joshua had caused them to rest, he would not have spoken about another day after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>Consequently a sabbath rest remains for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For the one who has entered into his rest has also himself rested from his works, just as God did from his own works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Therefore, let us make every effort to enter into that rest, in order that no one may fall in the same pattern of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, both joints and marrow, and able to judge the reflections and thoughts of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>And no creature is hidden in the sight of him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of him to whom ˻we must give our account˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Therefore, because we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our weaknesses, but who has been tempted in all things in the same way, without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Therefore let us approach with confidence to the throne of grace, in order that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of people in the things relating to God, in order that he can offer both gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>being able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and led astray, since he himself also is surrounded by weakness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins ˻for himself also, as well as for the people˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And someone does not take for himself the honor, but is called by God, just as Aaron also was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>Thus also Christ did not glorify himself to become high priest, but the one who said to him,“You are my Son, today I have fathered you,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>just as also in another place he says,“You are a priest ˻forever˼ according to the order of Melchizedek,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>who in the days of his flesh offered up both prayers and supplications, with loud crying and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard as a result of his reverence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>and being perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation to all those who obey him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>being designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>Concerning this ˻we have much to say and it is difficult to explain˼, since you have become sluggish in hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For indeed, although you ought to be teachers ˻by this time˼, you have need of someone to teach you again the beginning elements of the oracles of God, and ˻you have need of˼ milk and not solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>For everyone who partakes of milk is unacquainted with the message of righteousness, because he is an infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have trained their faculties for the distinguishing of both good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Therefore, leaving behind the elementary message about Christ, let us move on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>teaching about baptisms and laying on of hands, and resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And this we will do, if God permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossible concerning those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and become sharers of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and having fallen away, to renew them again to repentence, because they have crucified again for themselves the Son of God and held him up to contempt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For ground that drinks the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth vegetation usable to those people˻for whose sake˼it is also cultivated, shares a blessing from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to a curse, whose end is for burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But even if we are speaking in this way, dear friends, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and belonging to salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not unjust, so as to forget your work and the love which you demonstrated for his name by having served the saints, and continuing to serve them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>And we desire each one of you to demonstrate the same diligence for the full assurance of your hope until the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>in order that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater to swear by, he swore by himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>saying,“Surely ˻I will greatly bless˼ you, and ˻I will greatly multiply˼ you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so, by persevering, he obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For people swear by what is greater than themselves, and the oath for confirmation is the end of all dispute for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>In the same way God, because he wanted to show even more to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his resolve, guaranteed it with an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>in order that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge may have powerful encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>which we have like an anchor of the soul, both firm and steadfast, and entering into the inside of the curtain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where Jesus, the forerunner for us, entered, because he became a high priest ˻forever˼ according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of everything—in the first place, his name is translated “king of righteousness,” and then also “king of Salem,” that is, “king of peace”;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God—he remains a priest for all time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>But see how great this man was, to whom even Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth from the spoils!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And indeed those of the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have a commandment to collect a tenth from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, although ˻they are descended from Abraham˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But the one who did not trace his descent from them collected tithes from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>Now without any dispute the inferior is blessed by the more prominent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>And in this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case it is testified that he lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>And, ˻so to speak˼, even Levi, the one who receives tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>Thus if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood, for on the basis of it the people received the law, what further need is there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek and not said to be according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For when the priesthood changes, of necessity there is a change of the law also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For the one about whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe from which no one has officiated at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is evident that our Lord is a descendant of Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses said nothing concerning priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And it is still more clear, if another priest according to the likeness of Melchizedek arises,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who has become a priest not according to a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For it is testified,“You are a priest ˻forever˼ according to the order of Melchizedek.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>For on the one hand a preceding commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>(for the law made nothing perfect), but on the other hand there is the introduction of a better hope through which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And by as much as this was not without an oath (for these on the one hand ˻have become priests˼ without an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>but he with an oath by the one who said to him,“The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind,‘You are a priest ˻forever˼’ ”),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>by so much more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>And indeed many ˻have become˼ priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>but he, because he continues ˻forever˼, holds the priesthood permanently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Therefore also he is able to save completely those who draw near to God through him, because he always lives in order to intercede on their behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For a high priest such as this indeed is fitting for us, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and having become exalted above the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>who does not ˻need every day˼ like the former high priests to offer up sacrifices for his own sins and then for the sins of the people, because he did this once for all when he offered up himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the statement of the oath, after the law, appoints a Son, who is made perfect ˻forever˼.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Now this is the main point in what has been said: we have a high priest such as this, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord set up, not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is appointed in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices; therefore it was necessary for this one also to have something that he offers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>Now if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, because there are those who offer the gifts according to the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>who serve a sketch and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned when he was about to complete the tabernacle, for he says, “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But now he has attained a more excellent ministry, by as much as he is also mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted upon better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if that first covenant had been faultless, occasion would not have been sought for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For in finding fault with them he says,“Behold, days are coming, says the Lord,when I will complete a new covenant with the house of Israeland with the house of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>not like the covenant which I made with their fatherson the day I took hold of them by my handto lead them out of the land of Egypt,because they did not continue in my covenantand I disregarded them, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>For this is the covenant that I will decree with the house of Israelafter those days, says the Lord:I am putting my laws in their mindsand I will write them on their hearts,and I will be ˻their˼ Godand they will be ˻my˼ people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And they will not teach each one his fellow citizenand each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’because they will all know me,from the least of them to the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>For I will be merciful toward their wrongdoings,and I will not remember their sins any longer.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>In calling it new, he has declared the former to be old. Now what is becoming obsolete and growing old is near to disappearing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and the earthly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For a tent was prepared, the first one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the presentation of the loaves, which is called the holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>And after the second curtain was a tent called the holy of holies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>containing the golden incense altar and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which were a golden jar containing the manna and the rod of Aaron that budded and the tablets of the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>And above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, about which it is not now possible to speak in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Now these things having been prepared in this way, the priests enter into the first tent ˻continually˼as they accomplish their service,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>but only the high priest enters into the second tent once a year, not without blood, which he offers on behalf of himself and the sins of the people committed in ignorance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>The Holy Spirit was making this clear, that the way into the holy place was not yet revealed, while the first tent was still in existence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>which was a symbol for the present time, in which both the gifts and sacrifices which were offered were not able to perfect the worshiper with respect to the conscience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>concerning instead only food and drink and different washings, regulations of outward things imposed until the time of setting things right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But Christ has arrived as a high priest of the good things to come. Through the greater and more perfect tent not made by hands, that is, not of this creation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>and not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered once for all into the most holy place, obtaining eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled sanctify them for the ritual purity of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works to serve the living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And because of this, he is the mediator of a new covenant, in order that, because a death has taken place for the redemption of transgressions committed during the first covenant, those who are the called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where there is a will, it is a necessity for the death of the one who made the will to be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For a will is in force concerning those who are dead, since it is never in force when the one who made the will is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Therefore not even the first covenant was ratified without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying,“This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>And likewise he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the utensils of service with the blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>Indeed, nearly everything is purified with blood according to the law, and apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>Therefore it was necessary for the sketches of the things in heaven to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves to be purified with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>and not in order that he can offer himself many times, as the high priest enters into the sanctuary ˻year by year˼ with blood not his own,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>since it would have been necessary for him to suffer many times from the foundation of the world, but now he has appeared once at the end of the ages for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And ˻just as˼ it is destined for people to die once, and after this, judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>thus also Christ, having been offered once in order to bear the sins of many, will appear for the second time without reference to sin to those who eagerly await him for salvation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For the law, possessing a shadow of the good things that are about to come, not the form of things itself, is never able ˻year by year˼ by means of the same sacrifices which they offer without interruption to make perfect those who draw near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>For otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the ones who worship, having been purified once and for all, would no longer have any consciousness of sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But in them there is a reminder of sins ˻year by year˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>Therefore, when he came into the world, he said,“Sacrifice and offering you did not want,but a body you prepared for me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>you did not delight in whole burnt offerings and offerings for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come—in the roll of the book it is written about me—to do your will, O God.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>When he says above,“Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and offerings for sinyou did not want, nor did you delight in,”which are offered according to the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>then he has said,“Behold, I have come to do your will.”He takes away the first in order to establish the second,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>by which will we are made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And every priest stands every day serving and offering the same sacrifices many times, which are never able to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But this one, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>from now on waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are made holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>“This is the covenant that I will decree for themafter those days, says the Lord:I am putting my laws on their hearts,and I will write them on their minds.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>He also says,“Their sins and their lawless deeds I will never remember again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence for the entrance into the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>by the new and living way which he inaugurated for us through the curtain, that is, his flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and since we have a great priest over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>let us approach with a true heart in the full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for the one who promised is faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>And let us think about ˻how to stir one another up to love˼ and good works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not abandoning ˻our meeting together˼, as is the habit of some, but encouraging each other, and by so much more as you see the day drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we keep on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that is about to consume the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>Anyone who rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>How much worse punishment do you think the person will be considered worthy of who treats with disdain the Son of God and who considers ordinary the blood of the covenant by which he was made holy and who insults the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>For we know the one who said,“Vengeance is mine, I will repay,”and again,“The Lord will judge his people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>But remember the former days in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>sometimes being publicly exposed both to insults and to afflictions, and sometimes becoming sharers with those who were treated in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For you both sympathized with the prisoners and put up with the seizure of your belongings with joy because you knew that you yourselves had a better and permanent possession.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Now faith is the realization of what is hoped for, the proof of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>For by this the people of old were approved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>By faith we understand the worlds were created by the word of God, in order that what is seen did not come into existence from what is visible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>By faith Abel offered to God a greater sacrifice than Cain, by which he was approved that he was righteous, because God approved him for his gifts, and through it he still speaks, although he is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>By faith Enoch was taken up, so that he did not experience death, and he was not found, because God took him up. For before his removal, he had been approved ˻as having been pleasing˼ to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>Now without faith it is impossible to please him, for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and is a rewarder of those who seek him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>By faith Noah, having been warned about things not yet seen, out of reverence constructed an ark for the deliverance of his family, by which he pronounced sentence on the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to a place that he was going to receive for an inheritance, and he went out, not knowing where he was going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'>By faith he lived in the land of promise as a stranger, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the fellow heirs of the same promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'>For he was expecting the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'>By faith, even though Sarah herself was barren, he received ˻the ability to procreate˼ even ˻past the normal age˼, because he regarded the one who had promised to be faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'>And therefore these were fathered from one man, and he being as good as dead, as the stars of heaven in number and like the innumerable sand by the shore of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.13'>These all died in faith without receiving the promises, but seeing them from a distance and welcoming them, and admitting that they were strangers and temporary residents on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'>For those who say such things make clear that they are seeking a homeland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.15'>And if they had been remembering that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.16'>But now they aspire to a better land, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.17'>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered Isaac, and the one who received the promises was ready to offer his one and only son,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.19'>having reasoned that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which he received him back also as a symbol.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.20'>By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things that were going to happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.21'>By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.22'>By faith Joseph, as he was dying, mentioned about the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave instructions about his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.23'>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw the child was handsome, and they were not afraid of the edict of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.24'>By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.25'>choosing instead to be mistreated with the people of God rather than to experience the transitory enjoyment of sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.26'>considering ˻reproach endured for the sake of Christ˼ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.27'>By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king, for he persevered as if he saw the invisible one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.28'>By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, in order that the one who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.29'>By faith they crossed the Red Sea as if on dry land; the Egyptians, ˻when they made the attempt˼, were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.30'>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been marched around for seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.31'>By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she welcomed the spies in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.32'>And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, and Samuel and the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.33'>who through faith conquered kingdoms, accomplished justice, obtained what was promised, shut the mouths of lions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.34'>extinguished the effectiveness of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong from weakness, became mighty in battle, put to flight enemy battle lines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.35'>Women received back their dead by resurrection. But others were tortured, not accepting release, in order that they might gain a better resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.36'>And others ˻experienced mocking and flogging˼, and in addition bonds and imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.37'>They were stoned, they were sawed in two, they died by murder with a sword, they wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, impoverished, afflicted, mistreated,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.38'>of whom the world was not worthy, wandering about on deserts and mountains and in caves and in holes in the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.39'>And all these, although they were approved through their faith, did not receive what was promised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.40'>because God had provided something better for us, so that they would not be made perfect without us.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.12'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.1'>Therefore, since we also have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us, putting aside every weight and ˻the sin that so easily ensnares us˼, let us run with patient endurance the race that has been set before us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.2'>fixing our eyes on Jesus, the originator and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.3'>For consider the one who endured such hostility against himself by sinners, so that you will not grow weary in your souls and give up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.4'>You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood as you struggle against sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.5'>And have you completely forgotten the exhortation which instructs you as sons?“My son, do not make light of the Lord’s discipline,or give up when you are corrected by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.6'>For the Lord disciplines the one whom he loves,and punishes every son whom he accepts.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.7'>Endure it for discipline. God is dealing with you as sons. For what son is there whom a father does not discipline?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.8'>But if you are without discipline, in which all legitimate sons have become participants, then you are illegitimate and not sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.9'>Furthermore, we have had ˻our earthly fathers˼ who disciplined us, and we respected them. Will we not much rather subject ourselves to the Father of spirits and live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.10'>For they disciplined us for a few days according to what seemed appropriate to them, but he does so for our benefit, in order that we can have a share in his holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.11'>Now all discipline seems for the moment not to be joyful but painful, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness for those who are trained by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.12'>Therefore strengthen your slackened hands and your weakened knees,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.13'>and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame will not be dislocated, but rather be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.14'>Pursue peace with everyone, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.15'>Take care that no one falls short of the grace of God; that no one growing up like a root of bitterness causes trouble, and by it many become defiled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.16'>that no one be a sexually immoral or totally worldly person like Esau, who for one meal traded his own birthright.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.17'>For you know that also afterwards, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, because he did not find an occasion for repentence, although he sought it with tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.18'>For you have not come to something that can be touched, and to a burning fire, and to darkness, and to gloom, and to a whirlwind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.19'>and to the noise of a trumpet, and to the sound of words which those who heard begged that not another word be spoken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.20'>For they could not endure what was commanded: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.21'>And the spectacle was so terrifying that Moses said, “I am terrified and trembling.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.22'>But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to tens of thousands of angels, to the festal gathering</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.23'>and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous people made perfect,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.24'>and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and ˻to the sprinkled blood˼ that speaks better than Abel’s does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.25'>Watch out that you do not refuse the one who is speaking! For if those did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth, much less will we escape, if we reject the one who warns from heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.26'>whose voice shook the earth at that time, but now he has promised, saying,“Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.27'>Now the phrase “yet once more” indicates the removal of what is shaken, namely, things that have been created, in order that the things that are not shaken may remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.28'>Therefore, since we are receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us be thankful, through which let us serve God acceptably, with awe and reverence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.29'>For indeed our God is a consuming fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.1'>Brotherly love must continue.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.3'>Remember the prisoners, as though you were fellow-prisoners; remember the mistreated, as thoughyou yourselves also are being mistreated in the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.4'>Marriage must be held in honor by all, and the marriage bed be undefiled, because God will judge sexually immoral people and adulterers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.5'>Your lifestyle must be free from the love of money, being content with what you have. For he himself has said, “I will never desert you, and I will never abandon you.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'>Listen, my dear brothers! Did not God choose the poor of the world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jas.3.14'>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and tell lies against the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.15'>This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.16'>For where there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there is disorder and every evil practice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.17'>But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, obedient, full of mercy and good fruits, nonjudgmental, without hypocrisy,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace meant for you sought and made careful inquiry,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if you endure when you do good and suffer for it, this finds favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you should follow in his footsteps,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>who did not commit sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>who when he was reviled, did not revile in return; when suffering, he did not threaten, but entrusted himself to the one who judges justly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we may die to sins and live to righteousness, by whose wounds you were healed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>In the same way, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some are disobedient to the word, they may be won over without a word by the conduct of their wives,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>And finally, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, showing mutual affection, compassionate, humble,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>not repaying evil for evil or insult for insult, but on the other hand blessing others, because for this reason you were called, so that you could inherit a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>For“The one who wants to love lifeand see good daysmust keep his tongue from eviland his lips must not speak deceit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>But even if you might suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. And do not be afraid of their intimidation or be disturbed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>but set Christ apart as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense to anyone who asks you for an accounting concerning the hope that is in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>But do so with courtesy and respect, having a good conscience, so that in the things in which you are slandered, the ones who malign your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>For it is better to suffer for doing good, ˻if God wills it˼, than for doing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>For Christ also suffered once for sins,the just for the unjust,in order that he could bring you to God,being put to death in the flesh,but made alive in the spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>in which also he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>who were formerly disobedient, when the patience of God waited in the days of Noah, while an ark was being constructed, in which a few—that is, eight souls—were rescued through water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>And also, corresponding to this, baptism now saves you, not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, with angels and authorities and powers having been subjected to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Therefore, because Christ suffered in the flesh, you also equip yourselves with the same way of thinking, because the one who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>in order to live the remaining time in the flesh no longer for human desires, but for the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>For the time that has passed was sufficient ˻to do what the Gentiles desire to do˼, having lived in licentiousness, evil desires, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties, and wanton idolatries,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>They will give an account to the one who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>Because for this reason also the gospel was preached to those who are dead, so that they were judged ˻by human standards˼ in the flesh, but they may live in the spirit ˻by God’s standards˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>Now the end of all things draws near. Therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for your prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>Above all, keep your love for one another constant, because love covers a large number of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>Be hospitable to one another without complaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>Just as each one has received a gift, use it for serving one another, as good stewards of the varied grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>If anyone speaks, let it be as the oracles of God; if anyone serves, let it be as by the strength that God provides, so that in all things God will be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the power ˻forever and ever˼. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, when it takes place to test you, as ifsomething strange were happening to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>But to the degree that you share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that also at the revelation of his glory you may rejoice and be glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>If you are reviled on account of the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>By all means do not let anyone of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>But if someone suffers as a Christian, he must not be ashamed, but must glorify God with this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>For it is the time for the judgment to begin out from the household of God. But if it begins out from us first, what will be the outcome for those who are disobedient to the gospel of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>And if the righteous are saved with difficulty, ˻what will become of the ungodly and the sinner˼?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>So then also those who suffer according to the will of God must entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing good.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.1'>Therefore I, your fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a sharer of the glory that is going to be revealed, exhort the elders among you:</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.2'>May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.3'>because his divine power has bestowed on us all thingsthat are necessary for life and godliness, through the knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and excellence of character,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.4'>through which things he has bestowed on us his precious and very great promises, so that through these you may become sharers of the divine nature after escaping from the corruption that is in the world because of evil desire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.5'>and for this same reason, and by applying all diligence, supply with your faith excellence of character, and with excellence of character, knowledge,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.7'>and with godliness, brotherly love, and with brotherly love, love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.8'>For if these things are yours and are increasing, this does not make you useless or unproductive in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.9'>For the one for whom these thingsare not present is blind, being nearsighted, ˻having forgotten the cleansing˼ of his former sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.10'>Therefore, brothers, be zealous even more to make your calling and election secure, because if you do these things, you will never ever stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.11'>For in this way entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly supplied for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.12'>Therefore I intend to remind you continually concerning these things, although you know them and are established in the truth that you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.13'>But I consider it right, for as long as I am in this habitation, to stir you up by a reminder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.14'>because I know that the removal of my habitation is imminent, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.15'>And I will also make every effort that you are able at any time, after my departure, ˻to recall these things to mind˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.16'>For we did not make known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ by following ingeniously concocted myths, but by being eyewitnesses of that one’s majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.17'>For he received honor and glory from God the Father when a voice such as this was brought to him by the Majestic Glory, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.1'>But there were also false prophets among the people, as there will be false teachers among you also, who will bring in ˻destructive heresies˼, even denying the Master who bought them, thus bringing on themselves swift destruction.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.3'>And in greediness they will exploit you with false words, whose condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.4'>For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but held them captive in Tartarus with chains of darkness and handed them over to be kept for judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'>and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a proclaimer of righteousness, ˻and seven others˼when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'>(for that righteous man, as he lived among them day after day, was tormenting his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he was seeing and hearing),</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to reserve the unrighteous to be punished at the day of judgment,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'>whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, do not bring against them a demeaning judgment from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'>But these persons, like irrational animals born only with natural instincts for capture and killing, blaspheming ˻about things˼ they do not understand, in their destruction will also be destroyed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'>being harmed as the wages of unrighteousness. Considering reveling in the daytime a pleasure, they are stains and blemishes, carousing in their deceitful pleasures when they feast together with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'>having eyes full of desire for an adulteress and unceasing from sin, enticing unstable persons, and having hearts trained for greediness. Accursed children!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'>By leaving the straight path, they have gone astray, because they followed the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'>but received a rebuke for his own lawlessness: a speechless donkey, speaking with a human voice, restrained ˻the prophet’s madness˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'>These people are waterless springs and mists driven by a hurricane, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'>˻For by speaking high-sounding but empty words˼, they entice with desires of the flesh and with licentiousness those who are scarcely escaping from those who live in error,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'>promising them freedom although they themselves are slaves of depravity. For to whatever someone succumbs, by this he is enslaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'>For if, after they have escaped from the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and they are again entangled in these thingsand succumb to them, the last state has become worse for them than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'>For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment that had been delivered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'>The statement of the true proverb has happened to them, “A dog returns to its own vomit,” and “A sow, after washing herself, returns to wallowing in the mud.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'>Dear friends, this is already the second letter I am writing to you, in both of which I am attempting to stir up your sincere mind by a reminder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'>to remember the words proclaimed beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'>above all knowing this, that in the last days scoffers will come with scoffing, following according to their own desires</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'>and saying, “Where is the promise of his coming? For ˻ever since˼ the fathers fell asleep, all things have continued just as they have been from the beginning of creation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'>For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that the heavens existed long ago and the earth held together out of water and through water by the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>by means of which things the world that existed at that time was destroyed by being inundated with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>But by the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>Now, dear friends, do not let this one thing escape your notice, that one day with the Lord is like a thousand years, and a thousand years is like one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>The Lord is not delaying the promise, as some consider slowness, but is being patient toward you, because he does not want any to perish, but all to come to repentence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will disappear with a rushing noise, and the celestial bodies will be destroyed by being burned up, and the earth and the deeds done on it will be disclosed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>Because all these things are being destroyed in this way, what sort of people must you be in holy behavior and godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'>while waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by being burned up and the celestial bodies will melt as they are consumed by heat!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>But according to his promise, we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness resides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>Therefore, dear friends, because you are waiting for these things, make every effort to be found at peace, spotless and unblemished in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as also our dear brother Paul wrote to you, according to the wisdom that was given to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>as he does also in all his letters, speaking in them about these things, in which there are some things hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable distort to their own destruction, as they also do the rest of the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>Therefore, dear friends, because you know this beforehand, guard yourselves so that you do not lose your own safe position because you have been led away by the error of lawless persons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>My little children, I am writing these things to you in order that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous one,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this reason the Son of God was revealed: in order to destroy the works of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>Everyone who is fathered by God does not practice sin, because his seed resides in him, and he is not able to sin, because he has been fathered by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>By this the children of God and the children of the devil are evident: everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, namely, the one who does not love his brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.19.2'>because his judgments are true and righteous,because he has passed judgment on the great prostitutewho corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality,and has avenged the blood of his slaves ˻shed by˼ her hand!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.3'>And a second time they said,“Hallelujah!”And her smoke goes up ˻forever and ever˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.4'>And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who is seated on the throne, saying,“Amen! Hallelujah!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.5'>And a voice came out from the throne, saying,“Praise our Godall his slaves,and those who fear him,the small and the great!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.6'>And I heard something like the sound of a great crowd and something like the sound of many waters and something like the sound of powerful thunder, saying,“Hallelujah!For the Lord our God the All-Powerful reigns!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.7'>Let us rejoice and be gladand give him the glory,because the wedding celebration of the Lamb has come,and his bride has prepared herself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.8'>And it has been granted to her that she be dressed in bright, clean fine linen (for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.9'>And he said to me, “Write: Blessed are those who are invited to the banquet of the wedding celebration of the Lamb!” And he said to me, “These are the true words of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.10'>And I fell down before his feet to worship him, and he said to me, “˻Do not do that!˼ I am a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.11'>And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and the one seated on it was called “Faithful” and “True,” and with justice he judges and makes war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.12'>Now his eyes were like a flame of fire, and on his head were many royal headbands having a name written that no one except he himself knows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.13'>And he was dressed in an outer garment dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.14'>And the armies that are in heaven, dressed in clean, white fine linen, were following him on white horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.15'>And out of his mouth came a sharp sword, so that with it he could strike the nations. And he will shepherd them with an iron rod, and he stomps the winepress of the wine of the furious wrath of God, the All-Powerful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.16'>And he has a name written on his outer garment and on his thigh: “King of kings and Lord of lords.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.17'>And I saw one angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly ˻directly overhead˼,“Come! Assemble for the great banquet of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.18'>in order that you may eat the flesh of kings,and the flesh of military tribunes,and the flesh of the powerful,and the flesh of horses and those seated on them,and the flesh of all people,both free and slave,and small and great!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.19'>And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war with the one who is seated on the horse and with his army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.20'>And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed the signs before him, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who had worshiped his image. The two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulphur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.21'>And the rest were killed by the sword of the one who is seated on the horse—the sword that comes out of his mouth—and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.20'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.1'>And I saw an angel descending from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.2'>And he seized the dragon—the ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan—and bound him for a thousand years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.3'>and threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it above him, in order that he could not deceive the nations again until the thousand years are completed. After these things it is necessary for him to be released for a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.4'>And I saw thrones, and they sat down on them, and authority to judge was granted to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and did not receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand, and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.5'>(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed.) This is the first resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.6'>Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection. Over this person the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for the thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.7'>And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.8'>and he will go out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to assemble them for battle, ˻whose number˼is like the sand of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.9'>And they went up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the fortified camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and consumed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.10'>And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulphur, where the beast and the false prophet also are, and they will be tormented day and night ˻forever and ever˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.11'>And I saw a great white throne and the one who was seated on it, ˻from whose presence˼ earth and heaven fled, and a place was not found for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.12'>And I saw the dead—the great and the small—standing before the throne, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.13'>And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and each one was judged according to their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.14'>And Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death—the lake of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.15'>And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.21'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.1'>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea did not exist any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.2'>And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.3'>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,“Behold, the dwelling of God is with humanity,and he will take up residence with them,and they will be his peopleand God himself will be with them as their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.4'>And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes,and death will not exist any longer,and mourning or wailing or pain will not exist any longer,because the former things have passed away.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.5'>And the one seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new!” And he said, “Write, because these words are faithful and true.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.6'>And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the one who is thirsty I will give water from the spring of the water of life freely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.7'>The one who conquers will inherit these things, and I will be ˻his God˼ and he will be ˻my son˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.8'>But as for the cowards and unbelievers and detestable persons and murderers and sexually immoral people and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their share is in the lake that burns with fire and sulphur, which is the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.9'>And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.10'>And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and lofty mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.11'>that has the glory of God. Its radiance is like a precious stone, something like a jasper stone, shining like crystal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.12'>It has a great and high wall that has twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written on the gates which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.13'>on the east, three gates, and on the north, three gates, and on the south, three gates, and on the west, three gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.14'>And the wall of the city has twelve foundations, and on them are twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.15'>And the one who spoke with me was holding a golden measuring rod in order that he could measure the city and its gates and its wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.16'>And the city is laid out as a square, and its length is the same as its width. And he measured the city with the measuring rod at twelve thousand stadia; the length and the width and the height of it are equal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.17'>And he measured its wall, one hundred forty-four cubits ˻according to human measure˼, which is the angel’s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.18'>And the material of its wall is jasper, and the city is pure gold, similar in appearance to pure glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.19'>The foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every kind of precious stone: the first foundation jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.20'>the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.21'>And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, each one of the gates was from a single pearl. And the street of the city is pure gold, like transparent glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.22'>And I did not see a temple in it, for the Lord God All-Powerful is its temple, and the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.23'>And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon, that they shine on it, for the glory of God illuminates it, and its lamp is the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.24'>And the nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.25'>And its gates will never be shut by day (for there will be no night there),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.26'>and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.27'>And every unclean person and the one who practices detestable things and falsehood will never enter into it, except those who are written in the book of life of the Lamb.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.22'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.1'>And he showed me the river of the water of life, clear as crystal, coming out from the throne of God and of the Lamb</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.2'>in the middle of its street, and ˻on both sides of the river˼is the tree of life, producing twelve fruits—yielding its fruit according to every month—and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.3'>And there will not be any curse any longer, and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his slaves will serve him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.4'>and they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.5'>And night will not exist any longer, and they will not have need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun, because the Lord God will give light to them. And they will reign ˻forever and ever˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.6'>And he said to me, “These words are faithful and true, and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his slaves the things which must take place in a short time.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.7'>“And behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.8'>And I, John, am the one who heard and who saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed these things to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.9'>And he said to me, “˻Do not do that!˼ I am your fellow slave, and of your brothers the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Worship God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.10'>And he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.11'>The one who does evil, let him do evil still, and the defiled, let him be defiled still, and the righteous, let him practice righteousness still, and the holy, let him be holy still.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.12'>“Behold, I am coming quickly, and my reward is with me, to repay each one according to what his deeds are!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.13'>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.14'>Blessed are the ones who wash their robes, so that their authority will be over the tree of life and they may enter into the city through the gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.15'>Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the sexually immoral people and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and who practices falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.16'>“I, Jesus, sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.17'>And the Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And the one who hears, let him say, “Come!” And the one who is thirsty, let him come. The one who wants, let him take the water of life freely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.18'>I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.19'>And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy, God will take away his share of the tree of life and from the holy city that are written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.20'>The one who testifies about these things says, “Yes, I am coming quickly!” Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.21'>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all.</verse>
