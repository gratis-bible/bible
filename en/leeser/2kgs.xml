      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.1'>Then did Moab rebel against Israel after the death of Achab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.2'>And Achazyah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and became sick; and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover from this sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.3'>But an angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.4'>Now therefore, thus hath said the Lord, From the bed on which thou art gone up shalt thou not come down; for thou shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.5'>And the messengers returned unto him, and he said unto them, Why is this that ye are already returned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.6'>And they said unto him, There came up a man to meet us, and he said unto us, Go, return unto the king that hath sent you, and speak unto him, Thus hath said the Lord, Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore from the bed on which thou art gone up shalt thou not come down; for thou shalt surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.7'>And he spoke unto them, What is the manner of the man who came up to meet you, and spoke unto you these words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.8'>And they said unto him, He is a hairy man, with a girdle of leather girded about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.9'>Then did he send unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty: and he went up to him, and, behold, he was sitting on the top of the mount; and he spoke unto him, O man of God, the king hath commanded, Come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.10'>And Elijah answered and spoke to the captain of the fifty, And if I be a man of God, let a fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down a fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.11'>And he sent again unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he commenced and spoke unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.12'>And Elijah answered and spoke unto them, If I be a man of God, let a fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.13'>And he sent again a captain of fifty the third time with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and bent down on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and spoke unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life and the life of these fifty thy servants be precious in thy eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.14'>Behold, there came down a fire from heaven, and consumed the two captains of the first fifties with their fifties; and now let my life be precious in thy eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.15'>And the angel of the Lord spoke unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him, and he arose, and went down with him unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.16'>And he spoke unto him, Thus hath said the Lord, Forasmuch as thou didst send messengers to inquire of Baalzebub the God of Ekron, as though there were no God in Israel to inquire of his word: therefore from the bed on which thou art gone up shalt thou not come down; for thou shalt surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.17'>And he died, according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken; and Jehoram became king in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah; because he had no son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.18'>Now the rest of the acts of Achazyahu which he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.1'>And it came to pass, when the Lord was about to take up Elijah by a stormwind to heaven, that Elijah went out with Elisha from Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.2'>And Elijah said unto Elisha, Remain, I pray thee, here; for the Lord hath sent me as far as Bethel. But Elisha said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.3'>And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that today the Lord will take away thy master from thy head? And he said, I also know it; be still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.4'>And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, remain, I pray thee, here; for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. But he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.5'>And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that today the Lord will take away thy master from thy head? And he said, I also know it; be still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.6'>And Elijah said unto him, Remain, I pray thee, here; for the Lord hath sent me to the Jordan. But he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So these two went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.7'>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite to them afar off: and those two stood by the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.8'>And Elijah took his mantle, and folded it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, and they went, both of them, over on dry ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.9'>And it came to pass, when they passed over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I shall be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, Let there be, I pray thee, a double portion of thy spirit upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.10'>And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so given unto thee; but if not, it shall not be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.11'>And it came to pass, as they went on, speaking as they were going, that, behold, there came a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a stormwind to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.12'>And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and their horsemen. And he saw him no more; and he took hold of his clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.13'>And he lifted up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back, and stood by the border of the Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.14'>And he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the Lord the God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither; and Elisha passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.15'>And when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho, at a distance, saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah Doth rest on Elisha. And they came forth to meet him, and bowed themselves unto him to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.16'>And they said unto him, Behold now, there are among thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master; peradventure the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him up, and cast him upon one of the mountains, or into one of the valleys. And he said, Ye must not send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.17'>And they urged him till he was ashamed, when he said, Send. And they sent fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.18'>And they returned again to him, for he had remained at Jericho; and he then said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Ye should not go?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.19'>And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is good, as my Lord seeth; but the water is bad, and the land causeth untimely births.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.20'>And he said, Fetch me a new flask, and put salt therein: and they fetched it to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.21'>And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast therein the salt, and said, Thus hath said the Lord, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or untimely births.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.22'>So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.23'>And he went up from there to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and they mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, baldhead! go up, baldhead!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.24'>And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord; and there came forth two shebears out of the forest, and tore of them forty and two boys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.25'>And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.1'>And Jehoram the son of Achab became king over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, and he reigned twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.2'>And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord; but not like his father, and like his mother; and he removed the statue of Baal which his father had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.3'>Nevertheless unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had induced Israel to sin, did he cleave: he departed not therefrom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.4'>And Mesha the king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered as tribute unto the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, with the wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.5'>And it came to pass, when Achab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.6'>And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and numbered all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.7'>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up, I as thyself, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.8'>And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he said, The way through the wilderness of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.9'>So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they took a circuitous route, a seven days journey; and there was no water for the camp, and for the cattle that followed in their train.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.10'>And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the Lord hath called these three kings, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.11'>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may inquire of the Lord from him? And there answered one of the king of Israels servants and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.12'>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the Lord is with him. And there went down to him the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.13'>And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Not so; for the Lord hath called these three kings, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.14'>And Elisha said, As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I have stood, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.15'>But now bring me a musician. And it came to pass, when the musician played, that the inspiration of the Lord came upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.16'>And he said, Thus hath said the Lord, Make this valley full of ditches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.17'>For thus hath said the Lord, Ye shall not perceive wind, nor shall ye see rain; yet this valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, yourselves, and your flocks, and your cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.18'>And this is yet too light a thing in the eyes of the Lord; and he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.19'>And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and every good tree shall ye fell, and all springs of water shall ye stop, and every good piece of land shall ye spoil with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.20'>And it came to pass in the morning, at the time when the meatoffering is offered, that, behold, there came water by the way from Edom, and the country was filled with the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.21'>And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they were called together from every one who was girded with a sword, and upward, and they posted themselves on the border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.22'>And when they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, the Moabites saw the water at a distance as red as blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.23'>And they said, This is blood; the kings have certainly had a contest among themselves, and they have smitten one another: and now, up to the spoil, Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.24'>But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they smote the Moabites completely, even in their own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.25'>And the cities they pulled down, and into every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it up, and every spring of water they stopped, and every good tree they felled, until they left only its stones in Kirchareseth, and this the slingers encompassed and smote it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.26'>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too strong for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew the sword, to break through unto the king of Edom; but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.27'>Then took he his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burntoffering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.1'>And a certain woman, of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou well knowest that thy servant was one who feared the Lord: and now the creditor is come to take my two sons unto himself for servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.2'>And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid hath nothing in the house, save a pot of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.3'>And he said, Go, borrow for thyself vessels from abroad from all thy neighbors, empty vessels, let them not be a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.4'>And then go home, and lock the door behind thee and behind thy sons, and then pour out into all those vessels; and that which is full thou shalt set aside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.5'>So she went from him, and locked the door behind her and behind her sons, who brought the vessels near to her, and she poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.6'>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring near to me yet another vessel; and he said unto her, There is not a vessel more: and the oil stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.7'>Then came she and told it to the man of God; and he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and thou with thy children shalt live of the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.8'>And it happened one day, that Elisha passed over to Shunem, and there was a great woman, and she constrained him to eat bread; and it happened, that as oft as he passed by, he used to turn in thither to eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.9'>And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who passeth through by us continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.10'>Let us then make a little upper chamber, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a chair, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.11'>And it happened one day, that he came thither, and he turned into the upper chamber, and lay there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.12'>And he said to Gechazi his servant, Call this Shunammite: and he called her, and she stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.13'>And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been at pains to take all this trouble for us: what is to be done for thee? wouldst thou be spoken for to the king, or to the chief of the army? And she said, I dwell in the midst of my own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.14'>And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gechazi said, Verily, she hath no son, and her husband is old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.15'>And he said, Call her: and he called her, and she stood in the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.16'>And he said, At this season, next year, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, No, my Lord, man of God, do not deceive thy handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.17'>But the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season in the following year, as Elisha had spoken unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.18'>And the child grew up; and it happened one day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.19'>And he said unto his father, My head, my head: and he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.20'>And he took him up, and brought him to his mother, and he sat on her knees till noon, when he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.21'>And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and locked the door behind him, and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.22'>And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the sheasses, that I may hasten as far as the man of God, and return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.23'>And he said, Wherefore art thou going to him today? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It is well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.24'>Then she saddled the sheass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; do not restrain me in riding, unless I say it to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.25'>So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel; and it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gechazi his servant, Behold, yonder that Shunammite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.26'>Now do run to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with thy child? and she answered, It is well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.27'>And she came to the man of God to the mount, and caught hold of his feet; and Gechazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is grieved within her; and the Lord hath hidden it from me, and hath not told it me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.28'>And she said, Did I request a son from my Lord? did I not say, Do not lead me astray?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.29'>Then said he to Gechazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, thou shalt not salute him; and if any salute thee, thou shalt not answer him; and lay my staff upon the face of the lad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.30'>And the mother of the lad said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose and followed her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.31'>And Gechazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the lad; but there was neither voice, nor perceptible sound; wherefore he went back to meet him, and told him, saying, The lad is not awakened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.32'>And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the lad was dead, laid upon his bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.33'>And he went in and locked the door behind both of them, and prayed unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.34'>And he went up, and laid himself upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and he stretched himself upon him: and the flesh of the child became warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.35'>Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself again upon him; and the lad sneezed as many as seven times, and the lad opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.36'>And he called Gechazi, and said, Call this Shunammite: so he called her, and she came in unto him; and he said, Take up thy son.</verse>
