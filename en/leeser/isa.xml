      <chapter osisID='Isa.1'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziyahu, Jotham, Achaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the Lord hath spoken: Children have I nourished and brought up, but they have rebelled against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his masters crib: Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>Woe! sinful nation, people laden with iniquity, seed of evildoers, children that are corrupt: they have forsaken the Lord, they have incensed the Holy One of Israel, they are departed backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>Why will ye be stricken yet more? that ye increase the revolt? every head is sick, and every heart is faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, nor bound up, nor mollified with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your country is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire; your soilin your presence, strangers devour it, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>And left is the daughter of Zion as a hut in a vineyard, as a lodge in a cucumber field, as a besieged city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>Unless the Lord of hosts had left unto us a remnant ever so small, like Sodom should we have been, unto Gomorrah should we have been compared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom: give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>For what serveth me the multitude of your sacrifices? saith the Lord: I am sated with the burntofferings of rams, and the fat of fatted beasts; and the blood of bullocks, and of sheep, and of hegoats, I do not desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>When ye come to appear in my presencewho hath required this at your hand, to tread down my courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>Continue no more to bring an oblation of deceit; incense of abomination is it unto me: new moon and sabbath, the calling of assembliesI cannot bear misdeed with festive gathering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are become a burden unto me; I am weary to bear them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will withdraw my eyes from you; yea, when ye make ever so many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your deeds from before my eyes; cease to do evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>Learn to do well; seek for justice, relieve the oppressed, do justice to the fatherless, plead for the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins should be as scarlet, they shall become white as the snow; though they should be red like crimson, they shall become like wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'>If ye be willing and obey, the best of the land shall ye eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'>But if ye refuse and rebel, by the sword shall ye be devoured; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'>How is she become a harlot, the faithful town! she, that was full of justice; righteousness lodged therein; but now murderers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine is drugged with water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>Thy princes are rebels, and companions of thieves; every one loveth brides, and runneth after rewards; to the fatherless they will not do justice, and the cause of the widow doth not come unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>Therefore saith the Lord, the Eternal of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will take satisfaction on my adversaries, and be avenged on my enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>And I will turn my hand against thee, and purge away as with lye thy dross, and remove all thy tin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning; after that shalt thou be called, The city of righteousness, the town that is faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Zion shall be redeemed through justice, and her converts through righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>But destruction shall come over transgressors and sinners together, and those that forsake the Lord shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>For people shall be ashamed because of the terebinths which ye had desired, and ye shall be put to the blush because of the gardens that ye had chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>For ye shall be as a terebinth the leaves of which wither, and as a garden that hath no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>And the mighty oppressor shall become as tow, and his workman as a spark; and they shall both burn together, with none to quench.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz foresaw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lords house shall be firmly established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and unto it shall flow all the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us of his ways, and we may walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>And he will judge among the nations, and decide for many people; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruningknives: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, and they shall not learn any more war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>For thou hast abandoned thy people, the house of Jacob, because they are full of witchcraft more than the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and with the children of strangers they unite themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'>And full became their land of silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures; and full became their land of horses, and there is no end to their chariots;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>And full became their land of idols; to the work of their own hands they bow themselves, to what their own fingers have made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>And so is bent down the son of earth, and humbled the man; and thou wilt not forgive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, because of the dread of the Lord, and because of the glory of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The looks of human pride shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bent down: and exalted shall be the Lord alone on that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>For there is a day of judgment unto the Lord of hosts over every proud and lofty one; and over every exalted one, that he be brought low;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>And over all the cedars of the Lebanon, the high and exalted, and over all the oaks of Bashan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>And over all the high mountains, and over all the exalted hills;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>And over every high tower, and over every fortified wall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>And over all the ships of Tharshish; and over all desirable palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'>And the pride of man shall be bent down, and the haughtiness of men shall be humbled: and exalted shall be the Lord alone on that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'>And the idols will he utterly abolish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'>And men shall enter into the caverns of rocks, and into the rifts of the earth, because of the dread of the Lord, and because of the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to terrify the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'>On that day shall a man cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which have been made for him to worship, to the moles and to the bats;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'>To enter into the clefts of the rocks, and into the hollows of the cliffs, because of the dread of the Lord, and because of the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to terrify the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'>Withdraw yourselves then from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; because, for what is he to be esteemed?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'>For, behold, the Lord, the Eternal of hosts, doth remove from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, every stay of bread, and every stay of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'>The hero, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'>The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counsellor, and the skilful artificer, and the eloquent orator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'>And I will set up boys as their princes, and children shall rule over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'>And so shall the people press man against man, and one against the other: the boy shall demean himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honorable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'>When a man will seize hold on his brother in the house of his father, saying, Thou hast a garment, thou shalt be our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'>He will swear on that day, saying, I will not be a chief; and in my house is neither bread nor clothing; you shall not appoint me a ruler of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'>For Jerusalem is sunk to decay, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against the Lord, to incense the eyes of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'>The boldness of their face testifieth against them; and like Sodom they tell openly their sin, they conceal it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have prepared evil unto themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'>Say ye to the righteous, that he hath done well; for the fruit of their doings shall they eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'>Woe unto the wicked who doeth evil; for the recompense of his hands shall be bestowed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>My people! their oppressors are children, and women rule over them. O my people! thy leaders cause thee to err, and the direction of thy paths they corrupt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'>The Lord is stepped forth to plead, and standeth up to judge the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'>The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and their princes; but yeye have eaten up the vineyard; the plunder of the poor is in your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'>What mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind down the faces of the poor? saith the Lord the Eternal of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'>And the Lord said, Forasmuch as the daughters of Zion are proud, and walk with stretched forth necks and casting about their eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'>Therefore will the Lord smite with leprosy the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will lay open their nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'>On that day will the Lord take away the beauty of their tinkling shoebuckles, and the hairnets, and the crescentshaped ornaments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'>The drops, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'>The bonnets, and the footchains, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'>The fingerrings, and nosejewels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.22'>The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the pockets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'>The mirrors, and the chemisettes, and the turbans, and the long vails.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'>And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be corruption; and instead of a girdle a rope; and instead of curled hair baldness; and instead of a wide garment a girding of sackcloth, a mark of burning instead of beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'>Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty ones in the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'>And then shall her gates lament and mourn; and stript of all shall she sit upon the ground.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'>And seven women shall take hold of one man on that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, take but away our reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'>On that day shall the sprout of the Lord be for ornament and for honor, and the fruit of the land for excellence and for glory for the escaped of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'>And it shall come to pass, that whoever is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, every one that is written down unto life in Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.4'>When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have scoured away the bloodguiltiness of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.5'>And then will the Lord create upon every dwelling of mount Zion, and upon her places of assembly, a cloud and smoke by day, and the brightness of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a covering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.6'>And a tabernacle shall it be for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge, and for a covert from tempest and from rain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'>I will sing now for my beloved, the song of my dear one touching his vineyard. A vineyard had my beloved on a rich hilltop;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'>And he fenced it in, and cleared it of stones, and planted it with the choicest vines, and built a tower in its midst, and also a winepress he hewed out therein: and he hoped that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth worthless fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'>What more was to be done to my vineyard, that I had not done in it? Why then did I hope that it should bring forth grapes, while it brought forth worthless fruit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'>And now I will let you know also what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten off; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trodden down;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'>And I will lay it quite waste; it shall not be pruned, nor hoed around; and it shall be overgrown with briers and thorns; and the clouds will I command that they send down no rain upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'>For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the plant of his delight: and he hoped for justice, but behold injustice; for equity, but behold iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'>Woe unto those that cause house to join on house, bring field near to field, till there is no more room, so that ye may be left alone as the inhabitants in the midst of the land!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'>In my ears spoke the Lord of hosts, Truly many houses shall become desolate, yea, great and beautiful ones without an inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'>Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath, and a chomerseed shall yield but an ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'>Woe unto those that rise up early in the morning, that they may run after strong drink; that continue until late in the twilight, till wine inflame them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'>And there are harp and psaltery, tambourine and flute, and wine at their drinkingfeasts; but the deeds of the Lord they regard not, and the works of his hands they behold not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'>Therefore are my people led into exile, for want of knowledge: and their honorable men suffer of famine, and their multitude are panting with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'>Therefore hath the deep enlarged her desire, and opened her mouth without measure: and there descend Jerusalems glory, and her multitude, and her noise, and whoever rejoiced therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'>And bent down shall be the son of earth, and humbled shall be the man, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'>And the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy God shall be sanctified by displaying his righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'>Then shall the sheep feed according to their wont, and the ruins of the fat ones shall sojourners eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'>Woe unto those that draw iniquity with the cords of falsehood, and as with a wagonrope, sinfulness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'>That say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it: and let draw nigh and come the counsel of the Holy One of Israel, that we may know it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.20'>Woe unto those that say of the evil it is good, and of the good it is evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.21'>Woe unto those that are wise in their own eyes, and intelligent in their own esteem!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.22'>Woe unto those that are heroes to drink wine, and men of might to mingle strong drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'>Who justify the wicked in lieu of a bribe, and who deprive the righteous of their right!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'>Therefore as the tongue of the fire devoureth the stubble, and dry hay sinketh before the flame: so shall their root be as rotten things, and their blossom shall fly up as the dust; because they have despised the law of the Lord of hosts, and the word of the Holy One of Israel they have rejected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'>For this cause is kindled the anger of the Lord against his people, and he stretcheth forth his hand against them, and he smiteth them; and the mountains tremble, and their carcasses lie like sweepings in the midst of the streets: with all this his anger is not turned away, but still is his hand stretched out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'>And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar, and will call for one of them from the end of the earth; and, behold, with speed, swiftly, it cometh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'>There is none weary, nor stumbling among its men; it slumbereth not, it sleepeth not; not loosened is the girdle of its loins, not broken is the latchet of its shoes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'>Whose arrows are sharpened, and all whose bows are bent; its horses hoofs are hard like the flint, and its wheels like the whirlwind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'>It hath a roar like the lioness, it roareth like the young lions: yea, it growleth, and layeth hold of the prey, and carrieth it safely off, with none to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'>And it will rage against them on that day like with the raging of the sea: and if one look unto the earth, behold, there is darkness, oppression, and the light is darkened through the darkness of its clouds.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'>In the year of king Uzziyahus death I saw the Lord sitting upon a high and exalted throne, and his train filled the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'>Seraphim were standing around him, each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two did he fly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.3'>And one called unto the other, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.4'>And the posts of the threshold shook at the voice of those that called aloud, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.5'>And I said, Woe is me! for I am lost; because a man of unclean lips am I, and in the midst of a people of unclean lips do I dwell; for the King, the Lord of hosts have my eyes seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.6'>Then flew unto me one of the seraphim, and in his hand was a live coal, with the tongs had he taken it from off the altar:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.7'>And he touched therewith upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thy iniquity is departed, and thy sin is forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.8'>And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? And I said, Here am I: send me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.9'>And he said, Go, and say unto this people, Hear indeed, but understand not; and see indeed, but know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.10'>Obdurate will remain the heart of this people, and their ears will be heavy, and their eyes will be shut: so that they will not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor their hearts be understanding, so that they be converted, and healing be granted them.</verse>
