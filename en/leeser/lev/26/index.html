for I am the Eternal your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>My sabbaths shall ye keep, and my sanctuary shall ye reverence: I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If in my statutes ye walk, and if my commandments ye keep, and do them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then will I give you rains in their due season, and the earth shall yield her products, and the tree of the field shall yield its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the threshing shall reach with you unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto sowingtime; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and ye shall dwell in safety in your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, with none to make you afraid; and I will remove evil beasts out of the land, and the sword shall not pass through your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will turn myself unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you; and I will establish my covenant with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And ye shall eat very old store, and the old shall ye remove away because of the new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will set my dwelling among you; and my soul shall not loath you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will walk among you, and I will be to you a God, and ye shall be to me a people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am the Eternal your God, who have brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and caused you to walk upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if my statutes ye despise, and if my ordinances your soul loath, so as not to do all my commandments, in that ye break my covenant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then will I also do this unto you, and I will inflict on you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart; and ye shall sow in vain your seed, for your enemies shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be struck down before your enemies: and they that hate you shall bear rule over you; and ye shall flee while there is no one pursuing you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if with these things even ye will not yet hearken unto me: then will I chastise you yet more, sevenfold for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as copper:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And in vain shall your strength be spent; for your land shall not yield her products, and the tree of the land shall not yield its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if ye walk yet contrary unto me, and if you refuse to hearken unto me: then will I bring more plagues upon you, sevenfold according to your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will send out against you the beasts of the field, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and diminish yourselves; so that your roads shall be desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And if notwithstanding these things ye will not be reformed by me, and walk contrary unto me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and I also will punish you, sevenfold for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will bring over you the sword, avenging the quarrel of my covenant, so that ye shall be gathered together within your cities; and then will I send the pestilence among you, that ye shall deliver yourselves into the hand of the enemy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When I break unto you the staff of bread; and ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if notwithstanding this ye will not hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then will I also walk contrary unto you in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you, sevenfold for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will destroy your highplaces, and cut down your sunimages, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols; and my soul shall loath you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will render your cities a waste, and I will make desolate your sanctuaries, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I will surely make desolate the land: and your enemies who dwell therein shall be astonished at it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out after you the sword; and your land shall be a desolate wild, and your cities shall be a waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then shall the land satisfy its sabbaths, all the days of its desolation, when ye are in the land of your enemies: then shall the land rest, and satisfy its sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>All the days of its desolation shall it rest, the time which it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And regarding those that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a leaf shaken shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from the sword; and they shall fall with none pursuing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they shall stumble one over the other, as before the sword, without one pursuing: and ye shall have no power to stand up before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And ye shall be lost among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall consume you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in the land of your enemies; and also through the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they shall then confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, that through their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that because they had walked contrary unto me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I also had to walk contrary unto them, and to bring them into the land of their enemies; and then shall their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and then shall they satisfy their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I will then remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and the land will I remember.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For the land shall be forsaken by them, and shall satisfy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them, and they shall satisfy their iniquity; because, even because my ordinances they despised, and my statutes their soul loathed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And yet for all that, though they be in the land of their enemies, will I not cast them away, neither will I loath them, to destroy them utterly, to break my covenant with them; for I am the Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But I will remember for their sakes the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations, that I might be unto them a God: I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which the Lord made between him and the children of Israel on mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
