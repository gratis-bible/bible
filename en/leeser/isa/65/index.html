These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, it is written before me; I will not keep silence, till I have recompensed, yea, recompensed into their bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the Lord, who have burnt incense upon the mountains, and upon the hills have blasphemed me: and I will measure out their work at first into their bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus hath said the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster of grapes, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it; so will I do for the sake of my servants, that I will not destroy the whole;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I let come forth out of Jacob a seed, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Sharon shall become a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a restingplace for herds, for my people that have sought me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But ye who forsake the Lord, who forget my holy mountain, that set out a table for the god of Fortune, and that fill for Destiny the drinkoffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yea, I will destine you to the sword, and all of you shall kneel down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spoke, ye did not hear; but ye did what is evil in my eyes, and that wherein I had no delight did ye choose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be made ashamed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry out from pain of heart, and from a broken spirit shall ye howl;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And ye shall leave behind your name for an oath unto my elect ones, when the Lord Eternal will slay thee; but his servants will he call by another name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Whoever there be that blesseth himself on the earth shall bless himself by the true God; and that sweareth on the earth shall swear by the true God; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But be ye glad and rejoice unto all eternity in what I create; for, behold, I will create Jerusalem for rejoicing, and her people for gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will rejoice over Jerusalem, and be glad in my people: and there shall not be heard in her any more the voice of weeping, nor the voice of complaint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There shall no more come thence an infant of few days, nor an old man that shall not have the full length of his days; for as a lad shall one die a hundred years old; and as a sinner shall be accursed he who dieth at a hundred years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat; for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and the work of their hands shall my elect wear out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They shall not toil in vain, nor bring forth unto an early death; for the seed of the blessed of the Lord are they, and their offspring with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it shall come to pass, that before yet they call will I answer; and while they are still speaking will I hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall like the bullock eat straw: and the serpentdust shall be his food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
