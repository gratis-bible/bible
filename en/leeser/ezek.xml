      <chapter osisID='Ezek.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>And it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was in the midst of the exiles by the river Kebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw divine visions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>On the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of the exile of king Jehoyachin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>Came the word of the Lord expressly unto Ezekiel the son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Kebar; and there came upon him there the inspiration of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>And I saw, and behold, a stormwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a flaming fire, and a brightness was on it round about; and out of the midst of it was like the glitter of amber, out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>And out of the midst thereof I saw the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: They had the likeness of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calfs foot: and they sparkled like the glitter of burnished copper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>And hands of man were visible from beneath their wings on their four sides: and their faces and their wings were alike on all these four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>Their wings were joined one to the other: they turned not about in their going; they went every one in the direction of one of their faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man; and the face of a lion, on the right side for all four of them; and the face of an ox on the left side for all four of them; and the face of an eagle for all four of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>Thus were their faces: and their wings were spread out upward; every one had two joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>And they went every one in the direction of one of his faces: whither the spirit was directed to go, they went; they turned not about in their going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like coals of fire, burning as with the appearance of torches; this fire it was which passed along between the living creatures: and a brightness was about the fire, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>And the living creatures ran backward and forward like the appearance of a flash of lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>And I looked on the living creatures, and, behold, there was one wheel upon the earth close by the living creatures, by their four front faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>The appearance of the wheels and their work was like the color of a chrysolite; and all four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as though it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>Toward their four sides they went in their going: they turned not round in their going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>As for their circumferences, they were so high that they excited fear: and their felloes were full of eyes round about on all these four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went near to them: and when the living creatures lifted themselves up from the earth, the wheels lifted themselves up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; for thither was their spirit to go: and the wheels lifted themselves up at the same time with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those lifted themselves up from the earth, the wheels lifted themselves up at the same time with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>And the likeness of a vault was over the head of the living creatures, shining like the glitter of the purest crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>And under the vault their wings were straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered them, and every one had two, which covered them,namely, their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>And I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, when they went, the sound of their speech, as the noise of an army: when they stood still, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>And there was a voice from the vault that was over their head: when they stood still, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>And above the vault that was over their head was like the appearance of a sapphirestone, the likeness of a throne: and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>And I saw as if it were the glitter of amber, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins upward; and from the appearance of his loins downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about: this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one that spoke.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>And he said unto me, Son of man, stand up upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>And a spirit entered into me as he spoke unto me, and it placed me upon my feet, and I heard him that spoke unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to rebellious tribes that have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even until this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>And the children are impudent of face, and obdurate of heart: I send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are a rebellious family, shall yet know that a prophet hath been among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>And thou, son of man,thou shalt not be afraid of them, and of their words thou shalt have no fear, though they be briers and thorns with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: of their words be not afraid, and at their presence be not dismayed; for they are a rebellious family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are rebellious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>But thou, son of man, hear what I am speaking unto thee, Be not thou rebellious like this rebellious family: open thy mouth, and eat what I give unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>And then I looked, and behold, a hand was stretched out toward me; and, lo, a rollbook was therein;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>And he spread it out before me; and it was written within and without: and there were written therein lamentations, and dirges, and woe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>And he said unto me, Son of man, eat what thou findest: eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat this roll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>And he said unto me, Son of man, feed thy belly, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I am giving unto thee. And I ate it; and it was in my mouth like honey in sweetness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>For not to a people of an obscure speech and of a difficult tongue art thou sent, but to the house of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>Not to many people of an obscure speech and of a difficult tongue, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would truly have hearkened unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me; for all the house of Israel have a bold forehead, and a hard heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>Behold, I have made thy face strong against their face, and thy forehead strong against their forehead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: thou shalt not fear them, nor shalt thou be dismayed at their presence, though they be a rebellious family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>And he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I will speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear them with thy ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>And go, get thee to those in exile, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal: whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>Then a spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>I heard also the sound of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the sound of the wheels at the same time with them, and the sound of a great rushing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>So a spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I walked in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the inspiration of the Lord was strong upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>Then came I to the exiles at Telabib, who dwelt by the river Kebar, and I remained where they dwelt, and I remained there in a state of confusion among them seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, That the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: and thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth, and give them warning from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou dost not give him warning, and speakest not to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life: the same wicked man shall die through his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>But thou,if thou hast warned the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way: he shall indeed die in his iniquity; but thou hast surely delivered thy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>Again, When a righteous man do turn from his righteousness, and do what is wrong: then will I lay a stumblingblock before him, so that he shall die; yet if thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his acts of righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require from thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>But if thou hast truly warned him,the righteous, that the righteous should not sin, and he doth not sin: he shall surely live, because he attended to the warning, and thou hast surely delivered thy own soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>And the inspiration of the Lord came there over me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the valley, and there will I speak with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>And I arose, and went forth into the valley; and, behold, there was the glory of the Lord standing, like that glory which I had seen by the river Kebar: and I fell down on my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>Then entered a spirit into me, and placed me upright on my feet, and spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself up within thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>But thou, O son of man, behold, they put ropes upon thee, and bind thee with them, that thou canst not go out among them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>And I will let thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not become to them a man who reproveth; for they are a rebellious family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forebear; for they are a rebellious family.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.1'>But thou, O son of man, take thyself a tile, and lay it before thee, and engrave upon it a city, namely, Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.2'>And place around it a siege, and build works of attack against it, and cast up a mound against it; and arrange around it encampments, and place against it battering rams round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.3'>Moreover take thou unto thyself an iron pan, and set it up as a wall of iron between thee and the city: and direct thy face against it, that it may be placed in a state of siege, and lay siege against it. This shall be a sign for the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.4'>And as for thyself, lie upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: after the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it shalt thou bear their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.5'>But as for myself, I lay upon thee the years of their iniquity, after the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.6'>And when thou hast made an end of them, thou shalt lie on thy right side, the second time, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: a day each for a year, a day for a year do I lay it on thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.7'>And toward the siege of Jerusalem shalt thou direct thy face with thy arm uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.8'>And, behold, I will lay ropes upon thee, that thou mayest not turn thyself from one side to the other, till thou hast made an end of the days of thy siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.9'>But thou take unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thyself bread thereof, after the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days, shalt thou eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.10'>And thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels for every day: from one time to the other time shalt thou eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.11'>And water shalt thou drink by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from one time to the other time shalt thou drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.12'>And in form of a barleycake shalt thou eat it, and this shalt thou bake with balls of human excrement before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.13'>And the Lord said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations whither I will drive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.14'>Then said I, Ah Lord Eternal! behold, my soul hath not been defiled; and that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces, have I never eaten from my youth up even until now; and never is flesh of abomination come into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.15'>Then said he unto me, Lo, I have given thee cows dung instead of human excrement; and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereupon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.16'>And he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem; and they shall eat bread by weight, and with anxious care; and they shall drink water by measure, and in confusion;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.17'>In order that they may want bread and water, and be confounded one with the other, and pine away for their iniquity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.1'>And thou, son of man, take unto thyself a sharp sword, a barbers razor shalt thou take for it unto thyself, and cause it to pass over thy head and over thy beard: then take unto thee balances for weighing, and divide the hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.2'>One third part shalt thou burn with fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are completed; and thou shalt take another third part, and smite it round about it with the sword; and the other third part shalt thou scatter to the wind: and I will draw out a sword after the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.3'>And take thence a few in number, and tie them up in the corners of thy garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.4'>And from these again shalt thou take some, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire: therefrom shall a fire go forth unto all the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.5'>Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, This is Jerusalem, which I had set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.6'>But she rebelled against my ordinances more wickedly than the nations, and against my statutes, more than the countries that are round about her; for my ordinances they have despised, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.7'>Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because ye have given yourselves up to evil more than the nations that are round about you, have not walked in my statutes, and have not executed my ordinances, and not even acted according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.8'>Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I, also I am against thee, and I will execute judgments in the midst of thee before the eyes of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.9'>And I will do in thee that which I have never done, and the like of which I will never do any more, because of all thy abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.10'>Therefore fathers shall devour their children in the midst of thee, and children shall devour their fathers: and I will execute judgments on thee, and I will scatter all thy remnant unto all the winds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.11'>Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Eternal, Surely, because thou hast made unclean my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thy abominations: therefore will I also diminish thee; and my eye shall not show pity, and I also will not spare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.12'>A third part of thee shall die through the pestilence, and come through famine to their end in the midst of thee; and another third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and the other third part will I scatter unto all the winds, and a sword will I draw out after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.13'>Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will satisfy myself: and they shall know that I the Lord have spoken it in my zeal, when I have let out all my fury on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.14'>Yea, I will render thee a ruin, and a disgrace among the nations that are round about thee, before the eyes of every one that passeth by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.15'>And she shall be a disgrace and a taunt, a warning and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I execute judgments on thee in anger and in fury and in furious chastisements,I the Lord have spoken it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.16'>When I send out among them the dreadful arrows of famine, which ever were the cause of destruction, which I will send out to destroy you; and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break unto you the staff of bread:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.17'>So will I let loose over you famine and wild beasts, and they shall make thee childless; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and the sword will I bring over thee. I the Lord have spoken it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.1'>And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.2'>Son of man, set thy face against the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.3'>And thou shalt say, O mountains of Israel, hear ye the word of the Lord Eternal! Thus hath said the Lord Eternal to the mountains, and to the hills, to the brooks, and to the valleys, Behold, I, even I, will bring over you the sword, and I will destroy your highplaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.4'>And your altars shall be made desolate, and your sunimages shall be broken: and I will cause your slain ones to fall before your idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.5'>And I will lay the carcasses of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.6'>In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid in ruins, and the highplaces shall be made desolate; in order that your altars may be laid in ruins and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and annihilated, and your sunimages may be cut down, and your works may be blotted out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.7'>And the slain shall fall in the midst of you: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.8'>Yet will I leave some; that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered in the various countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.9'>And those of you that escape shall remember me among the nations among whom they shall have been carried captive, when I shall have broken their licentious heart, which had departed from me, even with their eyes, which were gone astray after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves on account of the evil deeds which they have committed with all their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.10'>And they shall know that I am the Lord: not for naught have I spoken that I would do unto them this evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.11'>Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Strike thy hands together, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the dreadful abominations of the house of Israel! who will have to fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.12'>He that is afar off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I let out all my fury on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.13'>And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when their slain ones shall lie in the midst of their idols round about their altars, on every high hill, upon all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thickbranched oak,places where they presented sweet savor to all their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.14'>And I will stretch out my hand over them, and I will render the land desolate and waste, more than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.1'>And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.2'>And thou, son of man, thus hath said the Lord Eternal concerning the land of Israel, There is an end! the end is coming over the four corners of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.3'>Now cometh the end over thee, and I will let loose my anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and I will lay upon thee all thy abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.4'>And my eye shall not show pity upon thee, and I will not spare thee; for thy own ways will I lay upon thee, and thy abominations shall come in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.5'>Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, An evil, a peculiar evil, behold, is coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.6'>An end is coming, there is coming the end: it waketh up against thee; behold, the evil cometh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.7'>The evil decree is come against thee, O thou inhabitant of the land: the time is come, near is the day of tumult, and not the joyful call on the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.8'>Now will I in a short time pour out my fury over thee, and I will let out all my anger against thee, and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and I will lay upon thee all thy abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.9'>And my eye shall not show pity, and I will not spare: according to thy ways will I lay evil on thee, and thy abominations shall come in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the Lord that smiteth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.10'>Behold the day, behold, it is coming; the evil decree is gone forth; the staff hath blossomed, presumption hath budded;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.11'>The violence is grown up into the staff of wickedness: nothing is left of them, and nothing of their multitude, and nothing of theirs; and there shall be no lamenting for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.12'>The time is coming, the day occurreth; let the buyer not rejoice, and let the seller not mourn; for wrath is against all her multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.13'>For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although their soul were yet alive; for the vision is against all her multitude; no one shall return; but the soul of every one is fastened to his iniquity, they do not strengthen themselves to repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.14'>They have blown the cornet, every one maketh himself ready; but no one goeth to the battle; for my wrath is against all her multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.15'>The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine are within: he that is in the field shall die by the sword; and he that is in the city, him shall famine and pestilence devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.16'>But they that escape of them shall escape, and they shall be on the mountains like the doves of the valleys, all of which are moaning, every one in his iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.17'>All hands become feeble, and all knees go into water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.18'>And people gird themselves with sackcloth, and shuddering covereth them: and upon all faces there is shame, and upon all their heads there is baldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.19'>Their silver shall they cast into the streets, and their gold shall be as though it were unclean: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them on the day of the wrath of the Lord; they shall not satisfy their souls, and not fill their bowels; because it was the stumblingblock for their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.20'>And as for the beauty of his ornament, which he had instituted for their pride: even therein did they make the images of their abominations, their detestable things; therefore have I rendered it unclean for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.21'>And I will give it up into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil: and they shall pollute it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.22'>And I will turn away my face from them, and they shall pollute my place where I dwelt in secret; and therein shall barbarians enter and pollute it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.23'>Make chains; for the land is full of bloodguiltiness, and the city is full of violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.24'>Therefore will I bring the worst of nations, and they shall take possession of their houses: I will also cause the pride of the mighty to cease; and their holy places shall be polluted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.25'>Destruction cometh: and they will seek peace, but there shall be none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.26'>Mishap shall come upon mishap, and report shall be spread upon report: and then will they seek a vision from the prophet; but the law shall be lost from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.27'>The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with distress, and the hands of the people of the land shall be powerless: after their way will I do unto them, and according to their own manners will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.8'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.1'>And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, that I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me; and there fell upon me there the inspiration of the Lord Eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.2'>And I saw, and, behold, there was a likeness similar to the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins downward, it was fire; and from his loins upward, it was similar to the appearance of a bright light, like the glitter of amber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.3'>And he stretched forth the form of a hand, and took me by the locks of my head; and a spirit bore me between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.4'>And, behold, there was the glory of the God of Israel, like the appearance which I had seen in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.5'>And he said unto me, Son of man, do but lift up thy eyes in the direction toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes in the direction toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar there was this image of jealousy at the entrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.6'>Then said he unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they are doing? great abominations are they that the house of Israel commit here, to make me go far away from my sanctuary; but thou shalt yet see still other great abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.7'>And he brought me to the door of the court: and I looked, and behold there was a hole in the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.8'>Then said he unto me, Son of man, do break an opening in the wall: and I broke an opening in the wall, and, behold, there was a door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.9'>And he said unto me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations which they are doing here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.10'>So I went in and saw; and behold there was every form of creeping things, and cattle, abominations, and all the idols of the house of Israel, engraven upon the wall all round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.11'>And seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and Yaazanyahu the son of Shaphan standing in the midst of them, were standing before them, and every man had his censer in his hand; and a thick curling cloud of incense was ascending upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.12'>Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, every man in his imagechambers? for they say, The Lord seeth us not: the Lord hath forsaken the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.13'>And he said unto me, Thou shalt yet again see still other great abominations that they are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.14'>And he brought me to the entrance of the gate of the Lords house which was on the north side: and, behold, there sat the women weeping for Thammuz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.15'>Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Thou shalt yet again see still other greater abominations than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.16'>And he brought me into the inner court of the Lords house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they were prostrating themselves eastward to the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.17'>Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and they constantly repeat to provoke me to anger; and, lo, they stretch forth the branch to their nose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.18'>Therefore I also will deal in fury; my eye shall not look with pity, and I will not spare: and though they call before my ears with a loud voice, will I still not hear them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.9'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.1'>And he called before my ears with a loud voice, saying, Let those come near that have charge to punish the city, and every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.2'>And, behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which is turned toward the north, and every man with his weapon of destruction in his hand; and one man in the midst of them was clothed in linen, with a writers materials by his side: and they went in, and placed themselves beside the copper altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.3'>And the glory of the God of Israel ascended up from the cherub, whereupon it had been, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writers materials by his side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.4'>And the Lord said unto him, Pass through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and inscribe a mark upon the foreheads of the men who sigh and who complain because of all the abominations which are done in the midst of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.5'>And to the others he said before my ears, Pass ye through the city after him, and smite: let your eye not look with pity, and do not spare;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.6'>The aged, youth, and virgin, and little children, and women shall ye slay and destroy; but come not near any man upon whom the mark is; and at my sanctuary shall ye begin. Then they began with the ancient men who were before the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.7'>And he said unto them, Make unclean the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go forth. And they went forth, and they smote in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.8'>And it came to pass, while they were smiting them, and I alone was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried out, and said, Ah Lord Eternal! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel when thou pourest out thy fury over Jerusalem?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.9'>Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and of Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of bloodguiltiness, and the city full of injustice; for they have said, The Lord hath forsaken the land, and the Lord seeth not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.10'>And as for me also, my eye shall not look with pity, and I will not spare; but I will bring their course upon their own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.11'>And, behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the writing materials by his side, brought back word, saying, I have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.10'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.1'>Then I saw, and, behold, on the vault that was above the head of the cherubim, there appeared over them something like a sapphire stone, something similar in appearance to the likeness of a throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.2'>And he said unto the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, under the cherub, and fill thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and throw them over the city. And he went in before my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.3'>Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the house, when the man went in: and the cloud filled the inner court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.4'>Then the glory of the Lord rose upward from the cherub, toward the threshold of the house: and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the Lords glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.5'>And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.6'>And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside the wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.7'>And the one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and lifted it up, and placed it into the hands of the one clothed in linen; who took it, and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.8'>And there became visible on the cherubim the form of a mans hand beneath their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.9'>And I saw, and, behold, there were four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by the one cherub, and another wheel by the other cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was like the glitter of a chrysolite stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.10'>And as for their appearances, the whole four had one likeness, as if a wheel were in the midst of another wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.11'>In their going, they went toward their four sides, they turned not round in their going; but to the place whither the head was turned they followed it, they turned not round in their going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.12'>And their whole body, and their back, and their hands, and their wings, as also the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that belonged to all four of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.13'>As for the wheels, they were called Galgal before my ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.14'>And every one had four faces: the one face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face was the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.15'>And the cherubim lifted themselves up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river Kebar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.16'>And when the cherubim went forward, the wheels went close by them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also did not turn away from beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.17'>When those halted, these halted; and when those lifted themselves up, these lifted themselves up with them; for the spirit of the living creature was in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.18'>And the glory of the Lord went forth from off the threshold of the house, and halted over the cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.19'>And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth before my eyes as they went forth, and the wheels at the same time with them, and halted at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the Lord: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.20'>This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Kebar; and I understood that they were cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.21'>Every one had four faces apiece, and every one had four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.22'>And the likeness of their faces was the same as the faces which I had seen by the river Kebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one in the direction of his face.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.11'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.1'>And a spirit bore me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the house of the Lord, which looketh eastward: and behold, there were at the entrance of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Yaazanyah the son of Azzur, and Pelatyahu the son of Benayahu, princes of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.2'>Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise wickedness, and give evil counsel in this city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.3'>Who say, The evil is not near; so let us build houses: this city is the pot, and we are the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.4'>Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.5'>And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak, Thus hath said the Lord, Thus have ye said, O house of Israel; and whatever cometh into your mind, do I know full well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.6'>Ye have multiplied those slain by you in this city, and ye have filled its streets with the slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.7'>Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Those slain by you whom ye have struck down in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this place is the pot; but you are to be removed out of the midst of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.8'>The sword have ye feared: and the sword will I bring over you, saith the Lord Eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.9'>And I will remove you out of the midst of it, and I will give you up into the hand of strangers, and will execute punishments among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.10'>By the sword shall ye fall; on the boundary of Israel will I judge you: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.11'>This place shall not be unto you as a pot, so that you should be as flesh in the midst of it; but on the boundary of Israel will I judge you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.12'>And ye shall know that I am the Lord: because in my statutes have ye not walked, and my ordinances have ye not executed; but ye have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.13'>And it came to pass, as I was prophesying, that Pelatyahu the son of Benayah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Eternal! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.14'>Then came the word of the Lord unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.15'>Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and the whole house of Israel altogether, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Remain you far from the Lord: unto us is this land given for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.16'>Therefore say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Although I have removed them far away among the nations, and although I have scattered them among the countries: yet will I be to them as a minor sanctuary in the countries whither they are come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.17'>Therefore say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will both gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries whether ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.18'>And they shall come thither, and they shall remove all its detestable things, and all its abominations out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.19'>And I will give them one single heart, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will remove the heart of stone out of their body, and I will give unto them a heart of flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.20'>In order that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them; and they shall be unto me for a people, and I will indeed be unto them for a God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.21'>But as for those whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, their way do I bring upon their own head, saith the Lord Eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.22'>Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels at the same time with them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.23'>And the glory of the Lord ascended from the midst of the city, and halted upon the mount which is on the east side of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.24'>But a spirit bore me up, and brought me into Chaldea, to those in exile, in the appearance through the spirit of God: and then ascended away from me the appearance which I had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.25'>Then did I speak unto those in exile all the things that the Lord had shown me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.12'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.1'>The word of the Lord came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.2'>Son of man, in the midst of a rebellious family art thou dwelling, who have eyes to see, and see not; who have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.3'>But thou, O son of man, prepare for thyself vessels for going into exile, and wander away by day before their eyes; and thou shalt wander away from thy place to another place before their eyes: perhaps they may become aware that they are a rebellious family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.4'>Then shalt thou carry forth thy vessels, like vessels of exile, by day before their eyes: and thou shalt go forth at evening before their eyes, as they do that go forth into exile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.5'>Before their eyes break a hole through the wall, and carry them through it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.6'>Before their eyes shalt thou bear them upon thy shoulders, in the dark shalt thou carry them forth: thy face shalt thou cover, that thou mayest not see the ground; for as a token have I set thee unto the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.7'>And I did so as I had been commanded; my vessels I carried forth by day, like vessels of exile, and in the evening I broke a hole for myself through the wall with my hand: in the dark I brought them forth, and I bore them upon my shoulder before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.8'>And the word of the Lord came unto me in the morning, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.9'>Son of man, have not the house of Israel, the rebellious family, said unto thee, What doest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.10'>Say thou unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, For the prince in Jerusalem is the doom, and for all the house of Israel, and those that are in the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.11'>Say, I am your token; just as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: into exile, into captivity, shall they wander.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.12'>And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth; through the wall shall they break a hole to carry things through it: his face shall he cover up, that he may not see the ground with his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.13'>And I will spread out my net over him, and he shall be caught in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon into the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, and there shall he die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.14'>And all that are round about him, those who assist him, and all the wings of his armies will I disperse toward every wind; and the sword will I draw out after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.15'>And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.16'>But I will leave of them men few in number from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence: in order that they may relate all their abominations among the nations whither they shall have come; and they shall know that I am the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.17'>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.18'>Son of man, thy bread shalt thou eat with quaking, and thy water shalt thou drink with trembling and with anxious care.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.19'>And thou shalt say unto the people of the land, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and concerning the land of Israel, Their bread shall they eat with anxious care, and their water shall they drink with confusion, for the cause that her land will be desolate, deprived of its plenteousness because of the violence of all those that dwell therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.20'>And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid in ruins, and the land shall be made desolate: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.21'>And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.22'>Son of man, what sort of proverb is that which ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are lasting long, and lost is every vision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.23'>Therefore say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will cause this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but speak unto them, The days are coming nigh, and the word of every vision.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.6'>Clothed as they were in blue, governors, and rulers, attractive youths all of them, horsemen riding upon horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.7'>Thus she played the harlot with them, all of them the chosen ones of the sons of Asshur: and with all for whom she longed,with all their idols did she defile herself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.8'>But also her lewdness from Egypt forsook she not; for they had lain with her in her youth, and they had touched her virgin bosom, and had lavished their lewd caresses on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.9'>Therefore did I give her up into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the sons of Asshur, after whom she longed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.10'>These were they that laid open her nakedness; her sons and her daughters did they take away, and her they slew with the sword: and she became infamous among women, when they inflicted the decreed punishments on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.11'>And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she became more corrupt in her longing than she, and in her lewd acts more than her sisters lewdness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.14'>But she added still more to her acts of lewdness; for when she saw men engraved upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with color,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.15'>Bound with girdles on their loins, with hanging down colored turbans on their heads, in appearance like commanders, all of them, in the likeness of the sons of Babylon of the Chaldeans, the land of their birth:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.30'>I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone with vile lust after the nations, because thou hast defiled thyself with their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.31'>On the way of thy sister hast thou walked; therefore will I place her cup into thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.32'>Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, The cup of thy sister shalt thou drink, the deep and wide one: thou shalt become to be laughed to scorn and to be held in derision, more than thou canst bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.33'>With drunkenness and sorrow shalt thou be filled, out of the cup of astonishment and confusion, the cup of thy sister Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.34'>Thou shalt even drink it and drain it out, and thou shalt break in pieces its fragments, and tear thy own breasts; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.35'>Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back: therefore bear thou also thy incest and thy acts of lewdness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.1'>In the five and twentieth year of our exile, in the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city had been smitten, on the selfsame day came the inspiration of the Lord upon me, and brought me thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.2'>In the visions of God brought he me unto the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mount, on which there was built something like a city on the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.3'>And when he had brought me thither, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of copper, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuringrod: and he was standing in the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.4'>And the man spoke unto me, Son of man, behold with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears, and direct thy heart unto all that I am about to show thee; for in order to show it unto thee art thou brought hither: tell all that thou seest to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.5'>And behold there was a wall on the outside of the house all round about, and in the mans hand was a measuringrod of six cubits long by the cubit which was a hands breadth longer than usual; and he measured the breadth of the building, one rod, and the height, one rod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.6'>Then came he unto the gate which looked in the direction toward the east, and went up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one rod in breadth, and the other threshold one rod in breadth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.7'>And every cell was one rod long, and one rod broad; and between the cells were five cubits: and the threshold of the gate near by the porch of the gate within was one rod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.8'>He measured also the porch of the gate within, one rod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.9'>Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits, and its doorposts, two cubits: and the porch of the gate was inward.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.17'>Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court all round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.21'>And its cells were three on this side and three on that side; and its doorposts and its porches were after the measure of the first gate: fifty cubits was its length, and its breadth five and twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.22'>And its windows, and its porches, and their palmshaped capitals, were after the measure of the gate that looked in an eastern direction: and by seven steps did they go up unto it, and to its porches which were before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.23'>And the gates of the inner court were opposite the gates on the north, and on the east: and he measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.25'>And there were windows in it and in its porches all round about, like the other windows: it was fifty cubits in length, and in breadth five and twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.26'>And by seven steps was the ascent to it, and to its porches which were before them; and it had palmshaped capitals, one on this side, and another on that side, upon its doorposts.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.33'>And its cells and its doorposts, and its porches, were according to these measures; and there were windows in it and in its porches all round about: its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth five and twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.34'>And its porches were toward the outward court; and palmshaped capitals were upon its doorposts, on this side, and on that side: and by eight steps was the ascent to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.35'>And he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it after these measures;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.38'>And there was a chamber with its door by the doorposts of the gates, where they washed off the burntofferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.39'>And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slaughter thereon the burntofferings and the sinofferings and the trespassofferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.40'>And at the side without the porch, as one went up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.41'>Four tables being on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate, eight tables, whereupon they slaughtered the sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.42'>And there were four tables of hewn stone for the burntofferings, of a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slaughtered the burntofferings and the sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.43'>And hooks, a hand long, were fastened within all round about: and on the tables was placed the flesh of the offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.44'>And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their front was toward the south side: one was at the side of the east gate having the front toward the north side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.45'>And he spoke unto me, This chamber, the front of which is toward the south, is for the priests who have the charge of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.46'>And the chamber, the front of which is toward the north, is for the priests who have the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who come near, from among the sons of Levi, to the Lord to minister unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.47'>So he measured the court, in length one hundred cubits, and in breadth one hundred cubits, foursquare: and the altar stood before the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.48'>And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each doorpost of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.49'>The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, together with the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the doorposts, one on this side, and another on that side.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.41'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.1'>And he brought me to the temple: and he measured the doorposts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, as also the breadth of the tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.2'>And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured its length, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.3'>Then went he inward, and measured the posts of the door, two cubits; and the door was six cubits high; and the breadth of the door, was seven cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.4'>And he measured its length, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, fronting on the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.5'>After this he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every sidechamber was four cubits, all round about the house on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.6'>And the sidechambers were one over another, three and thirty times; and they entered into the wall which was on the house for the sidechambers all round about, that they might be fastened on, but they were not fastened on the wall of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.7'>And as one wound upward it became continually wider for the sidechambers; for the row of chambers about the house went more and more upward round about the house; therefore was the breadth of the house greater upward: and so they ascended from the lowest chambers to the highest through the middle ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.8'>And I saw the height of the house all round about: the foundations of the sidechambers were a full rod of six cubits under ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.9'>The thickness of the wall, which was for the sidechambers without, was five cubits, as also the space which was left open by the row of the sidechambers that were on the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.10'>And between the chambers there was a width of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.11'>And the doors of the sidechambers were on the open space, one door was in a northern direction, and another door on the south; and the breadth of the place that was left open was five cubits all round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.12'>Now the building that was before the main wing on the west side was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and its length, ninety cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.13'>So he measured the house, in length one hundred cubits; and the main wing, and the building, with its walls, in length one hundred cubits;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.16'>The thresholds, and the narrow windows, and the cornerpillars were round about on their three sides: opposite the threshold there was a wainscoting of wood all round about, and so from the ground up to the windows; and the windows were covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.17'>On the part above the door, and as far as the inner house, and the outer house, was a wainscoting, and on all the wall round about within and without, by the same measure;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.19'>So that a human face was toward the palmtree on the one side, and a young lions face toward the palmtree on the other side: it was so made on all the house round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.20'>From the ground to the part above the door were the cherubim and the palmtrees made, and so on the wall of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.21'>The temple had fourcornered doorposts, and the front of the holy of holies had the same appearance as the appearance of the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.22'>The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length was two cubits; and its corners, and its toppiece, and its walls, were of wood: and he spoke unto me, This is the table that is before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.23'>And the temple and the holy of holies had two doors.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.1'>And he led me forth into the outer court, on the way to the north side; and he brought me into the row of chambers that was opposite the main wing, and which was opposite the building toward the north;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.2'>On the front side the length of which was a hundred cubits, up to the north door, while the breadth was fifty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.3'>Opposite the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and opposite the pavement which was for the outer court, was cornerpillar before cornerpillar in the three stories.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.10'>On the breadth of the wall of the court in an eastern direction before the main wing, and before the building, were chambers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.11'>And the way before them was of like appearance as that for the chambers which were on the north side, of the same length and the same breadth; and all their means of egress, and their arrangement, and their doors were of the like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.12'>And so also were the doors of the chambers that were on the south side, a door being on the head of the way, of the way directly before the wall on the east side, as one entereth into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.13'>And he said unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers which are in front of the main wing,these are the holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the Lord shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, namely, the meatoffering, and the sinoffering, and the trespassoffering; for the place is holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.14'>When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the sanctuary into the outer court; but there shall they lay down their garments wherein they may have ministered; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall then approach to the court which is for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.15'>Now when he had finished the measurings of the inner house, he led me forth by the way of the gate which looked in an eastern direction, and measured it all round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.16'>He measured the east side with the measuringrod, five hundred rods, with the measuringrod round about.</verse>
