And Moses prayed for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thyself a serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that whoever is bitten shall look at it, and he shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses made a serpent of copper, and put it upon a pole; and it came to pass, that, when a serpent had bitten any man, and he looked up to the serpent of copper, he remained alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the children of Israel set forward, and encamped in Oboth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Iyehaabarim, in the wilderness, which is before Moab, toward the rising of the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From there they set forward and encamped in the valley of Zered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From there they set forward, and encamped on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness, and which cometh out of the boundary of the Emorites; for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and between the Emorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore mention is made in the book of the wars of the Lord, of Vaheb in Supha, and of the brooks of Arnon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the descent of the brooks, that turneth toward ShebethAr, and leaneth upon the border of Moab;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from there to the well; this is the well where the Lord said unto Moses, Assemble the people and I will give them water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then did Israel sing this song, Come up, O well; sing ye unto it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Well, which the princes have dug, which the nobles of the people have hollowed out with the sceptre, with their staves; and from the wilderness to Mattanah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And from Mattanah to Nachaliel; and from Nachaliel to Bamoth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And from Bamoth to the valley, which is in the fields of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Israel sent messengers unto Sichon the king of the Emorites, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let me pass through thy land; we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink the water of a well: by the kings highway will we go along, until we have passed thy border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Sichon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border; and Sichon assembled all his people together; and went out against Israel into the wilderness; and he came to Yahaz, and fought against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from Arnon unto Yabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Israel took all these cities; and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Emorites, in Cheshbon, and in all the villages thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Cheshbon was the city of Sichon the king of the Emorites; and he had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, up to the Arnon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore said the poets, Come into Cheshbon, let the city of Sichon be built and established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For a fire is gone out of Cheshbon, a flame from the city of Sichon: it hath consumed ArMoab, the men of the high places of the Arnon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Woe to thee, Moab! thou art lost, O people of Kemosh: he hath suffered his sons to become fugitives, and his daughters to go into captivity, unto the king of the Emorites, Sichon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>We have thrown them down; lost is Cheshbon even unto Dibon, and we have laid waste all up to Nophach, which reacheth unto Medeba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Emorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Moses sent to spy out Yazer, and they captured the villages thereof, and drove out the Emorites that were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they turned and went up by the way to Bashan; and Og, the king of Bashan, went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Fear him not; for into thy hand have I delivered him, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do unto him as thou hast done unto Sichon, the king of the Emorites, who dwelt at Cheshbon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they smote him and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left unto him that escaped; and they took possession of his land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
