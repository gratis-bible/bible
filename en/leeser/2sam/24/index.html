And David said unto the Lord, I have sinned greatly in what I have done; and now, I beseech thee, O Lord, cause the iniquity of thy servant to pass away; for I have acted very foolishly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when David was arisen in the morning, The word of the Lord came unto Gad the prophet, Davids seer, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Go and speak unto David, Thus hath said the Lord, Three things do I offer thee: choose for thyself one of them, and I will do it unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Gad came to David, and told it unto him; and he said unto him, Shall there come unto thee seven years of famine in thy land? or three months, that thou flee before thy enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be for three days a pestilence in thy land? now consider and see what word I shall bring back to him that hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall then into the hand of the Lord,for his mercies are great; but let me not fall into the hand of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Lord sent a pestilence in Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the angel stretched out his hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord bethought himself of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed among the people, It is enough: now stay thy hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the threshingfloor of Aravnah the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David spoke unto the Lord when he saw the angel that smote among the people, and said, Lo, I have indeed sinned, and I have truly done wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Gad came to David on that day, and said unto him, Go up, erect an altar unto the Lord on the threshingfloor of Aravnah the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David went up, according to the word of Gad, as the Lord had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Aravnah looked up, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Aravnah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Aravnah said, Wherefore is my Lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy from thee the threshingfloor, to build an altar unto the Lord, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Aravnah said unto David, Let my Lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good in his eyes: behold, the oxen are here for burntofferings, and the threshing rollers and the harness of the oxen for wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these things did Aravnah, for the king, give unto the king. And Aravnah said unto the king, May the Lord thy God receive thee favorably.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king said unto Aravnah, No; but I will surely buy it from thee at the value; for I will not offer burntofferings unto the Lord my God without paying therefor. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burntofferings and peaceofferings: and the Lord was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
