        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God was waving over the face of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>And God saw the light that it was good; and God divided between the light and the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And it was evening and it was morning, the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>And God said, Let there be an expansion in the midst of the waters, and let it divide between waters and waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>And God made the expansion, and divided between the waters which were under the expansion and the waters which were above the expansion: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>And God called the expansion Heaven. And it was evening and it was morning, the second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land be visible: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, herbs yielding seed, fruittrees yielding fruit after their kind, in which its seed is upon the earth: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees yielding fruit, in which its seed is after their kind: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>And it was evening and it was morning, the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>And God said, Let there be lights in the expansion of the heaven to divide between the day and the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>And let them be for lights in the expansion of the heaven, to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and the stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>And God set them in the expansion of the heaven to give light upon the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>And to rule by day and by night, and to divide between the light and the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>And it was evening and it was morning, the fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly moving creatures that have life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open expansion of the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>And God created the great seamonsters, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after its kind: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the fowl multiply on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>And it was evening and it was morning, the fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'>And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and they shall have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'>And God created man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>And God said, Behold I have given unto you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree on which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the heaven, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for food: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'>And God saw every thing that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And it was evening and it was morning, the sixth day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>Thus were finished the heavens and the earth, and all their host.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>And God had finished on the seventh day his work which he had made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because thereon he had rested from all his work which God had created in making it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, on the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>And every plant of the field was not yet on the earth, and every herb of the field had not yet grown; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and man was not yet there to till the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>And the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden to the eastward, and he put there the man whom he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>And the Lord God caused to grow out of the ground every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food; and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it was parted, and became four principal streams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>The name of the first is Pishon, the same which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>And the gold of that land is good; there is the bdellium and the onyx stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>And the name of the second river is Gihon, the same which compasseth the whole land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>And the name of the third river is Hiddekel, the same which floweth towards the east of Assyria; and the fourth river is the Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to till it, and to keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for on the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help suitable for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>And the Lord God had formed out of the ground every beast of the field, and every fowl of the heaven, and he brought them unto the man to see what he would call them; and whatsoever the man would call every living creature, that should be its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the heaven, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help suitable for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>And the Lord God formed the rib which he had taken from the man into a woman, and brought her unto the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>And the man said, This time it is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; this shall be called Woman, Ishah, because out of Man Ishi was this one taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>Therefore doth a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave unto his wife, and they become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made; and he said unto the woman, Hath God indeed said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye will surely not die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>For God doth know, that, on the day ye eat thereof, your eyes will be opened, and ye will be as God, knowing good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they felt that they were naked; and they sewed figleaves together, and made themselves aprons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>And the Lord God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>And he said, Thy voice I heard in the garden; and I was afraid, because I am naked; and I hid myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>And he said, Who told thee that thou art naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, be thou cursed above all the cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt wound his heel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and the suffering of thy conception; in pain shalt thou bring forth children; and for thy husband shall be thy desire, but he shall rule over thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed be the ground for thy sake; in pain shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>And thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herbs of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>And the man called his wifes name Eve Chavvah; because she was the mother of all living Chay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>And the Lord God made unto Adam and to his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flaming sword which revolveth, to guard the way to the tree of life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>And the man knew Eve his wife: and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>And she bore again, his brother, Abel; and Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>And it came to pass in process of time, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>And Abelhe also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fattest thereof; and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>But unto Cain and to his offering he had no respect; and it was very displeasing to Cain, and his countenance fell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door; and unto thee is its desire, but thou canst rule over it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel they brother? and he said, I know not; am I my brothers keeper?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brothers blood crieth unto me from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>And now be thou cursed from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield its strength unto thee; fugitive and vagabond shalt thou be on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and if I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, it will come to pass, that every one that findeth me will slay me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a sign unto Cain, that any one finding him should not kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begat Mechujael: and Mechujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lemech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>And Lemech took unto himself two wives, the name of one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and have cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>And his brothers name was Jubal; he was the father of all such as play on the harp and guitar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an artificer in every article of copper and iron; and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>And Lemech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lemech, hearken unto my speech; for I have slain a man to my own wounding, and a youngman to my hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lemech seventy and sevenfold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Sheth Seth; for God said she hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>And to Sheth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh: then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.</verse>
