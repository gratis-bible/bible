        <verse osisID='Lev.26.1'>Ye shall not make yourselves any idols, and a graven image, or a standing image shall ye not rear up unto you, and any carved stone shall you not place in your land, to bow down upon it; for I am the Eternal your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.2'>My sabbaths shall ye keep, and my sanctuary shall ye reverence: I am the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.3'>If in my statutes ye walk, and if my commandments ye keep, and do them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.4'>Then will I give you rains in their due season, and the earth shall yield her products, and the tree of the field shall yield its fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.5'>And the threshing shall reach with you unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto sowingtime; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and ye shall dwell in safety in your land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.6'>And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, with none to make you afraid; and I will remove evil beasts out of the land, and the sword shall not pass through your land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.7'>And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.8'>And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.9'>And I will turn myself unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you; and I will establish my covenant with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.10'>And ye shall eat very old store, and the old shall ye remove away because of the new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.11'>And I will set my dwelling among you; and my soul shall not loath you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.12'>And I will walk among you, and I will be to you a God, and ye shall be to me a people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.13'>I am the Eternal your God, who have brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and caused you to walk upright.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.14'>But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.15'>And if my statutes ye despise, and if my ordinances your soul loath, so as not to do all my commandments, in that ye break my covenant:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.16'>Then will I also do this unto you, and I will inflict on you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart; and ye shall sow in vain your seed, for your enemies shall eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.17'>And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be struck down before your enemies: and they that hate you shall bear rule over you; and ye shall flee while there is no one pursuing you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.18'>And if with these things even ye will not yet hearken unto me: then will I chastise you yet more, sevenfold for your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.19'>And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as copper:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.20'>And in vain shall your strength be spent; for your land shall not yield her products, and the tree of the land shall not yield its fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.21'>And if ye walk yet contrary unto me, and if you refuse to hearken unto me: then will I bring more plagues upon you, sevenfold according to your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.22'>And I will send out against you the beasts of the field, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and diminish yourselves; so that your roads shall be desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.23'>And if notwithstanding these things ye will not be reformed by me, and walk contrary unto me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.24'>Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and I also will punish you, sevenfold for your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.25'>And I will bring over you the sword, avenging the quarrel of my covenant, so that ye shall be gathered together within your cities; and then will I send the pestilence among you, that ye shall deliver yourselves into the hand of the enemy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.26'>When I break unto you the staff of bread; and ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.27'>And if notwithstanding this ye will not hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.28'>Then will I also walk contrary unto you in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you, sevenfold for your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.29'>And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.30'>And I will destroy your highplaces, and cut down your sunimages, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols; and my soul shall loath you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.31'>And I will render your cities a waste, and I will make desolate your sanctuaries, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.32'>And I will surely make desolate the land: and your enemies who dwell therein shall be astonished at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.33'>And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out after you the sword; and your land shall be a desolate wild, and your cities shall be a waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.34'>Then shall the land satisfy its sabbaths, all the days of its desolation, when ye are in the land of your enemies: then shall the land rest, and satisfy its sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.35'>All the days of its desolation shall it rest, the time which it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.36'>And regarding those that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a leaf shaken shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from the sword; and they shall fall with none pursuing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.37'>And they shall stumble one over the other, as before the sword, without one pursuing: and ye shall have no power to stand up before your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.38'>And ye shall be lost among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall consume you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.39'>And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in the land of your enemies; and also through the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.40'>And they shall then confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, that through their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that because they had walked contrary unto me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.41'>I also had to walk contrary unto them, and to bring them into the land of their enemies; and then shall their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and then shall they satisfy their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.42'>And I will then remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and the land will I remember.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.43'>For the land shall be forsaken by them, and shall satisfy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them, and they shall satisfy their iniquity; because, even because my ordinances they despised, and my statutes their soul loathed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.44'>And yet for all that, though they be in the land of their enemies, will I not cast them away, neither will I loath them, to destroy them utterly, to break my covenant with them; for I am the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.45'>But I will remember for their sakes the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations, that I might be unto them a God: I am the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.46'>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which the Lord made between him and the children of Israel on mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lev.27'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.1'>And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.2'>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If a man make a particular vow, to give the estimated value of persons in honor of the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.3'>If the estimated value concern a male from twenty years old, and unto sixty years old, then shall the estimation be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.4'>And if it be a female, then shall the estimation be thirty shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.5'>And if the person be from five years old and unto twenty years old, then shall the estimation of the male be twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.6'>And if the person be from a month old and unto five years old, then shall the estimation of the male be five shekels of silver, and for the female the estimation shall be three shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.7'>And if the person be from sixty years old and upward, if it be a male, then shall the estimation be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.8'>But if he be too poor for this estimation, then shall he present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability to pay of him that hath vowed shall the priest value him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.9'>And if it he a beast, whereof men can bring an offering unto the Lord, all that a man giveth of such unto the Lord shall be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.10'>He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad one, or a bad for a good one; and if he should change beast for beast, then shall it together with its exchange be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.11'>And if it be any unclean beast, of which they cannot offer a sacrifice unto the Lord, then shall he present the beast before the priest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.12'>And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest valueth it, so shall it be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.13'>And if he will redeem it, then shall he add a fifth part thereof unto the estimated value.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.14'>And if a man sanctify his house as holy unto the Lord, then shall the priest value it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest may value it, so shall it stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.15'>And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then shall he add the fifth part of the money of the estimated value unto it, and it shall remain his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.16'>And if a man sanctify some part of a field of his possession unto the Lord, then shall the estimation be in proportion to its required seed: the seed of a chomer of barley at fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.17'>If immediately after the year of the jubilee he sanctify his field, according to this estimation shall it stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.18'>But if after the jubilee he sanctify his field, then shall the priest reckon unto him the money in proportion to the years that remain, until the year of the jubilee, and it shall be deducted from the estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.19'>And if he that sanctified the field will redeem it, then shall he add the fifth part of the money of the estimated value unto it, and it shall be assured to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.20'>But if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.21'>But the field, when it is freed in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord, as a devoted field: to the priest shall it belong as his possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.22'>And if a man sanctify a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession, unto the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.23'>Then shall the priest reckon unto him the amount of the estimated value to the year of the jubilee; and he shall give this estimation on that day, as a holy thing unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.24'>In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom he bought it, to the one to whom belongeth the possession of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.25'>And all estimations of value shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.26'>Only the firstborn which shall, by being first born, be sacred unto the Lord among cattle, no man shall sanctify; whether it be ox, or lamb, it is the Lords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.27'>And if it be an unclean animal, then shall he redeem it according to the estimated value, and he shall add its fifth part thereto; and if it be not redeemed, then shall it be sold according to the estimated value.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.28'>But any devoted thing, which a man may devote unto the Lord of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall not be sold nor redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.29'>Any one condemned, who shall be condemned to death among men, shall not be redeemed: he shall be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.30'>And every tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, belongeth to the Lord; it is holy unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.31'>And if a man will redeem any part of his tithe, its fifth part shall he add thereto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.32'>And concerning the tithe of the herds, or of the flocks, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.33'>He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he should change it, then both it and the exchange thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.34'>These are the commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses for the children on mount Sinai.</verse>
