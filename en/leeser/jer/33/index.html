For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Yet again shall there be in this place, which is ruined, without man and even without beast, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds who cause their flocks to lie down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the cities of the mountain, in the cities of the lowlands, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the environs of Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks yet pass again under the hands of him that counteth them, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will fulfill that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and respecting the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days, and at that time, will I cause to grow up unto David the sprout of righteousness: and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In those days shall Judah be helped, and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety: and this is what she shall be called, The Lord is our righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thus hath said the Lord, There shall never be wanting unto David a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And unto the priests the Levites there shall not be wanting a man before me, to offer burntofferings, and to burn meatofferings, and to prepare sacrifices at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus hath said the Lord, If ye can break my covenant with the day, and my covenant with the night, and so, that there be not day and night in their season:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then also shall my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and that with the Levites the priests, my ministers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, and the sand of the sea not be measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Hast thou not observed what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the Lord hath made choice of, even these hath he rejected: and they thus have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus hath said the Lord, If my covenant be not with day and night, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then also will I reject the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, so as not to take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
