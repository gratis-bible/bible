      <chapter osisID='Josh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'>And it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke unto Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'>Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, pass over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, to the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'>From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your boundary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'>No man shall be able to stand up before thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not let thee fail, nor forsake thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'>Be strong and of a good courage; for thou shalt divide for an inheritance unto this people the land, which I swore unto their fathers to give to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'>Only be thou strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant hath commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left; in order that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, in order that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein; for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and then shalt thou have good success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'>Behold, I have commanded thee, Be strong and of good courage; be not dismayed, neither be thou discouraged; for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'>Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare yourselves provisions; for after only three days more ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth you, to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Menasseh, spoke Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'>Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, The Lord your God hath granted you rest, and hath given you this land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan; but ye shall pass over armed before your brethren, all the mighty men of valor, and help them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'>Until the Lord shall have granted your brethren rest, as he hath done to you, and they also have taken possession of the land which the Lord your God giveth them: then shall ye return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on this side of the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'>And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us will we do, and whithersoever thou wilt send us will we go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'>Entirely so as we have hearkened unto Moses, thus will we hearken unto thee: only the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'>Every man that doth rebel against thy order, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou mayest command him, shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'>And Joshua, the son of Nun, had sent out from Shittim two men as spies, secretly, saying, Go ye, view the land and especially Jericho; and they went, and came unto the house of a woman, a harlot, whose name was Rachab, and they lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'>And it was told unto the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men came in hither this night, of the children of Israel, to search out the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'>And the king of Jericho sent to Rachab, saying, Bring forth the men who are come to thee, who came to thy house; for, to search out all the country are they come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'>But the woman had taken the two men, and hidden them; and she said, It is true, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'>And it came to pass, about the time of shutting the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; I know not whither the men are gone: pursue quickly after them, for ye can overtake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'>But she had brought them up to the roof, and had hidden them among the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'>And the men pursued after them, by the way to the Jordan unto the fords; and the gate was closed, as soon as those who pursued after them were gone out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'>But they had not yet laid themselves down, when she came up unto them upon the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.9'>And she said unto them, I know that the Lord hath given you the land, and that the terror of you hath fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are become fainthearted, because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'>For we have heard, how that the Lord dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you, when ye went forth out of Egypt; and what ye have done unto the two kings of the Emorites, who were on the other side of the Jordan, unto Sichon and Og, whom ye have utterly destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'>And when we heard this, our heart melted, and there remained not any more courage in any man, because of you; for the Lord your God is alone God in the heavens above, and upon the earth beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'>And now swear, I pray you, unto me by the Lord, because I have shown you kindness, that ye will also, for your part, show kindness, unto my fathers house; and give me a sure token,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'>That ye will preserve the life of my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'>And the men said unto her, Our life shall be doomed to death instead of yours, if ye tell not this our business; and it shall be, when the Lord giveth us the land, that we will show thee kindness and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'>Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was within the town wall, and within the wall she dwelt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'>And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet with you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned; and afterward ye may go your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'>And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thy oath which thou hast caused us to swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'>Behold, when we come into the land, this line of scarlet thread shalt thou bind in the window by which thou hast let us down; and thy father, and thy mother, and thy brothers, and all thy fathers household, thou must bring together unto thee into the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'>And it shall be, that whosoever will go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless; and whosoever will remain with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if a hand be laid upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'>And if thou tell this our business, then will we be free of thy oath which thou hast caused us to swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'>And she said, According unto your words, so be it; and she dismissed them, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'>And they went, and came unto the mountain, and they remained there three days, until the pursuers were returned; and the pursuers sought throughout all the way, but found nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'>And the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and related to him all the things that had befallen them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'>And they said unto Joshua, Truly the Lord hath given up into our hand all the country; for all the inhabitants of the country are already become fainthearted because of us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'>And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they broke up from Shittim, and came close to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'>And it came to pass at the end of three days, that the officers passed through the midst of the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'>And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then shall ye break up from your place, and go after it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'>Nevertheless there shall be a space between you and it, of about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, in order that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'>And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow will the Lord do wonders in the midst of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'>And Joshua said unto the priests, as followeth, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'>And the Lord said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to make thee great in the eyes of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'>And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'>And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Approach hither, and hear the words of the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'>And Joshua said, Hereby shall ye know that the living God is in the midst of you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Emorites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'>And now take yourselves twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, one man each out of every tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'>And it shall come to pass, that as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, namely, the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand up as a wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'>And it came to pass, when the people broke up from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, and the priests the bearers of the ark of the covenant were before the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'>And as they that bore the ark were come up to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the edge of the water, the Jordan, however, had overflowed all its banks all the time of harvest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'>That the waters which came down from above stood still and rose up as a wall, very far from the city Adam, which is beside Zarethan; and those that ran down toward the sea of the plain, the salt sea, failed, were cut off; and the people passed over opposite to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'>And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people had finished passing over the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'>And it came to pass, when all the people had finished passing over the Jordan, That the Lord said unto Joshua, as followeth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'>Take yourselves twelve men out of the people, one man each out of every tribe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'>And command ye them, saying, Take yourselves hence out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests feet stood firmly, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodgingplace, where ye will lodge this night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'>Then did Joshua call the twelve men, whom he had appointed out of the children of Israel, one man each out of every tribe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'>And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take yourselves up every man one stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'>In order that this may be a sign among you, when your children ask in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'>That ye shall answer them, That the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off; and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'>And the children of Israel did so as Joshua had commanded; and they took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as the Lord had spoken unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'>Twelve stones also did Joshua set up in the midst of the Jordan, on the spot where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant had stood: and they have remained there unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'>But the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until every thing was finished that the Lord had commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua; and the people hastened and passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'>And it came to pass, when all the people had finished passing over, that the ark of the Lord passed over with the priests in the presence of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'>And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Menasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken unto them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'>About forty thousand ready armed for war, did they pass over before the Lord unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'>On that day the Lord made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.15'>And the Lord said unto Joshua, as followeth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.16'>Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.17'>And Joshua commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.18'>And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were come up out of the midst of the Jordan, the soles of the feet of the priests were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all its banks, as on the preceding days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.19'>And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the extreme eastern border of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.20'>And those twelve stones, which they had taken out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.21'>And he said unto the children of Israel, thus, When your children shall ask in time to come their fathers, saying, What mean these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.22'>Then shall ye let your children know, saying, On dry land did Israel pass over this Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.23'>That the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.24'>In order that all the nations of the earth may know the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty; in order that ye may fear the Lord your God all the days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'>And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Emorites, who were on the side of the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until they were passed over, that their heart melted, and there remained no more any courage in them, because of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'>At that time the Lord said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.3'>And Joshua made himself sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of Araloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.4'>And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, the males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness on the way, after their going forth out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.5'>For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness on the way at their going forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.6'>For during forty years the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness, till there was an end of all the people, the men of war, who were come out of Egypt, who had not obeyed the voice of the Lord; unto whom the Lord had sworn that he would not let them see the land, which the Lord had sworn unto their fathers that he would give unto us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.7'>But their children he raised up in their stead: these did Joshua circumcise; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.8'>And it came to pass, when the whole people had all been circumcised, that they abode in their places in the camp till they were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.9'>And the Lord said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. And he called the name of the place Gilgal unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.10'>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and they prepared the passoveroffering on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.11'>And they ate of the corn of the land on the morrow after the passoveroffering, unleavened cakes and parched corn, on the selfsame day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.12'>And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the corn of the land; and the children of Israel had not any more manna; but they did eat of the product of the land of Canaan during that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.13'>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, a man was standing over against him with his sword drawn in his hand; and Joshua went unto him, and said to him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.14'>And he said, No; for I am a captain of the host of the Lord: now am I come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed himself, and said to him, What doth my lord speak unto his servant?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.15'>And the captain of the Lords host said unto Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.1'>Now Jericho was shut up, and barred up, because of the children of Israel: no one went out, and no one came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.2'>And the Lord said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho and its king, even the mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.3'>And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.4'>And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven cornets of rams horns; and on the seventh day shall ye compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the cornets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.5'>And it shall come to pass, that, when they blow a long blast with the rams horn, when ye hear the sound of the cornet all the people shall utter a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.6'>And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven cornets of rams horns before the ark of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.7'>And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.8'>And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests, bearing the seven cornets of rams horns before the Lord, passed on and blew with the cornets; and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.9'>And the armed men went before the priests that blew the cornets, and the rereward came after the ark, going on, and blowing with the cornets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.10'>And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you, Shout; and then shall ye shout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.11'>So the ark of the Lord compassed the city, going round it once; and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.12'>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.13'>And the seven priests bearing the seven cornets of rams horns before the ark of the Lord went on continually, and blew with the cornets; and the armed men went before them; and the rereward came after the ark of the Lord, going on, and blowing with the cornets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.14'>And they compassed the city on the second day once, and returned into the camp: so did they six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.15'>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after this manner seven times; only on that day they compassed the city seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.16'>And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priest blew with the cornets, that Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the Lord hath given you the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.17'>And the city shall be devoted, it, and all that is therein, to the Lord: only Rachab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house; because she did hide the messengers that we sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.18'>But ye, keep yourselves from the devoted things, lest ye devote and yet take of the devoted things, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.19'>And all the silver, and gold, and vessels of copper and iron, shall be holy unto the Lord: into the treasury of the Lord shall they come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.20'>So the people shouted, when they blew with the cornets; and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the cornet, that the people uttered a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, and the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.21'>And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and lamb, and ass, with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.22'>But unto the two men that had spied out the country, Joshua said, Go into the house of the woman, the harlot, and bring out thence the woman, and all belonging to her, as ye have sworn unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.23'>And the young men, the spies, went in, and brought out Rachab, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all belonging to her: and they brought out all her kindred, and they left them without the camp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.24'>And the city they burnt with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of copper and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.25'>And Rachab the harlot did Joshua save alive, and her fathers household, and all belonging to her; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel even unto this day; because she had hidden the messengers, whom Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.26'>And Joshua adjured the people at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the Lord, that will rise up and build this city Jericho: with his firstborn shall he lay its foundation, and with his youngest shall he set up its gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.27'>And the Lord was with Joshua; and his fame was spread throughout all the country.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.1'>But the children of Israel committed a trespass on the devoted things; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerach, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted things: and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.2'>And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel, and said unto them, thus, Go up and spy out the country. And the men went up and spied out Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.3'>And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai: do not fatigue all the people to go thither; for they are but few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.4'>So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men; and they fled before the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.5'>And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them from before the gate unto the stonequarries, and smote them on the declivity of the hill; wherefore the heart of the people melted, and became as water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.6'>And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell upon his face to the earth before the ark of the Lord until the evening, he with the elders of Israel, and they put dust upon their head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.7'>And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Eternal, wherefore hast thou caused this people to pass over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Emorites, to destroy us? and oh! that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.8'>I pray thee, O Lord, what shall I say, since Israel have turned their back before their enemies!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.9'>And when the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, they will environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth; and what wilt thou do for thy great name?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.10'>And the Lord said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou upon thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.11'>Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I have commanded them; and they have also taken of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and have also dissembled, and they have also put it into their own vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.12'>Therefore will the children of Israel not be able to stand up before their enemies; their back will they turn before their enemies, because they have become accursed: I will not be any more with you, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.13'>Rise up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow; for thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, An accursed thing is in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou shalt not be able to stand up before thy enemies, until ye have removed the accursed from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.14'>And ye shall be brought near in the morning according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the Lord will seize shall come near according to its families; and the family which the Lord will seize shall come near by households; and the household which the Lord shall seize will come near by its men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.15'>And it shall be, that he that is seized with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he, and all that he hath; because he hath transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and because he hath wrought wickedness in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.16'>So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was seized;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.17'>And he brought near the family of Judah, and he seized the family of the Zarchites; and he brought near the family of the Zarchites by its men, and Zabdi was seized;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.18'>And he brought near his household by its men, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerach, of the tribe of Judah, was seized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.19'>And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me, I pray thee, what thou hast done: hide nothing from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.20'>And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Truly! I have indeed sinned against the Lord the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.21'>I saw among the spoil a handsome Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels in weight, and I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, with the silver beneath the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.22'>Joshua thereupon sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hidden in his tent, and the silver beneath it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.23'>And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and they laid them out before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.24'>And Joshua took Achan the son of Zerach, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his ox, and his ass, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had, and all Israel were with him, and they brought them up unto the valley of Achor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.25'>And Joshua said, How hast thou troubled us! so shall the Lord trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burnt them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.26'>And they raised over him a great heap of stones which is unto this day; and the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.8'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.1'>And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou discouraged: take with thee all the people of war, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.2'>And thou shalt do to Ai and to its king as thou hast done unto Jericho and its king; only its spoil and its cattle shall ye take for booty unto yourselves; but lay thee an ambush for the city in its rear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.3'>So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.4'>And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, in the rear of the city; go not very far from the city; and be ye all ready;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.5'>And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city; and it shall come to pass that, when they come out against us, as at the first time, we will flee before them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.6'>And they will come out after us, till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee from us as at the first time: and we will flee before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.7'>And then shall ye rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city; and the Lord your God will deliver it in into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.8'>And it shall be, that as soon as ye have seized the city, ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of the Lord shall ye do: see, I have commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.9'>And Joshua sent them off: and they went to lie in ambush, and remained between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua lodged that night among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.10'>And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people, toward Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.11'>And all the people of war that were with him went up, and drew nigh, and came opposite the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai; and the valley was between them and Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.12'>And he took about five thousand men, and set them as an ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.13'>And the people, all the camp that was on the north of the city, and its ambush on the west of the city got ready; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.14'>And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw this, the men of the city hastened and rose up early, and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the plain; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him in the rear of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.15'>And Joshua and Israel feigned themselves beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.16'>And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them; and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.17'>And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.18'>And the Lord said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for into thy hand will I give it. And Joshua stretched out the spear which was in his hand toward the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.19'>And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city, and took possession of it, and hastened and set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.20'>And the men of Ai turned and looked behind them, and they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven; and they had no power to flee this way or that way; and the people that had fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.21'>For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had seized the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended: they turned back, and smote the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.22'>And the others issued out of the city against them; so that the Israelites had them in the middle, some on this side, and some on that side; and they smote them, until there was not left of them one that remained or escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.23'>And the king of Ai they caught alive, and brought him to Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.24'>And it came to pass, that, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they had pursued them, and when they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, All the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.25'>And the number of all that fell in that day, both of men and women, was twelve thousand, all the people of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.26'>And Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he had stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.27'>Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty unto themselves, according to the word of the Lord which he had commanded Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.28'>And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a ruinous heap of desolation for ever, even unto this day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.29'>And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide; and at the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took his carcass down from the tree and cast it at the entrance of the city gate, and they raised over him a great heap of stones, which is even unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.30'>Then did Joshua build an altar unto the Lord, the God of Israel on mount Ebal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.31'>As Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no one had lifted up any iron tool; and they offered thereon burntofferings unto the Lord, and sacrificed peaceofferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.32'>And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.33'>And all Israel, and their elders, and the officers, and their judges, stood on this side and on that side of the ark, opposite the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, the stranger no less than the native born: half of them turned toward mount Gerizzim, and the other half of them turned toward mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded, to bless the people of Israel at first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.34'>And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, all, just as it is written in the book of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.35'>There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded, which Joshua did not read before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the stranger that walked in the midst of them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.23.16'>When ye transgress the covenant of the Lord your God, which he hath commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow yourselves down to them: then will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.</verse>
