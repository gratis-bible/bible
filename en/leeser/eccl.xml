      <chapter osisID='Eccl.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.1'>The words of Koheleth, the son of David, the king in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.2'>Vanity of vanities, saith Koheleth, vanity of vanities: all is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.3'>What profit hath a man of all his toil which he toileth under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.4'>One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; but the earth endureth for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.5'>The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth down, and striving to reach his place he riseth again there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.6'>Going toward the south, and turning round toward the north, the wind moveth round about continually; and around its circles doth the wind return again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.7'>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is never full: unto the place whither the rivers go, thither will they continue to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.8'>All things weary themselves constantly; man can not utter them: the eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.9'>That which hath been, is the same which will be; and that which hath been done, is the same which will be done; and there is nothing new under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.10'>If there be any thing whereof it is said, See, this is new: It hath already been in olden times which were before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.11'>Only there is no recollection of former generations; and also of the later ones, that are to beof these likewise there will be no recollection with those that will be still later.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.12'>I Koheleth was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.13'>And I directed my heart to inquire and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the heavens: this is an evil employment which God hath given to the sons of man to busy themselves therewith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.14'>I saw all the deeds that are done under the sun: and, behold, all is vanity and a torture of the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.15'>What is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is defective cannot be numbered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.16'>I spoke with my own heart, saying, Lo, I have truly obtained greater and more wisdom than all those who have been before me over Jerusalem: yea, my heart had seen much wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.17'>And I directed my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly; but I have perceived that this also is a torture of the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.18'>For where there is much wisdom there is much vexation: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth pain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.1'>Come, then, I said in my heart, I will have a taste of joy, and thou shalt see what is good; but, behold, this also was vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.2'>Of laughter I said, It maketh one mad: and of joy, What doth this do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.3'>I resolved in my heart to indulge my body with wine, while my heart guideth itself with wisdom; and to lay fast hold on folly, till I might see what it is that is good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heavens during the number of the days of their life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.4'>I made great works: I built myself houses; I planted myself vineyards;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.5'>I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted therein trees of all kinds of fruit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.6'>I made myself pools of water, to water therewith the forest overgrown with trees;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.7'>I bought menservants and maidservants, and I had likewise those born in my house; I had also great possessions of cattle and flocks above all that had been before me in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.8'>I gathered unto myself also silver and gold, and the choice treasures of kings and of the provinces: I procured myself male singers and female singers, and the delights of the sons of men, wagons and chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.9'>So was I great, and obtained more than all that had been before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.10'>And whatsoever my eyes desired I refused them not; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart was rejoiced with all my toil, and this was my portion of all my toil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.11'>But when I turned myself to look on all my works that my hands had wrought, and on the toil that I had toiled to accomplish: then, behold, all was vanity and a torture of the spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.12'>And then I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly; for what can the man do that cometh after the king? only that which others have done already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.13'>But I saw indeed that wisdom hath the advantage over folly, as great as the advantage of light over darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.14'>The wise man hath his eyes in his head, while the fool walketh in darkness; but I myself perceived then also that one occurrence will befall all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.15'>Then said I in my heart, The same that befalleth the fool will also befall even me: and why have I then been wiser? Then spoke I in my heart, that this is also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.16'>For there is no recollection of the wise any more than of the fool for ever: seeing that which hath long ago been will, in the days that are coming, all be forgotten. And how doth the wise die equally with the fool!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.17'>Therefore I hated life; because I felt displeased with the work that is wrought under the sun; for all is vanity and a torture of the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.18'>Yea, I hated also all my toil with which I had toiled under the sun; because I should have to leave it unto the man that will be after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.19'>And who knoweth, whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have full sway over all my toil wherein I have toiled, and wherein I have shown myself wise under the sun. Also this is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.20'>Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to give up thinking of all the toil wherewith I had toiled under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.21'>For there is many a man whose toil is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and with energy; yet to a man that hath not toiled therefore must he give it as his portion. Also this is vanity and a great evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.22'>For what doth a man obtain of all his toil, and of the torture of his heart, wherewith he toileth under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.23'>For all his days are full of pains, and vexation is mingled with his employment: yea, even in the night his heart taketh not rest. Also this is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.24'>It is not a good thing inherent in man that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy happiness for his toil. Also this have I seen, that it cometh out of the hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.25'>For who can well eat, or who can enjoy earthly things more than I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.26'>For to a man who is good in his presence God giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth employment, to gather up and to bring together, that he may give it to him that is good before God. Also this is vanity and a torture of the spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.1'>For every thing there is a season; and a proper time is for every pursuit under the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.2'>There is a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what hath been planted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.3'>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.4'>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.5'>A time to throw away stones, and a time to gather up stones; a time to embrace, and a time to be far from embracing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.6'>A time to seek, and a time to let things be lost; a time to keep, and a time to throw away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.7'>A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.8'>A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.9'>What profit hath now he that worketh in that wherein he toileth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.10'>I have seen the employment, which God hath given to the sons of men to busy themselves therewith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.11'>Every thing hath he made beautiful in its proper time: he hath also placed the eternity in their heart, without a mans being able to find out the work that God hath made from the beginning to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.12'>I know that there is nothing good inherent in them, but for every one to rejoice and to do what is good during all his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.13'>For also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy what is good for all his toil, is likewise a gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.14'>I know that whatsoever God doth, that will be for ever; to it nothing can be added, and from it there is nothing to be diminished: and God hath so made it, that men should be afraid of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.15'>That which hath been hath long since appeared again; and what is to be hath already been; and God seeketh again that which is sped away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.16'>And moreover I have seen under the sun, that in the place of justice, even there was wickedness; and that in the place of righteousness, even there was wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.17'>I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time for every pursuit; and on account of every deed there will he judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.18'>I said in my heart concerning the speaking of the sons of men, that God might make it clear to them, and that they might see that they by themselves are but beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.19'>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even the same thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one kind of spirit: so that the preeminence of man above the beast is nought; for all is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.20'>Every thing goeth unto one place: every thing came from the dust, and every thing returneth to the dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.21'>Who knoweth the spirit of the sons of man that ascendeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that descendeth downward to the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.22'>And so did I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion; for who can bring him to look with pleasure on what will be after him?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.1'>And I turned about, and beheld all the oppressed that are made so under the sun: and, behold, there are the tears of the oppressed, and they have no comforter; and from the hand of their oppressors they suffer violence; and they have no comforter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.2'>Thereupon praised I the dead that are already dead, more than the living who are still alive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.3'>And as happier than both of them, him who hath not yet come into being, who hath not seen the evildoing that is done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.4'>Again, I beheld all the toil, and all the energy in doing, that it is from the envy of one man of his neighbor. Also this is vanity and a torture of the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.5'>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.6'>Better is a handful of quiet, than both the hands full of toil and torture of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.7'>Then I turned about, and I saw a vanity under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.8'>There is one alone, and he hath not a companion; yea, he hath neither son nor brother: yet is there no end to all his toil; his eye also is not satisfied with riches. Yet for whom do I toil, and deprive my soul of good? Also this is vanity, yea, it is a bad employment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.9'>Two are better than one; because they will have a good reward for their toil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.10'>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to the single one that falleth; for he hath no companion to lift him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.11'>Also, if two lie together, then will they become warm; but how can one person alone become warm?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.12'>And if a man could overpower him, the single one, two would stand up against him: and a threefold cord cannot quickly be torn asunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.13'>Better is a poor and a wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to be admonished any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.14'>For out of the prison cometh the one to reign: whereas also in his kingdom the other becometh poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.15'>I have seen all the living who walk under the sun, being with the second child that is to stand up in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.16'>There was no end to all the people, belonging to all that have been before them: they also that come after will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a torture of the spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.1'>
          <note>(4:17)</note> Watch thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be near to hearken to his will, more than to give the sacrifice of fools; for they consider not that they do evil to themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.2'>
          <note>(5:1)</note> Suffer not thy mouth to be rash, and let thy heart not be hasty to utter any word before God; for God is in the heavens, and thou art upon the earth: therefore let thy words be few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.3'>
          <note>(5:2)</note> For a dream cometh through being much employed with something, and the voice of a fool cometh with a multitude of words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.4'>
          <note>(5:3)</note> When thou makest a vow unto God, do not delay to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in such fools: that which thou hast vowed must thou pay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.5'>
          <note>(5:4)</note> It is better that thou shouldst not vow, than that thou shouldst vow and not pay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.6'>
          <note>(5:5)</note> Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy body to sin; and say thou not before the messenger, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry because of thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.7'>
          <note>(5:6)</note> For in the multitude of dreams and vanities there are also many words; but rather fear thou God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.8'>
          <note>(5:7)</note> If thou see the oppression of the poor, and violence done to justice and righteousness in a province, do not feel astounded at the matter; for one that is high watcheth over the high; and over them, the highest Power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.9'>
          <note>(5:8)</note> But the advantage of a land in all things is, a king who is subject to the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.10'>
          <note>(5:9)</note> He that loveth money will never be satisfied with money; nor he that loveth abundance, with any increase. Also this is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.11'>
          <note>(5:10)</note> When prosperity increaseth, those that consume it likewise increase: and what advantage is there to its owner, saving to see it with his eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.12'>
          <note>(5:11)</note> Sweet is the sleep of the laboring man, whether he eat little or much; but the overabundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.13'>
          <note>(5:12)</note> There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches reserved for their owner to his own hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.14'>
          <note>(5:13)</note> And these riches are lost through an unfortunate event; and he begetteth a son, and hath not the least in his hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.15'>
          <note>(5:14)</note> As he came forth out of his mothers womb, naked will he return to go as he came; and not the least will he carry off for his toil, which he might take away with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.16'>
          <note>(5:15)</note> And also this is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so must he go: and what profit hath he that hath toiled for the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.17'>
          <note>(5:16)</note> All his days also had he to eat in darkness, and hath had much vexation and wrath with his sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.18'>
          <note>(5:17)</note> Behold, what I have truly seen as a good thing, that it is fitting to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all ones toil that he taketh under the sun the number of the days of his life, which God hath given him; for this is his portion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.19'>
          <note>(5:18)</note> Also every man to whom God hath given riches and property, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his toil this is the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.20'>
          <note>(5:19)</note> Let him then remember, that the days of his life are not many, that God hath answered him with the joy of his heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.1'>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is great on men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.2'>There is many a man to whom God hath given riches, property, and honor, and nothing is wanting for his soul of all that he longeth for: yet God empowereth him not to eat thereof, but a stranger will consume it. This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.3'>If a man were to beget a hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years were many, and his soul were not satisfied with what is good, and he have not had even a burial: then do I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.4'>For in vanity it came, and in darkness it departeth, and with darkness will its name be covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.5'>Moreover it never saw the sun, and knew nothing: this hath more rest than the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.6'>Yea, though he were to live a thousand years twice told, and had not seen any good doth not every one go to one place?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.7'>All the toil of a man is for his mouth; and yet is his desire never filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.8'>For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk properly before the living?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.9'>Better is what one seeth with the eyes than the wandering of the desire. Also this is vanity and a torture of the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.10'>That which hath been is already called by its name, and it is known that he is a man: and he is not able to contend with him that is mightier than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.11'>For there are many things that increase vanity: what advantage cometh thence for man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.12'>For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, the number of the days of his vain life, that he should spend them as a shadow? for who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Eccl.7'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.1'>A good name is better than precious oil, and the day of death, better than the day of ones birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.2'>It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting; inasmuch as that is the end of all men: and let the living lay it to his heart.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.7'>For exercising oppression maketh a wise man mad; and bribery corrupteth the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.8'>Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: better is the patient in spirit than the proud in spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.9'>Be not rash in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in bosom of fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.10'>Thou must not say, How was it that the former days were better than these? for it is not out of wisdom that thou askest concerning this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.11'>Wisdom is better than an inheritance, yea, preferable for those that see the sun;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.12'>For under the shadow of wisdom a man is equally well as under the shadow of money; but the superior excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to him that possesseth it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.13'>Consider then the work of God; for who can make straight what he hath made crooked?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.14'>On the day of prosperity be happy, but on the day of adversity look on: also this hath God made in equal measure with the other, to the end that man should not find the least to censure him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.15'>All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is many a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is many a wicked man that liveth long in his wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.16'>Be not righteous over much; neither show thyself over wise: why wouldst thou destroy thyself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.17'>Be not wicked over much, and be no fool: why wouldst thou die before thy time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.18'>It is good that thou shouldst take hold of that, and that also from this thou withdraw not thy hand; for he that feareth God will come forth out of them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.19'>Wisdom giveth more strength to the wise than ten rulers which were in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.20'>For no man is so righteous upon earth, that he should do always good, and never sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.21'>Also take no heed unto all the words that are spoken: lest thou hear thy servant cursing thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.22'>For oftentimes also doth thy own heart know that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.23'>All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.24'>Far is what formerly was so, and what was deep remaineth deep: who can find it out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.25'>Then I turned myself about together with my heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and experience, and to know the wickedness of folly, and the foolishness of madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.26'>And I find as more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are bonds: he that is deemed good before God will escape from her; but the sinner will be caught by her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.27'>Behold, this have I found, saith Koheleth, adding one to the other, to find experience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.28'>What my soul constantly sought, but I found it not; one man among a thousand did I find; but a woman among all these did I not find.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.29'>Lo, this only did I find, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought for many sinful devices.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Eccl.8'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.1'>Who is like the wise? and who knoweth as well the explanation of a thing? a mans wisdom enlighteneth his face, and the boldness of his face will be lessened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.2'>I counsel thee, Keep the kings command, and that which regardeth the oath to him taken by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.3'>Be not hasty to go out of his presence; engage not in an evil thing; for whatsoever pleaseth him, can he do;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.4'>Because the word of a king is powerful; and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.5'>Whoso keepeth the commandment will experience no evil thing: and a wise mans heart knoweth both time and the just consequence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.6'>Because for every pursuit there is a time and a just consequence; for the evil of man resteth heavily upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.7'>For he knoweth not that which will be; for who can tell him how it will be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.8'>No man hath control over the spirit to detain the spirit; and there is no control over the day of death; and there is no representation in that war; and wickedness will not deliver those that practise it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.9'>All this have I seen, and directed my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time when one man ruleth over another to his own injury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.10'>Then also did I see the wicked buried, who had gone to their rest; but those who had acted correctly had to go away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city. Also this is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.11'>Because the punishment against evil deeds is not executed speedily, therefore is the heart of the sons of men filled up in them to do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.12'>But let a sinner do evil a hundred times, and God withhold long his punishment from him; still do I truly know for certain that it will be well with those that fear God, because they are afraid of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.13'>And that it will not be well with the wicked, and that he will not endure many days, like the shadow; because he is not afraid of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.14'>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there are righteous men, unto whom it happeneth in accordance with the deeds of the wicked; again, there are wicked men, to whom it happeneth in accordance with the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.15'>Therefore do I praise joyfulness, that there is nothing better for man under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful; for this will adhere to him in his toil, during the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.16'>When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the employment that is done upon the earth, how even neither by day nor by night sleep is seen in the eyes of some men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.17'>Then did I see in the whole work of God, that a man is not able to find out the work that is done under the sun; inasmuch as though a man were to toil to seek for it, he would yet not find it; and even if the wise were to think to know it, he would yet not be able to find it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.9'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.1'>For all this did I reflect over in my heart and to explain all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their services, are in the hand of God: that man knoweth neither love nor hatred; it is all ordained before them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.2'>Every thing as it is to happen to all; there is but one occurrence for the righteous, and for the wicked; for the good and for the clean, and for the unclean; and for him that sacrificeth, and for him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner; he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.3'>This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one occurrence for all, and that also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and that madness is in their heart while they live, and after this they go to the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.4'>For whoever is yet united with all the living hath still hope; for a living dog fareth better than a dead lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.5'>For the living know that they will die; but the dead know not the least; nor have they longer any reward; for their memory is forgotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.6'>Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, are now already lost; and they will have never more a portion in all that is done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.7'>Go, eat with joy thy bread, and drink with a merry heart thy wine, if God have already received thy works in favor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.8'>At all times let thy garments be white, and let oil not be wanting on thy head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.9'>Enjoy life with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which God hath given thee under the sun, yea, all the days of thy vanity; for this is thy portion in this life, and in thy toil with which thou toilest under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.10'>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do with thy might, that do; for there is no work, nor experience, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the nether world, whither thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.11'>I turned about, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the mighty; and that also the wise have no bread, nor yet the men of understanding riches, nor yet men of knowledge favor; but time and fate will overtake them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.12'>For man also knoweth not his time, like the fishes that are caught in an evil net, and like the birds that are caught in the snare: like these are the sons of men ensnared at an evil time, when it falleth upon them suddenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.13'>Also in this manner have I seen wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.14'>There was a little city, and the men therein were few; and there came against it a great king, who enclosed it, and built around it great works of siege;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.15'>But there was found in it a poor wise man, and he delivered the city by his wisdom; yet no man had thought of that same poor man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.16'>Then said I, Wisdom is better than might: although the poor mans wisdom is held in contempt, and his words are not heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.17'>The words of wise men heard in quiet are better than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.18'>Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner causes much good to be lost.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.10'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.1'>Dead flies cause the precious oil of the apothecary to become stinking and foaming; so doth a little folly him that is valued for wisdom and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.2'>The heart of a wise man is at his right hand; but the heart of a fool is at his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.3'>Yea also, on whatever way the fool walketh, doth he lack proper sense, and he saith to all that he is a fool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.4'>If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for submissiveness causeth great offences to be avoided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.5'>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, like an error which proceedeth from the ruler:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.6'>Folly is set in great high places, and the rich sit in lowness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.7'>I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.8'>He that diggeth a pit will fall into it; and him who breaketh down a fencea serpent will bite him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.9'>Whoso removeth stones will be hurt through them; and he that cleaveth wood will be endangered thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.10'>If the iron be blunt, and man do not whet the edge, then must he exert more strength; but the advantage of making it properly sharp is wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.11'>If the serpent do bite because no one uttered a charm, then hath the man that can use his tongue in charming no preference.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.12'>The words of a wise mans mouth bring grace; but the lips of a fool will destroy himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.13'>The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the last that cometh out of his mouth is evilbringing madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.14'>The fool also multiplieth words; but a man cannot know what is to be; and what is to be after him, who can tell him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.15'>The toil of the foolish will weary every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.16'>Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is lowminded, and when thy princes eat in the morning!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.17'>Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is noblespirited, and thy princes eat in proper time, for strengthening, and not for gluttony!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.18'>Through slothful hands the rafters will sink; and through idleness of the hands the house will become leaky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.19'>For gay pleasure they prepare a feast, and wine is to make the living joyful; but money procureth all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.20'>Even in thy thought thou must not curse a king; and in thy bedchambers do not curse the rich; for a bird of the air can carry the sound, and that which hath wings can tell the word.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.1'>Cast thy bread upon the face of the waters; for after many days wilt thou find it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.2'>Give a portion to seven, and also to eight: for thou knowest not what evil may come upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.3'>If the clouds be full of rain, they will empty it out upon the earth; and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, on the place where the tree falleth, there will it remain.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.5'>As thou knowest not which is the way of the wind, as little as what is enclosed in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou canst not know the works of God who maketh all.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.10'>And remove vexation from thy heart, and cause evil to pass away from thy body; for childhood and the time when the head is black are vanity.</verse>
