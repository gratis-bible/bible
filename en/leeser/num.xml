        <verse osisID='Num.27.18'>And the Lord said unto Moses, Take to thyself Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom there is a spirit, and thou shalt lay thy hand upon him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.27.19'>And thou shalt cause him to stand before Elazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and thou shalt give him a charge before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.27.20'>And thou shalt put some of thy greatness upon him; in order that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.27.21'>And before Elazar the priest shall he stand, and he shall ask of him after the judgment of the Urim before the Lord: at his direction shall they go out, and at his direction shall they come in, he, and all the children of Israel with him, and all the congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.27.22'>And Moses did, as the Lord had commanded him; and he took Joshua, and caused him to stand before Elazar the priest, and before all the congregation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.27.23'>And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge: as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses.</verse>
