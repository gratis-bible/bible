        <verse osisID='Amos.1.1'>The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he foresaw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziyah the king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash the king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.2'>And he said, The Lord will cry aloud out of Zion, and from Jerusalem will he send forth his voice; and then shall mourn the pastures of the shepherds, and then shall dry up the top of Carmel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.1.9'>Thus hath said the Lord, For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, will I not turn away their punishment; because they delivered up the exiles in full numbers to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.3.2'>Only you have I loved out of all the families of the earth: therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.3'>Will two walk together, except they had agreed to do so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.4'>Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion send forth his voice out of his den, unless he have caught something?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.5'>Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, when there is no gin for him? is ever a snare taken up from the ground, when it hath caught nothing at all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.6'>Shall a cornet be blown in a city, and the people not become afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord have not done it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.7'>For the Lord Eternal will do nothing, unless he have revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.8'>The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord Eternal hath spoken, who will not prophesy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.9'>Publish at the palaces in Ashdod, and at the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great confusions in her midst, and the oppressions that are within her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.3.12'>Thus hath said the Lord, As the shepherd snatcheth out of the mouth of the lion at most two legbones, or a tip of the ear: so shall be delivered the children of Israel that sit in Samaria on the corner of a bed, and on Damascus couches.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Amos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.1'>Hear this word, O ye cows of Bashan, that are on the mount of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who say to their lords, Bring, and let us drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.2'>Sworn hath the Lord Eternal by his holiness, that, lo, days are coming over you, when men will carry you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.3'>And through breaches in the wall shall ye go out, every one through that before her: and ye shall cast off your proud greatness, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.4'>Go then to Bethel, and transgress; to Gilgal, and multiply transgression; and bring in the morning your sacrifices, after three days your tithes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.5'>And burn of leaven a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and proclaim and publish freewillofferings; for so do you love to do, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord Eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.6'>But, I also had indeed given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: and yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.7'>And I also had indeed withholden from you the rain, when it was yet three months to the harvest; and I caused it to rain upon one city, and upon another city I caused it not to rain; one piece of land was rained upon, and another piece whereupon it rained not became dried up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.8'>And two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: and yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.4.12'>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: because then I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.13'>For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morningdawn and darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The Lord, the God of hosts, is his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.1'>Hear ye this word which I take up against you, as a lamentation, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.2'>She is fallen, she will not rise againthe virgin of Israel: she is thrown down upon her land; there is none to raise her up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.3'>For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, The city that goeth forth with a thousand shall retain but a hundred, and she that goeth forth with a hundred shall retain but ten, left to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.4'>For thus hath said the Lord unto the house of Israel, Seek ye for me, and ye shall live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.5'>But seek not for Bethel, and into Gilgal enter not, and to Beersheba do not pass over; for Gilgal shall surely go into exile, and Bethel shall become naught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.6'>Seek for the Lord, and ye shall live: so that he come not suddenly like fire over the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Bethel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.7'>Ye who change justice into wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.8'>But he maketh the seven stars and Orion, and changeth into morning the shadow of death, and maketh the day dark into night; he it is that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out over the face of the earth: The Lord is his name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.9'>That causeth wasting to prevail against the strong, so that wasting shall come against the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.10'>They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and him that speaketh uprightly they abhor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.11'>Therefore forasmuch as you tread down upon the poor, and ye take from him onerous contributions of corn: if ye have built houses of hewn stone, ye shall not dwell in them; if ye have planted pleasant vineyards, ye shall not drink their wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.12'>For I know your manifold transgressions and your numerous sins: ye are those that are the adversaries of the just, that take a ransom, and that wrest the cause of the needy in the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.13'>Therefore will the intelligent keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.14'>Seek for the good, and not the evil, in order that ye may live: and so will the Lord, the God of hosts, be with you, as ye have said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.15'>Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice firmly in the gate: perhaps the Lord the God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.16'>Therefore thus hath said the Eternal, the God of hosts, the Lord, On all public places there is lamentation, and in all the streets they cry, Woe! woe! and they call the husbandman to mourning, and to lamentation those skilled in wailing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.17'>And in all vineyards there is lamentation; for I will pass through thy midst, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.18'>Woe unto you that long for the day of the Lord! for what do you wish the day of the Lord? it is one of darkness, and not of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.19'>As if a man were to flee from a lion, and a bear should meet him; and he enter into the house, and lean his hand against the wall, and a serpent should bite him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.20'>Behold the day of the Lord is one of darkness, and not of light; yea, it is obscure, and hath no brightness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.21'>I hate, I despise your feastdays, and I will not smell the sacrifices on your festive assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.22'>For though ye should offer me burntofferings and your meatofferings, I will not accept them in favor: and the peaceofferings of your fatted cattle will I not look at.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.23'>Remove thou from around me the noise of thy songs: and the playing of thy psalteries I will not hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.24'>But let justice roll along like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.25'>Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and meatofferings in the wilderness during forty years, O house of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.26'>Bear then the canopy of your chief idol, and the figure of your images, the star of your god, which ye have made for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.27'>And I will cause you to go into exile far beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, The God of hosts is his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.1'>Woe to those that are free from care in Zion, and that are in safety on the mount of Samaria, who are named the chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.2'>Pass ye over unto Calneh, and see; and go from there to Chamathrabbah; then go down to Gath of the Philistines: whether they be better than these kingdoms? or whether their territory be greater than your territory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.3'>Ye that deem far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.4'>That lie upon beds of ivory, and are stretched out upon their couches, and eat lambs out of the flock, and calves out of the midst of the stall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.5'>That chant to the sound of the psaltery, and like Davids do they imagine their instrument of music to be;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.6'>That drink out of winebowls, and anoint themselves with the costliest of ointments; but who feel no pain for the wound of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.7'>Therefore now shall they go into exile at the head of exiles, and the noisy banquet of those that were stretched out shall pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.8'>The Lord Eternal hath sworn by his own existence, saith the Lord the God of hosts, I abhor the pride of Jacob, and his palaces do I hate: therefore will I surrender up to the enemy the city with all that filleth it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.9'>And it shall come to pass, that if there remain ten men in one house, they shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.10'>And should a mans uncle or relative carry him forth, to bring out the bones out of the house, and say unto him that is in the recesses of the house, Is there yet any one with thee? he will say, There is no one left. Then will he say, Be silent; for we may not make mention of the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.11'>For, behold, the Lord commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.12'>Do horses ever run upon the rock? or will one plough there with oxen? that ye have turned justice into poison, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.13'>Ye who rejoice for a thing of naught, who say, Have we not through our own strength procured ourselves horns?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.14'>For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the Lord the God of hosts, and they shall oppress you from the entrance of Chamath unto the brook of the wilderness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.1'>Thus did the Lord Eternal show unto me: and, behold, he was forming locusts in the beginning of the sprouting up of the latter groweth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the kings mowings was over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.2'>And it came to pass, when they had made an end of eating up the herbs of the earth, that I said, O Lord Eternal, forgive, I beseech thee: how should Jacob be able to endure, since he is so small!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.3'>The Lord bethought himself of this: It shall not be, said the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.4'>Thus did the Lord Eternal show unto me: and, behold, the Lord Eternal called forth the punishment by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and consumed the ploughed field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.5'>Then said I, O Lord Eternal, forbear, I beseech thee: how should Jacob be able to endure, since he is so small!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.6'>The Lord bethought himself of this: Also this shall not be, said the Lord Eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.7'>Thus he showed unto me: and, behold, the Lord was standing upon a wall made by a plumbline, and in his hand was a plumbline.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.8'>And the Lord said unto me, What dost thou see, Amos? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel; I will not farther indulge them any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.9'>And the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid in ruins: and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.10'>Then sent Amazyah, the priest of Bethel, to Jeroboam the king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.11'>For thus hath Amos said, By the sword shall Jeroboam die, and Israel shall surely be led away into exile out of their own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.12'>And Amazyah said unto Amos, Seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and eat there thy bread, and there prophesy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.13'>But at Bethel prophesy not farther any more; for it is the kings sanctuary, and it is a royal residence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.14'>Then answered Amos, and said to Amazyah, I am no prophet, nor am I a prophets son; but I am a herdman, and a gatherer of wild figs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.15'>But the Lord hath taken me away from behind the flocks, and the Lord said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.16'>And now hear thou the word of the Lord, Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and preach not against the house of Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.17'>Therefore thus hath said the Lord, Thy wife will play the harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided out by the line; and thou shalt die in an unclean land; and Israel shall surely be led forth into exile out of their land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.8'>

        <verse osisID='Amos.9.2'>Though they were to creep down into the nether world, thence would my hand fetch them; and though they were to climb up to the heavens, thence would I bring them down;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.3'>And though they were to hide themselves on the top of Carmel, thence would I search and take them out; and though they were to conceal themselves from before my eyes in the bottom of the sea, thence would I command the serpent, that he should bite them;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.9.6'>That buildeth in the heavens his steps, and hath founded his vault over the earth; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out over the face of the earth: The Lord is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.7'>Are ye not like the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the Lord: have I not brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.8'>Behold, the eyes of the Lord Eternal are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; save only that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the Lord.</verse>
