      <chapter osisID='Judg.1'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.1'>And it came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the children of Israel asked the Lord, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites at the first, to fight against them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.2'>And the Lord said, Judah shall go up; behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.3'>And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, and we will fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.4'>And Judah went up; and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they smote of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.5'>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.6'>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.7'>And Adonibezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered food under my table: as I have done, so hath God requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.8'>And the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and captured it, and they smote it with the edge of the sword, and the city they set on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.9'>And afterward did the children of Judah go down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the lowlands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.10'>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron; now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiryatharba;and they smote Sheshai, and Achiman, and Talmai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.11'>And he went from there against the inhabitants of Debir; and the name of Debir was formerly Kiryathsepher:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.12'>And Caleb said, He that will smite Kiryathsepher, and capture it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.13'>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Calebs younger brother, captured it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter for wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.14'>And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she persuaded him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What aileth thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.15'>And she said unto him, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a dry land: give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.16'>And the children of the Kenite, the fatherinlaw of Moses, went up out of the city of palmtrees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is at the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.17'>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they smote the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and devoted it. And the name of the city was called Chormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.18'>And Judah captured Gazzah with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.19'>And the Lord was with Judah; and he took possession of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.1.21'>And the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem, the children of Benjamin did not drive out; but the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.22'>And the house of Joseph, these also, went up against Bethel; and the Lord was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.23'>And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel: now the name of the city formerly was Luz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.24'>And the watchers saw a man coming forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will show thee kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.25'>And he showed them the entrance into the city, and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but the man and all his family they let go free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.26'>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called its name Luz: this is its name unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.27'>Neither did Menasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and its towns, nor Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Yibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites succeeded to remain in this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.28'>And it came to pass, when Israel became strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but they did not drive them out entirely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.29'>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; and the Canaanites dwelt in the midst of them at Gezer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.30'>Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; and the Canaanites dwelt in the midst of them, and became tributary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.31'>Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Akko, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Achlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Chelbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rechob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.32'>And the Asherites dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.33'>Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; and he dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributary unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.34'>And the Emorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain; for they would not suffer them to come down into the valley;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.35'>And the Emorites succeeded to remain on mount Cheres, in Ayalon, and in Shaalbim; but when the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, they became tributary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.36'>And the territory of the Emorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the Rock upward.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.2'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.1'>And a messenger of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim, And he said, I caused you to go up out of Egypt, and I brought you unto the land which I had sworn unto your fathers; and I said, I will not break my covenant with you for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.2'>But ye for your part shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; their altars shall ye throw down; but ye have not obeyed my voice: what is this ye have done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.3'>And I also have said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be evil neighbors to you, and their gods shall become a snare unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.4'>And it came to pass, when the messenger of the Lord spoke these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.5'>And they called the name of that place, Bochim; and they sacrificed there unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.6'>And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to take possession of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.7'>And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that lived many days after Joshua, who had seen all the great deeds of the Lord, which he had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.8'>Then died Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, being one hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.9'>And they buried him on the border of his inheritance in Timnathcheres, in the mountain of Ephraim, on the north side of mount Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.10'>And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers; and there arose another generation after them, who knew not the Lord, and likewise not the deeds which he had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.11'>And the children of Israel did the evil in the eyes of the Lord, and served the Bealim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.12'>And they forsook the Lord the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they went after other gods, of the gods of the nations that were round about them, and they bowed themselves unto them, and incensed the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.13'>And they forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.14'>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of spoilers who spoiled them, and he sold them into the hand of their enemies round about, and they were not able any longer to stand before their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.15'>Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord had spoken, and as the Lord had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.16'>And the Lord raised up judges, and they delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.17'>But also unto their judges they did not hearken; but they went astray after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers had walked in, to obey the commandments of the Lord; they did not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.18'>And when the Lord raised them up judges, then was the Lord with the judge, and he delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the Lord bethought himself because of their groaning by reason of those that oppressed them and illtreated them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.19'>And it came to pass, when the judge died, that they returned, and became more corrupt than their fathers, in going after other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them: they omitted nothing from their doings, and from their stubborn way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.20'>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel; and he said, For the cause that this people have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.21'>So will I also for my part not drive out henceforth any man from before them out of the nations which Joshua left when he died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.22'>In order to prove through them the Israelites, whether they will keep the way of the Lord, to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.23'>And thus did the Lord leave these nations, so as not to drive them out speedily; and he delivered them not into the hand of Joshua.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.3'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.1'>Now these are the nations that the Lord left, to prove by them the Israelites, namely, all those who had not experienced all the wars of Canaan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.2'>Only in order that the future generations of the children of Israel might obtain knowledge, to teach them war; but only such as before had learned nothing thereof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.3'>Namely, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Zidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt on mount Lebanon, from mount Baalchermon unto the entrance of Chamath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.4'>And they were left to prove by them the Israelites, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the Lord, which he had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.5'>And the children of Israel dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Emorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.6'>And they took their daughters to themselves for wives, and their daughters they gave to their sons; and they served their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.7'>And the children of Israel did thus the evil in the eyes of the Lord, and forgot the Lord their God, and served the Bealim and the groves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.8'>Wherefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushanrishathayim the king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushanrishathayim eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.9'>And the children of Israel cried then unto the Lord, and the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, namely, Othniel the son of Kenaz, the younger brother of Caleb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.10'>And the spirit of the Lord came over him, and he judged Israel, and went out to battle: and the Lord delivered Cushanrishathayim the king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed over Cushanrishathayim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.11'>And the land had rest forty years; and then died Othniel the son of Kenaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.12'>And the children of Israel did again the evil in the eyes of the Lord; and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done the evil in the eyes of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.13'>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and they went and smote Israel, and took possession of the city of palmtrees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.14'>And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.15'>But the children of Israel cried then unto the Lord; and the Lord raised up unto them a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera a Benjamite, a man who was lamed in his right hand; and the children of Israel sent by him a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.16'>But Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his garments upon his right thigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.17'>And he brought the present near unto Eglon the king of Moab; now Eglon was a very fat man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.18'>And it came to pass when he had made an end to offer the present, that he sent away the people who had borne the present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.19'>But he himself returned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret word unto thee, O King. And he said, Keep silence. And thereupon went out from his presence all that stood by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.20'>And Ehud came in unto him; and he was sitting in the summer upper chamber, which was for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a word of God unto thee. And he arose out of his chair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.21'>And Ehud stretched forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.22'>And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade; for he did not draw the sword out of his body, and it passed into the fundament.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.23'>And Ehud went forth into the anteroom, and shut the doors of the upper chamber after him, and locked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.24'>He was just gone out, when his servants came; and they saw, behold, the doors of the upper chamber were locked; and they said, Surely he covereth his feet in the summer chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.25'>And they tarried till they were ashamed; and behold, he opened not the doors of the upper chamber; wherefore they took the key and opened them: and, behold, their lord was lying dead on the floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.26'>And Ehud had escaped while they were tarrying, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.27'>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew the cornet on the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mountain, and he before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.28'>And he said unto them, Pursue after me; for the Lord hath delivered your enemies, the Moabites, into your hand. And they went down after him, and seized on the fords of the Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.29'>And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valor; and there escaped not a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.30'>And Moab was humbled that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.31'>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the philistines six hundred men with an oxgoad; and he also delivered Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.4'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.1'>And the children of Israel again did the evil in the eyes of the Lord, when Ehud was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.2'>And the Lord sold them into the hand of Yabin the king of Canaan, that reigned in Chazor; and the captain of his army was Sissera, who dwelt in Charoshethhagoyim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.3'>And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and he oppressed the children of Israel with might twenty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.4'>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth,she judged Israel at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.5'>And she held her sitting under the palmtree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel on the mountain of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.6'>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali; and she said unto him, Behold, the Lord the God of Israel hath commanded, Go and lead on toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.7'>And I will draw unto thee, to the brook Kishon, Sissera, the captain of Yabins army, and his chariots and his multitude; and I will give him up into thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.8'>And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then will I go; but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.9'>And she said, I will indeed go with thee; nevertheless it will not be for thy honor, on the way which thou goest; for into the hand of a woman will the Lord deliver Sissera; and Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.10'>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up in his train ten thousand men; also Deborah went up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.11'>Now Cheber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites, from the children of Chobab the fatherinlaw of Moses; and he had pitched his tent as far as Elonbezaanannim, which is near Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.12'>And they told Sissera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.13'>And Sissera called together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Charoshethhagoyim unto the brook Kishon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.14'>And Deborah said unto Barak, Up! for this is the day on which the Lord hath given Sissera into thy hand; behold, the Lord is gone out before thee: so Barak went down from mount Tabor, with ten thousand men after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.15'>And the Lord confounded Sissera, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sissera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.16'>And Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army, unto Charoshethhagoyim: and all the army of Sissera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not left even one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.17'>But Sissera had fled away on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Cheber the Kenite; for there was peace between Yabin the king of Chazor and the house of Cheber the Kenite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.18'>And Jael went out to meet Sissera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in unto me, fear not: and he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a blanket.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.19'>And he said unto her, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water; for I am thirsty: and she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him to drink, and covered him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.20'>And he said unto her, Stand at the door of the tent; and it shall be, that, when any man should come and ask of thee, and say, Is there any man here? thou shalt say, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.21'>And Jael the wife of Cheber took thereupon the nail of the tent, and placed a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and struck the nail into his temple, and it became fastened in the ground; but he was fast asleep and weary; so he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.22'>And, behold, Barak came in pursuit of Sissera, and Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou art seeking: and he came to her, and behold, Sissera was lying dead, with the nail in his temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.23'>So did God humble on that day Yabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.24'>And the hand of the children of Israel became constantly heavier upon Yabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Yabin the king of Canaan.</verse>
      </chapter>

        <verse osisID='Judg.5.1'>Then sang Deborah with Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.2'>When depravity had broken out in Israel, then did the people offer themselves willingly; therefore praise ye the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.3'>Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes; Iunto the Lord will I sing; I will sing praise to the Lord, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.4'>Lord, at thy going forth out of Seir, at thy marching along out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, also the heavens dropped, also the clouds dropped water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.5'>The mountains melted away because of the presence of the Lord, yonder Sinai, because of the presence of the Lord, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.6'>In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and those who travelled on roads walked through crooked bypaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.7'>Desolate were the open towns in Israel, they were desolate, until that I arose, Deborah, that I arose a mother in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.8'>They chose new gods, then was there war in the gates: was there a shield seen or a spear among forty thousand in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.9'>My heart belongeth to the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people: praise ye the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.10'>Ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and ye who walk on the way, utter praise!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.11'>Urged on by the voice of those who divide the flocks between the watering wells, there shall they rehearse the benefits of the Lord, the benefits toward his open towns in Israel; for now go down again to the gates the people of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.12'>Awake, awake, Deborah! awake, awake, utter a song! up, Barak, and lead away thy captives, son of Abinoam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.13'>Then obtained dominion a few that had escaped for the nobles among the peoplethe Lord gave me dominion over the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.14'>They whose root is out of Ephraim were against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, with thy armies; out of Machir came down lawgivers, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.15'>And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; yea Issachar, the support of Barak; into the valley he hastened down in his train; but at the streams of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.16'>Why didst thou sit among the sheepfolds to hear the bleatings of the flocks? At the streams of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.17'>Gilad abode beyond the Jordan; and Danwhy would he tarry in ships? Asher remained on the seashore, and abode near his bays.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.18'>Zebulun is a people that jeoparded its life unto death, and Naphtalion the high places of the battle field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.19'>There came kings, and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan, in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: gain of money they took not away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.20'>From heaven they foughtthe stars in their courses fought against Sissera.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.21'>The stream of Kishon swept them away, that ancient stream, the stream of Kishon: step along, O my soul, in victorious strength.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.5.26'>Her hand she put forth to the nail, and her right hand to the laborious workmens hammer; and she hammered Sissera, she struck his head, and crushed and smote through his temple.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.6'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.1'>And the children of Israel did the evil in the eyes of the Lord: and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.2'>And the hand of Midian prevailed over Israel; and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made for themselves the passes which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.3'>And it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, and they went up against them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.4'>And they encamped against them, and destroyed the products of the earth, as far as Gazzah, and they left no sustenance for Israel, neither lamb, nor ox, nor ass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.5'>For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and came as locusts in multitude; and both they and their camels were without number; and they came into the land to destroy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.6'>And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.7'>And it came to pass, when the children of Israel had cried unto the Lord because of the Midianites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.8'>That the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, and he said unto them, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, I led you forth out of Egypt, and brought you out of the house of slavery;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.9'>And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and I drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.10'>And I said unto you, I am the Lord your God: ye shall not fear the gods of the Emorites, in whose land ye dwell; but ye have not obeyed my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.11'>And there came an angel of the Lord, and sat down under the oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite; and Gidon his son was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.12'>And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and said unto him, The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.13'>And Gidon said unto him, Pardon, my lord, if the Lord be indeed with us, why then hath all this befallen us? and where are all his wonders of which our fathers have told us, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt! But now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.14'>And the Lord turned toward him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: behold, I have sent thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.15'>And he said unto him, Pardon my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is the weakest in Menasseh, and I am the youngest of my fathers house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.16'>And the Lord said unto him, Because I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.17'>And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy eyes, then give me a sign that thou hast been speaking with me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.18'>Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thy return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.19'>And Gidon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.20'>And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and the broth pour out. And he did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.21'>Then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.22'>And when Gidon perceived that it was an angel of the Lord, Gidon said, Alas, O Lord Eternal! because I have surely seen an angel of the Lord face to face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.23'>And the Lord said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.24'>And Gidon built there an altar unto the Lord, and called it Adonayshalom the Eternal of Peace: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.25'>And it came to pass in the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Take thy fathers young bullock, and the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal which belongeth to thy father, and the grove that is around it shalt thou cut down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.26'>And build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock, on the level place, and take the second bullock, and offer it as a burntsacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.27'>And Gidon took ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord had spoken unto him; but it came to pass, because he feared his fathers household, and the men of the city, to do it by day, that he did it by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.28'>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was overthrown, and the grove that was around it was cut down, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar which had been built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.29'>And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And they inquired and searched, and then said, Gidon the son of Joash hath done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.30'>Thereupon said the men of the city unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die; because he hath overthrown the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was around it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.31'>But Joash said unto all that stood around him, Will ye indeed contend for Baal? will ye assist him? he that will contend for him, shall be put to death; wait until morning: if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one hath overthrown his altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.32'>And the people called him on that day Yerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he hath overthrown his altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.33'>And all the Midianites and Amalekites and the children of the east assembled together, and went over and encamped in the valley of Yizreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.34'>But the Spirit of the Lord endued Gidon, and he blew the cornet: and Abiezer assembled and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.35'>And he sent messengers throughout all Menasseh, who also assembled and followed him; and he sent messengers through Asher, and through Zebulun, and through Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.36'>And Gidon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.37'>Behold, I set up this fleece of wool in the threshing floor: if now there be dew on the fleece alone, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.38'>And it was so; and when he rose up early on the morrow, he squeezed the fleece together, and wrung dew out of the fleece, making a bowl full of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.39'>And Gidon said unto God, Let not thy anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once more; let me have a proof, I pray thee, but this once more with the fleece; let it, I pray, be dry upon the fleece alone, and upon all the ground let there be dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.40'>And God did so that night; and it was dry upon the fleece alone, and on all the ground there was dew.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.7'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.1'>Then Yerubbaal, who is Gidon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Charod; and the camp of the Midianites was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.2'>And the Lord said unto Gidon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand: lest Israel should vaunt themselves against me, saying, my own hand hath saved me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.3'>Now therefore, do proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilad. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and ten thousand remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.4'>And the Lord said unto Gidon, The people are yet too many; let them go down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I will say unto thee, This one shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee: and of whomsoever I will say unto thee, This one shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.5'>So he caused the people to go down unto the water: and the Lord said unto Gidon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as the dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that bendeth down upon his knees to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.6'>And the number of those that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bent down upon their knees to drink water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.7'>And the Lord said unto Gidon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let all the other people go every man unto his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.8'>And they took the provision of the people in their hand, and their cornets; and all the rest of Israel he dismissed, every man unto his tent; but those three hundred men he retained: and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.9'>And it came to pass, during the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Arise, get thee down into the camp; for I have delivered it into thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.10'>And if thou fear to go down, then go thou down with Purah thy servant to the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.11'>And thou shalt hear what they will say; and after that shall thy hands be strengthened, and thou wilt go down unto the camp. And he went down with Purah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.12'>And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like the locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is by the seaside for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.13'>And when Gidon was come, behold, a man was telling a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream, and, lo, a baked cake of barley bread was rolling round through the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and struck against it so that it fell, and it turned it bottom upward, and the tent thus tumbled down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.14'>And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gidon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; into whose hand God hath delivered Midian, and the whole camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.15'>And it was, when Gidon heard the narration of the dream, and its interpretation, that he prostrated himself, and returned unto the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for the Lord hath delivered into your hand the camp of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.16'>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put cornets in the hand of all of them, with empty pitchers, and torches in the pitchers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.17'>And he said unto them, What you see me do, do ye likewise; and, behold, when I am come to the edge of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.18'>When I blow the cornet, I and all that are with me, then shall ye blow the cornets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For the Lord, and for Gidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.19'>And Gidon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the edge of the camp in the bcginning of the middle watch; when they had but newly set the sentinels: and they blew the cornets, and broke the pitchers that were in their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.20'>And the three companies blew the cornets, and broke the pitchers, and seized with their left hand the torches, and with their right hand the cornets to blow; and they cried, The sword for the Lord, and for Gidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.21'>And they remained standing every man in his place round about the camp; and all in the camp ran, and shouted, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.22'>And as the three hundred cornets sounded, the Lord set every mans sword against his fellow, even throughout all the camp; and those in the camp fled as far as Bethhashittah to Zererah, up to the border of Abelmecholah, near Tabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.23'>And the men of Israel were called together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Menasseh, and they pursued after the Midianites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.24'>And Gidon sent messengers throughout all the mountain of Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and seize from them the waters as far as Bethbarah and the Jordan. And all the men of Ephraim assembled themselves, and seized on the waters as far as Bethbarah and the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.25'>And they captured two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued the Midianites; and the heads of Oreb and Zeeb they brought to Gidon from the other side of the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.8'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.1'>And the men of Ephraim said unto him, What is this thing that thou hast done unto us, not to call for us, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they quarrelled with him vehemently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.2'>And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.3'>Into your hand God delivered the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what have I been able to do in comparison with you? Then was their anger abated from him, when he had spoken this speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.4'>And Gidon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, and in pursuit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.5'>And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, a few loaves of bread unto the people that are in my train; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebach and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.6'>And the princes of Succoth said, Is the sole of the foot of Zebach and Zalmunna now already in thy hand, that we should give unto thy army bread?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.7'>And Gidon said, Therefore when the Lord hath delivered Zebach and Zalmunna into my hand, then will I thresh your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.8'>And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke unto them in the same manner: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.9'>And he said also unto the men of Penuel thus, When I return again in peace, I will break down this tower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.10'>Now Zebach and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their camps with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that had been left of all the camp of the children of the east; but those who had fallen were one hundred and twenty thousand men that drew the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.11'>And Gidon went up by the way of those that dwelt in tents, to the east of Nobach and Yogbehah, and smote the camp; but the camp thought itself secure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.12'>And Zebach and Zalmunna fled; but he pursued after them, and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebach and Zalmunna, and all the camp he discomfited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.13'>And Gidon the son of Joash returned from the battle before the rising of the sun,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.14'>And he caught a young man of the people of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he wrote down for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.15'>And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold here are Zebach and Zalmunna, with whom ye derided me, saying, Is the sole of the foot of Zebach and Zalmunna now already in thy hand, that we should give unto thy weary men bread?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.16'>And he took the elders of the city, and the thorns of the wilderness and briers, and chastised with them the men of Succoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.17'>And the tower of Penuel he beat down, and slew the men of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.18'>And he said unto Zebach and Zalmunna, What kind of men were those whom ye slew at Tabor! And they answered, As thou art, so were they; one was in form like that of the children of a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.19'>And he said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother; as the Lord liveth, if ye had spared them alive, I would not slay you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.20'>And he said unto Yether his firstborn, Rise up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword; for he was afraid, because he was yet a youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.21'>Then said Zebach and Zalmunna, Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gidon arose, and slew Zebach and Zalmunna; and he took away the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.22'>And the men of Israel said unto Gidon, Rule thou over us, both thou and thy son, and thy sons son also; for thou hast delivered us out of the hand of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.23'>And Gidon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the Lord shall rule over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.24'>And Gidon said unto them, I would ask one request of you, that ye should give me every man the earring of his booty; for they had had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.25'>And they answered, We will willingly give. And they spread out a garment, and they cast therein every man the earring of his booty.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.12.4'>Then Yiphthach gathered together all the men of Gilad, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilad smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye are fugitives of Ephraim: Gilad is in the midst, between Ephraim and Menasseh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.5'>And the Giladites seized on the passages of the Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it came to pass, when the Ephraimites who had escaped said, Let me pass over; that the men of Gilad said unto him, Art thou an Ephrathite? and if he said, No;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.6'>Then said they unto him, Do say, Shibboleth; but when he said, Sibboleth, and was not able to pronounce it correctly, they laid hold of him and slew him on the passages of the Jordan; and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.13.1'>And the children of Israel did again the evil in the eyes of the Lord; and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.2'>And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoach; and his wife was barren, and did not bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.3'>And there appeared an angel of the Lord unto the woman, and he said unto her, Behold, thou art barren, and hast not born; but thou wilt conceive, and bear a son.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.13.5'>For, lo, thou wilt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head; for a Nazarite of God shall the lad be from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.6'>And the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God, very terrible; but I asked him not whence he might be, and his name he did not tell me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.7'>And he said unto me, Behold, thou wilt conceive, and bear a son; and now thou must drink neither wine nor strong drink, and not eat anything unclean; for the child shall be a Nazarite of God from the womb until the day of his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.8'>And Manoach entreated the Lord, and said, Hear me, O Lord, let the man of God, whom thou didst send, come again unto us, and instruct us what we shall do unto the child that is to be born.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.13.11'>And Manoach arose, and went after his wife; and he came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spokest unto the woman? and he said, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.12'>And Manoach said, If now thy words come to pass, what shall be our proceeding with the child, and what shall be done unto him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.13'>And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoach, Of all that I have said unto the woman must she beware.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.14'>Of any thing that cometh of the grapevine she may not eat, and wine or strong drink she may not drink, and any thing unclean she may not eat: all that I commanded her must she observe.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.13.16'>And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoach, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; but if thou wilt offer a burntoffering, thou must offer it unto the Lord; for Manoach knew not that he was an angel of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.17'>And Manoach said unto the angel of the Lord, What is thy name, that, when thy word cometh to pass, we may do thee honor?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.13.19'>And Manoach took the kid and the meatoffering, and offered it upon the rock unto the Lord: and he did wondrously; and Manoach and his wife looked on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.20'>And it came to pass, when the flame went up from off the altar toward heaven, that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar; and Manoach and his wife looked on, and they fell on their faces to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.21'>And the angel of the Lord was no longer visible to Manoach and to his wife: then knew Manoach that he was an angel of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.22'>And Manoach said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because a divine being have we seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.23'>But his wife said unto him, If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not have received from our hand a burntoffering and a meatoffering, nor would he have let us see all these things, and at this time he would not have let us hear such a thing as this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.24'>And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson; and the child grew up, and the Lord blessed him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.14.1'>And Samson went down to Timnathah, and saw a woman in Timnathah of the daughters of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.2'>And he went up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnathah of the daughters of the Philistines; and now take her to me for wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.3'>Then said unto him his father and his mother, Is there not among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, a woman, that thou art going to take a wife from the Philistines, the uncircumcised? And Samson said unto his father, This one take for me; for she pleaseth me well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.4'>But his father and his mother knew not that it was from the Lord, that he sought but an occasion against the Philistines; and at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.5'>And Samson thus went down, with his father and his mother, to Timnathah; and when they were come as far as the vineyards of Timnathah, behold, a young lion came roaring toward him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.6'>And the Spirit of the Lord came suddenly over him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand; but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.7'>And he went down, and spoke unto the woman; and she pleased Samson well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.8'>And when he returned after a time to take her, he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the carcass of the lion and honey likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.9'>And he took it out in his hands, and went on, eating as he was going, and came to his father and mother, and he gave unto them, and they did eat; but he told them not that out of the carcass of the lion he had taken the honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.10'>And his father went down unto the woman; and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.11'>And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions, and they remained with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.12'>And Samson said unto them, I will now propound unto you a riddle; if ye can in anywise tell it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then will I give you thirty shirts and thirty changes of garments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.13'>But if ye will not be able to tell it to me, then shall ye give me thirty shirts and thirty changes of garments. And they said unto him, Propound thy riddle, that we may hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.14'>And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not solve the riddle in three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.15'>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samsons wife, Persuade thy husband, that he may solve unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy fathers house with fire: have ye invited us to impoverish us? is it not so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.16'>And Samsons wife wept before him, and said, Thou doest but hate me, and lovest me not: that riddle hast thou propounded unto the children of my people, and me hast thou not told the solution. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it to my father and to my mother, and thee shall I tell it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.17'>And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted; and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she had worried him: and she told the solution of the riddle to the children of her people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.18'>Then said unto him the men of the city on the seventh day before the sun was yet gone down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not ploughed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.19'>And the Spirit of the Lord came suddenly over him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew of them thirty men, and he took their apparel, and gave the changes of garments unto the expounders of the riddle; but his anger was kindled, and he went up to his fathers house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.20'>And Samsons wife was given to his companion who had been given him as his associate.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.15'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.1'>And it came to pass after some time, in the time of wheatharvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, Let me go in to my wife into the chamber; but her father would not suffer him to go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.2'>And her father said, I verily thought that thou didst utterly hate her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? Let her be thine, I pray thee, instead of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.3'>And Samson said to them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.4'>And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put one torch between two tails in the midst;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.5'>And he set the torches on fire, and let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both shocks and standing corn, as also oliveyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.6'>Then said the Philistines, Who hath done this! And they answered, Samson, the soninlaw of the Thimnite, because he hath taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines went up, and burnt her and her father with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.7'>And Samson said unto them, Since ye will do the like of this, I will surely be avenged on you, and after that will I cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.8'>And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; and he went down and tarried in the cleft of the rock Etam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.9'>And the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lechi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.10'>And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.11'>Thereupon went three thousand men of Judah down to the cleft of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us? and what is this that thou hast done unto us?

        <verse osisID='Judg.15.12'>And they said unto him, To bind thee are we come down, to deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not assail me yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.13'>And they said unto him, thus, No; for we will only bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand; but we will in nowise kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.14'>When he was come unto Lechi, the Philistines shouted against him; but the Spirit of the Lord came suddenly over him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax threads that are burnt with fire, and his bands melted from off his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.15'>And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and smote therewith a thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.16'>And Samson said, With a jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.17'>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlechi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.18'>And he became very thirsty, and he called on the Lord, and said, Thou hast granted through the hand of thy servant this great deliverance; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.19'>But God clave a hollow place that was at Lechi, and there came forth water out of it; and he drank, and his spirit came again, and he revived; wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lechi unto this day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.16.6'>And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou canst be bound to subdue thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.7'>And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven moist cords which have not yet been dried, then shall I become weak, and be like any other of mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.8'>And the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven moist cords which had not yet been dried, and she bound him with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.9'>And she had men lying in wait, sitting near her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he tore the cords, as a thread of tow is torn when it toucheth the fire; and his strength was not perceived.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.16.13'>And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast deceived me, and told me lies; do tell me wherewith thou canst be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.14'>And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awakened out of his sleep, and tore away the pin of the loom, with the web.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.15'>And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? these three times hast thou deceived me, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.16'>And it came to pass, when she worried him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul became impatient to die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.17'>And he told her all his heart, and said unto her, A razor hath not passed over my head; for a Nazarite of God have I been from my mothers womb; if I were shaved, my strength would depart from me, and I should become weak, and be like all other men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.18'>And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once; for he hath told me all his heart.

        <verse osisID='Judg.21.7'>What shall we do as respecteth wives for those that remain, since we have sworn by the Lord that we will give none of our daughters unto them for wives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.8'>And they said, what one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up unto the Lord to Mizpah? And, behold, there had not come to the camp a man from Yabeshgilad to the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.9'>For the people were numbered, and, behold, there was not present a man of the inhabitants of Yabeshgilad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.10'>And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand persons of the valiant men, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Yabeshgilad with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.11'>And this is the thing that ye shall do, every male, and every woman that hath known man by lying with him, shall ye devote.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.12'>And they found among the inhabitants of Yabeshgilad four hundred young virgins that had not known man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.13'>And the whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin that were on the rock Rimmon, and offered them peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.14'>And Benjamin returned at that time: and they gave unto them the wives whom they had saved alive out of the women of Yabeshgilad; but they found not sufficient for them in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.15'>And the people felt regret for Benjamin; because that the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.16'>And the elders of the congregation said, What shall we do for those that remain as respecteth wives; because the women have been destroyed out of Benjamin?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.17'>And they said, Their inheritance must be secured for Benjamin, that not a tribe may be blotted out from Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.18'>Nevertheless we ourselves are not able to give them wives of our daughters; for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.19'>And they said, Behold, there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh from year to year at a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.20'>And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go ye and lie in wait in the vineyards;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.21'>And look out, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh go out to dance in dances: then come ye forth out of the vineyards, and snatch you every man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go then to the land of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.22'>And it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to contend with us, that we will say unto them, Be favorable unto them for our sakes; because we took not for each man his wife in the war; and because ye yourselves did not give them unto them, that ye should at this time be guilty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.23'>And the children of Benjamin did so, and took themselves wives, according to their number, from the dancers whom they had stolen away; and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and rebuilt the cities, and dwelt in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.24'>And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.25'>In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did what was right in his own eyes.</verse>
