And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the upper chamber, in which he abode, and he laid him upon his own bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he stretched himself out over the child three times, and called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, let, I pray thee, the soul of this child return again within him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Lord listened to the voice of Elijah: and the soul of the child returned into him, and he revived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the upper chamber into the house, and gave him unto his mother; and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this do I know, that thou art a man of God, and the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
