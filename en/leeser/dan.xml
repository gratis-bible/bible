      <chapter osisID='Dan.1'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.1'>In the third year of the reign of Jehoyakim the king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.2'>And the Lord gave up into his hand Yehoyakim the king of Judah, with part of the vessels of the house of God: and he brought them into the land of Shinar into the house of his god, namely, he brought the vessels into the treasurehouse of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.3'>And the king said unto Ashpenas, the chief of his eunuchs, that he should bring out of the children of Israel, and of the royal seed, and of the nobles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.4'>Certain lads in whom there should be no kind of blemish, but who should be handsome in appearance, and intelligent in all wisdom, and acquainted with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as should have the ability to serve in the kings palace, and that these should be taught the learning and the language of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.5'>And the king ordered for them a daily provision for its day of the kings food, and of the wine which he drank, and to educate them three years, so that at the end thereof they should serve before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.6'>Now there were among these of the children of Judah, Daniel, Chananyah, Mishael, and Azaryah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.7'>And the chief of the eunuchs assigned them names; and he assigned to Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Chananyah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azaryah, of Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.8'>But Daniel resolved in his heart that he would not defile himself with the food of the king, nor with the wine which he drank: and therefore he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not need to defile himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.9'>And God gave Daniel kindness and mercy before the chief of the eunuchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.10'>And the chief of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath ordered your food and your drink; for why should he see your face sadder looking than that of the lads who are of your age? and ye would thus endanger my head with the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.11'>Then said Daniel to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had given charge over Daniel, Chananyah, Mishael, and Azaryah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.12'>Prove, I beseech thee, thy servants, ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat, and water to drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.13'>And then let our countenances be looked at before thee, and the countenance of the lads that eat the food of the king: and as thou mayest see fitting, so deal with thy servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.14'>And he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.15'>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared better and fuller in flesh than that of all the lads who ate the food of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.16'>And the steward took away their apportioned food, and the wine that they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.17'>But as regardeth all these four lads, God gave them knowledge and intelligence in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.18'>And at the end of the days after which the king had said that they should be presented, the chief of the eunuchs presented them before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.19'>And the king spoke with them; and there was not found among them all any one like Daniel, Chananyah, Mishael, and Azaryah: and so they served before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.20'>And in every matter of wise understanding, which the king required of them, he found them ten times superior above all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.21'>And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.2'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.1'>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, whereat his spirit was troubled, and his sleep that was upon him was gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.2'>Then said the king to call the magicians, and the astrologers and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to solve for the king his dreams: and they came and placed themselves before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.3'>And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.4'>Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Aramic, O king, live for ever: recite the dream to thy servants, and we will tell the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.5'>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The decree is firmly resolved on by me: If ye do not make known unto me the dream with its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be changed into a dunghill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.6'>But if ye tell the dream and its interpretation, then shall ye receive gifts and rewards and great honor from me. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.7'>They answered the second time and said, Let the king recite the dream to his servants, and we will tell its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.8'>The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye wish to gain time, because ye see the decree is firmly resolved on by me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.9'>That if ye do not make known unto me the dream, there is but one sentence for you; for ye have prepared lying and deceptive words to speak before me, till the time be changed. Therefore relate to me the dream, and I shall know that ye can tell me its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.10'>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the habitable earth that can tell the kings matter: wherefore no mighty and powerful king ever hath asked such a thing of any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.11'>And the matter which the king requireth is difficult, and there is no other that can tell it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.12'>For all this cause the king became angry, and very furious; and he commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.13'>And the law went forth and some of the wise men were slain: and they sought Daniel and his companions to slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.14'>Then made Daniel representations with intelligence and prudence to Aryoch the captain of the kings guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.15'>He commenced and said to Aryoch the kings commander, Wherefore is the law so hasty from the king? Then made Aryoch the matter known to Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.16'>But Daniel went in, and requested of the king that he would give him time, that he might tell the interpretation to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.17'>Then went Daniel to his house, and made the matter known to Chananyah, Mishael, and Azaryah, his companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.18'>In order that they might pray for mercy of the God of heaven concerning this secret: so that Daniel and his companions might not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.19'>Thereupon was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then did Daniel bless the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.20'>Daniel commenced and said, May the name of God be blessed from eternity and to all eternity; for wisdom and might are his;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.21'>And he changeth times and seasons; he removeth kings, and raiseth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to those that possess understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.22'>He it is that revealeth what is deep and secret; he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.23'>To thee, O God of my father, do I give thanks, and I praise thee, who hast given me wisdom and might, and because thou hast made known unto me what we prayed for of thee; for thou hast made known unto us the kings matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.24'>Therefore did Daniel go in unto Aryoch, whom the king had ordered to destroy the wise men of Babylon, He went and said thus unto him, the wise men of Babylon must thou not destroy: bring me before the king, and I will tell unto the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.25'>Then did Aryoch bring Daniel before the king in haste, and thus he said unto him, Here have I found a man out of the children of the exiles of Judah, who will make known unto the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.26'>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.27'>Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded no wise men, astrologers, magicians, or soothsayers, can tell unto the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.28'>But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to king Nebuchadnezzar what is to be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy couch, were these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.29'>As for thee, O king, thy thoughts, when thou wast on thy couch, rose within thee concerning what is to come to pass hereafter; and the Revealer of secrets hath made known to thee what is to come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.30'>But as for me, this secret hath not been revealed to me because of any wisdom that is in me more than in all other living; but for the sake that men might make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest understand the thoughts of thy heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.31'>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold there was a large image; this image was mighty, and its brightness was excellent; it stood opposite to thee; and its form was fearinspiring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.32'>As regardeth this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms were of silver, its belly and its thighs of copper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.33'>Its legs of iron, its feet part of them of iron and part of them of clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.34'>Thou didst look on till the moment that a stone tore itself loose, not through human hands, and it struck the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and ground them to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.35'>Then were the iron, the clay, the copper, the silver, and the gold ground up together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no trace was found of them; and the stone that had stricken the image became a mighty mountain, and filled the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.36'>This is the dream; and its interpretation will we relate before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.37'>Thou, O king, art a king of kings, to whom the God of heaven hath given kingdom, power, and strength, and honor:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.38'>And wheresoever the children of men dwell, hath he given the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art the head of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.39'>And after thee there will arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of copper, which will bear rule over all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.40'>And the fourth kingdom will be as strong as iron; forasmuch as iron grindeth up and beateth down all things, and as iron that breaketh every thing, will it grind up and break all these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.41'>And that thou sawest the feet and toes, and part of them of potters clay, and part of them of iron, signifieth that it will be a divided kingdom, although there will be in it of the strength of the iron; forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mingled with miry clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.42'>And as the toes of the feet were part of them of iron, and part of them of clay: so will the kingdom be partly strong and partly brittle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.43'>And whereas thou sawest iron mingled with miry clay: so will they mingle themselves among the seed of men; but they will not cleave firmly one to another, even as iron cannot be mingled with clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.44'>But in the days of these kings will the God of heaven set up a kingdom: which shall to eternity not be destroyed, and its rule shall not be transferred to any other people; but it will grind up and make an end of all these kingdoms, while it will itself endure for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.45'>Whereas thou sawest that out of the mountain a stone tore itself loose, not through human hands, and that it ground up the iron, the copper, the clay, the silver, and the gold: the great God hath made known to the king what is to come to pass after this. And the dream is reliable, and its interpretation certain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.46'>Then did king Nebuchadnezzar fall upon his face, and he bowed down to Daniel, and ordered that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.47'>The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and the revealer of secrets; because thou hast been able to reveal this secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.48'>Then did the king elevate Daniel, and gave him many great presents, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the superintendents over all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.49'>Then requested Daniel of the king, that he might appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the public service of the province of Babylon; but Daniel remained in the gate of the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.3'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.1'>King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, the height of which was sixty cubits, and the breadth of which was six cubits: he set it up in the valley of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.2'>And king Nebuchadnezzar sent to assemble his lieutenants, the superintendents, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, those learned in the law, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which king Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.3'>Thereupon were assembled the lieutenants, the superintendents, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, those learned in the law, and all the rulers of the provinces unto the dedication of the image that king Nebuchadnezzar had set up; and they stood opposite to the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.4'>Then a herald called out with a loud voice, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.5'>That at the time when ye do hear the sound of the cornet, flute, guitar, harp, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye shall fall down and bow yourselves to the golden image which king Nebuchadnezzar hath set up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.6'>And whoso doth not fall down and bow himself shall in the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.7'>Therefore at the same time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, guitar, harp, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages fell down bowing themselves to the golden image which king Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.8'>Therefore at the same time certain Chaldean men came near, and accused the Jews treacherously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.9'>They commenced and said to king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.10'>Thou, O king, hadst made a decree, that every man that should hear the sound of the cornet, flute, guitar, harp, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, should fall down and bow himself to the golden image;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.11'>And that whoso should not fall down and bow himself should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.12'>There are certain Jewish men whom thou hast appointed over the public service of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: these men, O king, have not paid any regard to thee; thy god they do not worship, and to the golden image which thou hast set up they do not bow themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.13'>Then ordered Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then were these men brought before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.14'>Nebuchadnezzar commenced and said unto them, Is it out of disrespect, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego? My god ye do not worship, and to the golden image which I have set up ye do not bow yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.15'>Now then if ye be ready at the time when ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, guitar, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, to fall down and bow yourselves to the image which I have made, well ; but if ye bow yourselves not, ye shall be cast in the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace: and who is the God that can deliver you out of my hand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.16'>Then answered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee a word in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.17'>Behold, there is our God whom we worship, he is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace: and out of thy hand, O king, will he deliver us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.18'>But if not, then be it known unto thee, O king, that thy god will we not worship, and to the golden image which; thou hast set up will we not bow ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.19'>Then was Nebuchadnezzar filled with fury, and the form of his countenance was changed because of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; and he commenced and ordered that they should heat the furnace thoroughly seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.20'>And he ordered the mightiest men in strength that were in his army, to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.21'>Then were these men bound in their mantles, their undergarments, and their turbans, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.22'>Now, because the kings command was so urgent, and the furnace exceedingly heated, the flame of the fire slew those men that carried up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.23'>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.24'>Then was king Nebuchadnezzar astonished, and he rose up in haste, and commenced, and said unto his counsellors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, Certainly, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.25'>He answered and said, Lo, I see four men unbound, walking in the midst of the fire, and there is no injury on them; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.26'>Then came Nebuchadnezzar near to the door of the burning fiery furnace, commenced, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, step forth, and come hither. Then stepped Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego forth out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.27'>And the lieutenants, superintendents, and governors, and the kings counsellors, being assembled together, saw these men, over whose bodies the fire had had no power, and the hair of whose head was not singed, whose mantles were not changed, and on whom there was not come the smell of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.28'>Then commenced Nebuchadnezzar, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that had trusted in him, and had transgressed the kings word, and yielded up their bodies, that they might not worship no bow themselves to any god, except their own God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.29'>Therefore do I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, that may speak any thing disrespectful against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be changed into a dunghill; because there is no other God that can deliver like this one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.30'>Then did the king promote Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.</verse>

          <note>(4:6)</note> O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, of whom I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and that no secret is concealed from thee, tell me the visions of my dream which I have seen, with its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.10'>
          <note>(4:7)</note> And the visions of my head on my couch were, that I saw, and behold, there was a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.11'>
          <note>(4:8)</note> The tree grew, and was strong, and its height reached unto heaven, and it was visible to the end of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.12'>
          <note>(4:9)</note> Its foliage was splendid, and its fruit large, and on it was food for all: under it sought the beasts of the field for shade, and in its boughs dwelt the fowls of heaven, and from it was fed all flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.13'>
          <note>(4:10)</note> I saw in the visions of my head on my couch, and, behold, a watcher who was also a holy one came down from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.14'>
          <note>(4:11)</note> He called with might, and thus he said, Hew down the trees and lop off its branches, strip off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the beasts flee away from under it, and the fowls from among its branches:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.15'>
          <note>(4:12)</note> Nevertheless leave the body of its roots in the earth, but bound with fetters of iron and copper, among the grass of the field; and let it be made wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts on the herbage of the earth;</verse>

          <note>(4:13)</note> Let his heart be changed not to be human, and let a beasts heart be given unto him; and let seven times elapse over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.17'>
          <note>(4:14)</note> Through the resolve of the watchers is this decree, and by the order of the holy ones is this decision: to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and that he can give it to whomsoever he pleaseth, and can set up over it the lowest of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.18'>
          <note>(4:15)</note> This dream have I, king Nebuchadnezzar, seen; but thou, O Belteshazzar, relate its interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.19'>
          <note>(4:16)</note> Then was Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, astounded for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king then commenced, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or its interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, O that the dream might be for those that hate thee, and its interpretation for thy enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.20'>
          <note>(4:17)</note> The tree that thou hast seen, which grew, and was strong, the height of which reached unto the heaven, and which was visible to all the earth;</verse>

          <note>(4:18)</note> The foliage of which was splendid, and the fruit of which was large, and on which was food for all; under which dwelt the beasts of the field, and in the boughs of which nestled the fowls of the heaven:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.4.23'>
          <note>(4:20)</note> And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, who said, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the body of its roots in the earth, but bound in fetters of iron and copper, among the grass of the field; and let it be made wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times elapse over it:</verse>

          <note>(4:21)</note> This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the resolve of the Most High, which will come over my lord the king:</verse>

          <note>(4:22)</note> They will drive thee away from men, and with the beasts of the field is thy dwelling to be, and they will suffer thee to eat herbs like oxen, and they will suffer thee to be made wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times will elapse over thee; until that thou wilt know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he pleaseth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.26'>
          <note>(4:23)</note> And whereas they ordered to leave the body of the roots of the tree: thy kingdom will remain unto thee, as soon as thou wilt know that the Heavens do rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.27'>
          <note>(4:24)</note> Therefore, O king, let my counsel be agreeable unto thee, and atone for thy sins by righteousness, and for thy iniquities by showing kindness to the poor: perhaps thy prosperity may thereby endure long.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.28'>
          <note>(4:25)</note> All this came over king Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>

          <note>(4:28)</note> The word was still in the kings mouth, when there fell a voice from heaven, saying, To thee it is said, O king Nebuchadnezzar, The kingdom departeth from thee.</verse>

          <note>(4:29)</note> And from men will they drive thee away, and with the beasts of the field shall thy dwelling be; herbs like oxen will they suffer thee to eat, and seven times shall elapse over thee: until thou wilt know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he pleaseth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.33'>
          <note>(4:30)</note> At the same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and from men was he driven away, and herbs like oxen had he to eat, and with the dew of heaven was his body made wet: till his hair was grown like eagles feathers, and his nails were like birds claws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.34'>
          <note>(4:31)</note> But at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes unto heaven, and my understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and glorified the Everliving, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and whose kingdom is over every generation;</verse>

          <note>(4:33)</note> At the same time my understanding returned unto me; and with the glory of my kingdom, my honor and my splendor returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought for me: and I was replaced in my kingdom, and additional greatness was added unto me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.7.1'>In the first year of Belshazzar the king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and the visions of his head while on his couch: afterward he wrote down the dream, relating the principal things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.2'>Daniel commenced and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven blew fiercely on the great sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.3'>And four great beasts came up from the sea, differing one from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.4'>the first was like a lion, and had eagles wings: I looked till its wings were plucked out, and it was lifted up from the earth, and was placed upon its feet as a man, and a human heart was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.5'>And behold there was another, a second beast, like a bear, and on one side was it placed, with three ribs in its mouth between its teeth: and thus they said unto it, Arise, eat much flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.6'>After this I looked, and lo there was another, like a leopard; and it had four wings of a bird on its back: the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given unto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.7'>After this I looked in the night visions, and behold there was a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and ground up, and what was left it stamped with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.8'>I looked carefully at the horns, and, behold, another little horn came up between them, and three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots before the same; and, behold, there were eyes like the eyes of man in this horn, with a mouth speaking presumptuous things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.9'>I was looking until chairs were set down, and an Ancient of days seated himself, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of whose head was like clean wool; his chair was like flames of fire, and his wheels like fire that burnt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.10'>A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him; thousand times thousands ministered unto him, and myriad times myriads stood before him: they sat down to hold judgment, and the books were opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.11'>I looked then, because of the sound of the presumptuous words which the horn had spoken,I looked till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and given over to the burning fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.12'>But concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet a longer duration of life was given unto them until the time and period.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.13'>I looked in the nightly visions, and, behold, with the clouds of heaven came one like a son of man, and he attained as far as the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.14'>And there were given him dominion, and dignity, and government, and all people, nations, and languages had to serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom is one which shall never be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.15'>My spirit was deeply shaken within me, Daniel, in the midst of its tenement, and the visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.16'>I came near unto one of those that stood by, and asked him something certain concerning all this: and he spoke to me, and made known unto me the interpretation of the things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.17'>These great beasts, of which there are four, are four kings, who are to arise on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.18'>But the saints of the Most High will obtain the kingdom, and possess the kingdom to eternity, even to all eternity for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.19'>Then I desired what is certain concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all these others, exceedingly dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and whose nails of copper; which devoured, ground up, and stamped with its feet what was left;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.20'>And concerning the ten horns that were in its head, and concerning the other which came up, and before which three fell down, even concerning that horn which had eyes, and a mouth which spoke presumptuous things, and whose appearance was greater than that of its companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.21'>I had seen how the same horn had made war with the saints, and had prevailed against them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.22'>Until the Ancient of days came, and procured justice unto the saints of the Most High; and the time came and the saints took possession of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.23'>Thus said he, The fourth beast signifieth that a fourth kingdom will be upon earth, which is to be different from all kingdoms, and will devour all the earth, and will tread it down, and grind it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.24'>And the ten horns out of this kingdom signify that ten kings will arise; and another will rise after them, and he will be different from the first, and three kings will he bring low.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.25'>And he will speak words against the Most High, and the saints of the Most High will he oppress, and think to change the festivals and the law: and they will be given up into his hand until a time and times and half a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.26'>But they will sit down to hold judgment, and they will take away his dominion, to destroy and to annihilate it unto the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.27'>And the kingdom and the dominion, and the power over the kingdoms under the whole heaven, will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all governments are to worship and obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.28'>Thus far is the end of the speech. As for me Daniel, my reflections troubled me greatly, and my color was changed on me; but I kept the speech in my heart.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.8'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.1'>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, to me Daniel, after that which had appeared unto me at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.2'>And I saw in the visionand it came to pass, in my seeing, that I was at Shushan the capital, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, as though I was by the river Ulai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.3'>And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there was a ram standing before the river, and he had two horns; and the horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.4'>I saw the ram butting westward, and northward, and southward; so that all the beasts could not stand before him, and no one was there to deliver out of his hand: and he did according to his will, and became great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.5'>And as I was looking attentively, behold, there came a shaggy, hegoat from the west over the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a sightly large horn between his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.6'>And he came as far as the ram that had two horns, that I had seen standing before the river, and ran at him with his furious power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.7'>And I saw him coming close unto the ram, and he became bitterly enraged against him, and he struck the ram, and broke his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand forward before him: and he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him; and there was no one to deliver the ram out of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.8'>And the shaggy hegoat became very great: but when he was grown strong, the great horn was broken; and there came up four slightly large ones in its place toward the four winds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.9'>And out of them came forth a little horn, which became exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.10'>And it became great, even up to the host of the heavens; and it cast down to the ground some of the host and of the stars, and trod them under foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.11'>Yea, it magnified itself even up to the prince of the host, and by it the continual sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.12'>And the host is given up together with the continual sacrifice, by reason of transgression: and it casteth down the truth to the ground, and it doth this, and is prosperous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.13'>Then did I hear a certain holy one speaking, and a holy one said unto the unknown one who was speaking, For how long is the vision concerning the continual sacrifice, and the wasting transgression, to give up both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.14'>And he said unto me, Until two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings, when the sanctuary shall be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.15'>And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, saw the vision, and sought for understanding, that, behold, there was standing opposite to me something like the appearance of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.16'>And I heard the voice of a man between the banks of the Ulai, and it called, and said, Gabriel, cause this one to understand this appearance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.17'>So he came close to where I stood: and when he came, I was terrified, and I fell upon my face; but he said unto me, Mark it well, O son of man; because for the time of the end is the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.18'>Now as he was speaking with me, I fell down in amazement on my face to the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright where I had been standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.19'>And he said, Behold, I will make known unto thee what is to be at the last end of the indignation; for it is for the appointed time of the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.20'>The ram that thou hast seen, him with the two horns, signifieth the kings of Media and Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.21'>And the shaggy hegoat is the king of Javan; and the great horn which is between his eyes is the first king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.22'>But that it was broken, and that four sprung up in its stead, signifieth that four kingdoms will spring up out of the nation, but not with his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.23'>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have filled their measure of guilt, there will arise a king of an impudent face, and understanding deep schemes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.24'>And his power will be mighty, but not by his own power; and he will destroy wonderfully, and will prosper while he doth this; and he will destroy very many and the people of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.25'>And through his intelligence, and because he prospereth, is craftiness in his hand; and in his heart will he magnify himself, and in peace will he destroy many: he will also stand up against the Prince of princes; but without a human hand will he be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.26'>And the appearance of the evening and the morning which was spoken of is true: but do thou keep the vision closed up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.27'>And I Daniel grieved, and was sick several days; afterward I rose up, and did the kings business; and I was depressed because of the appearance; but no one observed it.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.9'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.1'>In the first year of Darius the son of Achashverosh, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.2'>In the first year of his reign, I Daniel searched in the books for understanding concerning the number of the years whereof the word of the Lord had come to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would let pass full seventy years over the ruins of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.3'>And I directed my face unto the Lord God, to ask by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and in sackcloth, and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.4'>And I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and terrible God, who keepeth the covenant and kindness to those that love him, and to those that keep his commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.5'>We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, and have departed from thy commandments and from thy ordinances;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.6'>Nor have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, who spoke in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.7'>Thine, O Lord, is the righteousness, but unto us belongeth the shame of face, as it is this day,to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, those that are near, and those that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass which they have trespassed against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.8'>O Lord, to us belongeth the shame of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers; because we have sinned against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.9'>To the Lord our God belong mercies and pardonings; for we have rebelled against him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.10'>And we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us through means of his servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.11'>Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, and have departed so as not to obey thy voice: therefore was poured out over us the curse, with the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; because we had sinned against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.12'>And he hath accomplished his words, which he had spoken concerning us, and concerning our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil, which was never done under the whole heaven as it hath been done in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.13'>As it is written in the law of Moses; all this evil came over us: yet offered we not any entreaty before the Lord our God, to return from our iniquities, and to become intelligent in thy truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.14'>Therefore did the Lord watch over the evil, and he brought it upon us; for the Lord our God is righteous because of all his deeds which he hath done; but we have not obeyed his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.15'>And now, O Lord our God, who hast brought forth thy people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand, and hast made thyself a great name, as it is this day: we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.16'>O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thy anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; because through our sins, and through the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all who are round about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.17'>And now listen, O our God, to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary which is desolate, for the sake of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.18'>Incline, O my God, thy ear, and hear; open thy eyes, and look on our desolations, and the city whereupon thy name is called: for not relying on our acts of righteousness do we present humbly our supplications before thee, but relying on thy great mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.19'>O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do it; delay it not; for thy own sake, O my God; for thy name is called upon thy city and upon thy people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.9.21'>Yea, while I was yet speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, came, flying swiftly, near me about the time of the evening oblation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.9.23'>At the beginning of thy supplications the word went forth, and I am come to tell it; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and have understanding of the appearance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.24'>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to close up the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to atone for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.25'>Know therefore and comprehend, that from the going forth of the word to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the anointed the prince will be seven weeks: and during sixty and two weeks will it be again built with streets and ditches around it, even in the pressure of the times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.26'>And after the sixty and two weeks will an anointed one be cut off without a successor to follow him: and the city and the sanctuary will the people of the prince that is coming destroy; but his end will come in a violent overthrow; but until the end of the war devastations are decreed against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.27'>And he will make a strong covenant with the many for one week; and in the half of the week will he cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and this because of the prevalence of the abominations which bringeth devastation, and until destruction and what is decreed shall be poured out upon the waster.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.10.6'>And his body was also like the chrysolite, and his face, like the appearance of lightning, and his eyes were like torches of fire, and his arms and his feet, like the color of polished copper, and the sound of his words was like the noise of a multitude.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.11.33'>And the intelligent among the people will impart understanding to many: yet they will stumble through the sword, and through flame, through captivity, and through being plundered for some time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.34'>But in their stumbling will they be aided with a little help: but many will join themselves to them with deceptive flatteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.35'>And some of the intelligent will stumble, to make a purification among them, and to select and to cleanse them, until the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.36'>And the king will do according to his pleasure; and he will exalt and magnify himself above every god, and against the God of gods will he speak incredible things, and he will prosper till the indignation be at an end; for that which is determined will be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.37'>And to the gods of his fathers will he pay no regard; and to the desire of women, or to any god whatever will he not pay any regard; for above all will he magnify himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.38'>But in his place he will pay honor to the god of the fortresses; and to a god whom his fathers knew not will he pay honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and costly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.39'>This will he do for the very strong fortresses together with the strange god: whoever will acknowledge him, him will he give much honor; and he will cause such to rule over many, and he will divide out the land for a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.40'>And at the time of the end will the king of the south push against him; and the king of the north will come against him like a stormwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he will enter into some countries, and will overflow and press along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.41'>And he will enter into the glorious land, and much will be overthrown; but these will escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the first portion of the children of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.42'>And he will stretch forth his hand against some countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.43'>And he will have control over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the costly things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians will follow at his steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.44'>But reports out of the east and out of the north will terrify him; and he will go forth with great fury to destroy, and to exterminate many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.45'>And he will pitch the tents of his palace between seas and the glorious holy mountain; and he will come to his end, without one to help him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.12'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.1'>And at that time will Michael, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people, stand forth; and there will be a time of distress, such as hath never been since the existence of any nation, until that same time; and at that time shall thy people be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.2'>And many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to disgrace and everlasting abhorrence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.3'>And the intelligent shall shine brilliantly like the brilliance of the expanse of the sky; and they that bring many to righteousness shall be like the stars, for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.4'>But thou, O Daniel, close up the words, and seal the book, until the time of the end: many will roam about, yet shall knowledge be increased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.5'>Then I Daniel looked, and behold, there were two others standing, the one on this side of the bank of the stream, and the other on that side of the bank of the stream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.6'>And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.7'>Then heard I the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream; and he lifted up his right hand and his left hand unto the heavens, and swore by the Everliving One that after a time, times, and a half, and when there shall be an end to the crushing of the power of the holy people, all these things shall be ended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.8'>And I heard indeed, but I understood it not: then said I, O my lord, what shall be the end of these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.9'>And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.10'>Many shall be selected and cleansed, and purified; but the wicked will deal wickedly, and none of the wicked will understand: but the intelligent will understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.11'>And from the time that the continual sacrifice will be removed, even to set up the desolating abomination, there will be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.12'>Happy is he that waiteth, and attaineth to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.13'>But thou, go thy way toward the end; and thou shalt rest, and arise again for thy lot at the end of the days.</verse>
