      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>Now king David was old, stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he could not become warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let them seek out for my lord the king a young virgin, and let her stand before the king, and let her be an attendant on him; and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may become warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>So they sought for a fair maiden throughout all the territory of Israel; and they found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>And the maiden was exceedingly fair; and she became an attendant on the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>And Adoniyah the son of Chaggith exalted himself, saying, I shall be king: and he procured himself a chariot and horsemen, and fifty men who ran before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>And his father had never grieved him in all his life by saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was of a very goodly form; and his mother had born him after Abshalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>And he had conferences with Joab the son of Zeruyah, and with Ebyathar the priest: and they, following Adoniyah, helped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But Zadok the priest, and Benayahu the son of Yehoyada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimi, and Rei, and the mighty men that belonged to David, were not with Adoniyah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>And Adoniyah slaughtered sheep and oxen and fatted cattle by the stone Zocheleth, which is by Enrogel; and he invited all his brothers the kings sons, and all the men of Judah the kings servants;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>But Nathan the prophet, and Benayahu, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he invited not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>And Nathan spoke unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adoniyah the son of Chaggith is become king, and that David our lord knoweth it not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>And now come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thy own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly, Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and only he shall sit upon my throne? why then is Adoniyah become king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>And, lo, while thou shalt be yet speaking there with the king, I myself will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber, and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>And Bathsheba bowed, and prostrated herself unto the king: and the king said, What wouldst thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>And she said unto him, My lord, thou thyself didst swear by the Lord thy God unto thy handmaid, Assuredly, Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and only he shall sit upon my throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>And now, behold, Adoniyah is become king; and now, my lord, O king, thou knowest it not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>And he hath slaughtered oxen and fatted cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath invited all the sons of the king, and Ebyathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army; but Solomon thy servant hath he not invited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>And as for thee, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, to tell them, who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>Otherwise it would come to pass, when my lord the king sleepeth with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon may be counted offenders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>And, lo, while she was yet speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>And they told the king, saying, Behold, here is Nathan the prophet: and when he was come in before the king, he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou then said, Adoniyah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>For he is gone down this day, and hath slaughtered oxen and fatted cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath invited all the kings sons, and the captains of the army, and Ebyathar the priest: and, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and they say, Long live king Adoniyah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>But as for me, me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benayahu the son of Yehoyada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not invited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>Can it be that this hath been done by order of my lord the king, and thou hast not informed thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>Then answered king David, and said, Call me Bathsheba; and she came into the kings presence, and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>And the king swore and said, As the Lord liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>Even as I have sworn unto thee by the Lord the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and only he shall sit upon my throne in my stead: even so will I certainly do this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>Then did Bathsheba bow herself with her face to the earth, and prostrate herself unto the king; and she said, May my lord, the king David, live for ever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>And king David said, Call unto me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benayahu the son of Yehoyada. And they came before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>And the king said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and conduct him down to Gichon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>And let Zadok the priest with Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel; and blow ye with the cornet, and say, Long live king Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>Then shall ye go up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; and he shall be king in my stead: and him have I ordained to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>And Benayahu the son of Yehoyada answered the king, and said, Amen: May thus say the Eternal the God of my lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>As the Eternal hath been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and may he make his throne greater than the throne of my lord the king David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>Thereupon Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benayahu the son of Yehoyada, and the Kerethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king Davids mule, and conducted him to Gichon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew with the cornet; and all the people said, Long live king Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>And all the people went up after him, and the people blew on flutes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth was rent at their noise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>And Adoniyah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had just finished eating: and when Joab heard the sound of the cornet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city in an uproar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>And while he was yet speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Ebyathar the priest came in: and Adoniyah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and must bring good tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>And Jonathan answered and said to Adoniyah, Alas, no; our lord king David hath made Solomon king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benayahu the son of Yehoyada, and the Kerethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the kings mule;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him as king on the Gichon; and they are come up from there rejoicing, and the city hath been set in commotion. This is the noise that ye have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>And Solomon hath also sat on the kingly throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>And also the kings servants are come to bless our lord king David, saying, May God make the name of Solomon more famous than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne: and the king hath bowed himself upon the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>And also thus hath the king said, Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who hath given me this day one who sitteth on my throne, while my eyes see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>And all the guests that were with Adoniyah were terrified, and rose up, and went, every man, on his own way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>And Adoniyah was afraid because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>And it was told unto Solomon, saying, Behold, Adoniyah feareth king Solomon; and, behold, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>And Solomon said, If he will become a worthy man, there shall not a hair of his fall to the earth; but if any wrong shall be found on him, then shall he die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar; and he came and bowed himself to king Solomon; and Solomon said unto him, Go to thy house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>And when the days of David drew near that he should die, he charged Solomon his son, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>I am going the way of all the earth; but be thou strong, and become a man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses; in order that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>In order that the Lord may fulfill his word which he hath spoken concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall never fail thee, said he, a man on the throne of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>And thou also knowest well what Joab the son of Zeruyah hath done to me, what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amassa the son of Yether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and on his shoes that were on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head go down in peace to the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>But unto the sons of Barzillai the Giladite show thou kindness, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they came near to me when I fled from before Abshalom thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimi the son of Gera, the Benjamite of Bachurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day when I went to Machanayim; but who came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>But now leave him not unpunished; for thou art a wise man; know then what thou oughtest to do unto him, and bring thou down his hoary head with blood to the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>And Adoniyah the son of Chaggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon: and she said, Is thy coming for peace? And he said, For peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>He said moreover, I have a word for thee. And she said, Speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>And he said, Thou well knowest that mine was the kingdom, and that on me all Israel had set their faces, that I should reign: nevertheless the kingdom was turned about, and became my brothers; for from the Lord was it made his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>And now there is one petition I am going to ask of thee, do not turn me away. And she said unto him, Speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, for he will not turn thee away, that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite for wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>And Bathsheba said, Well: I will speak for thee unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>Bathsheba thereupon went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adoniyah; and the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and then sat down on his throne, and placed a chair for the kings mother; and she sat on his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>Then said she, There is one small petition I am going to ask of thee; do not turn me away. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not turn thee away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adoniyah thy brother for wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adoniyah? rather ask for him the kingdom; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Ebyathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruyah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>Then swore king Solomon by the Lord, saying, May God do so to me, and may he thus continue, if Adoniyah have not spoken this word against his own life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>And now, as the Lord liveth, who hath established me, and seated me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he hath spoken, this very day shall Adoniyah be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benayahu the son of Yehoyada; and he fell upon him so that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>And unto Ebyathar the priest said the king, Go to Anathoth, unto thy own fields; for thou art a man worthy of death; but on this day will I not put thee to death; because thou hast borne the ark of the Lord Eternal before David my father, and because thou was afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>So Solomon banished Ebyathar that he should not be priest unto the Lord, to fulfill the word of the Lord, which he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>And the report came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adoniyah, though he had not turned after Abshalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>And it was told to king Solomon that Joab had fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord; and that, behold, he was close by the altar. Then sent Solomon Benayahu the son of Yehoyada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>And Benayahu came to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said unto him, Thus hath said the king, Come forth. And he said, No; but here will I die. And Benayahu brought the king word again, saying, Thus hath Joab spoken, and thus hath he answered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>Then said the king unto him, Do as he hath spoken, and fall upon him, and bury him; and remove thus the innocent blood, which Joab hath shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>And may the Lord bring back his bloodguiltiness upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, while my father David knew it not, Abner the son of Ner, the captain of the army of Israel, and Amassa the son of Yether, the captain of the army of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>And their blood shall return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever; but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto his house, and unto his throne, may there be peace for ever from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.34'>So Benayahu the son of Yehoyada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.35'>And the king appointed Benayahu the son of Yehoyada in his place over the army; and Zadok the priest did the king appoint in the place of Ebyathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.36'>And the king sent and called for Shimi, and said unto him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and thou shalt not go forth from there hither or thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.37'>And it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thy own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.38'>And Shimi said unto the king, It is well: as my Lord the king hath spoken, so will thy servant do. And Shimi dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.39'>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two servants of Shimi ran away unto Achish the son of Maachah the king of Gath: and they told unto Shimi, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.40'>And Shimi arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants; and Shimi went, and brought his servants from Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.41'>And it was told to Solomon that Shimi had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.42'>And the king sent and called for Shimi, and said unto him, Did I not make thee swear by the Lord, and warned thee, saying, On that day thou goest out, and walkest abroad hither or thither, know for certain that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, It is well, I have heard?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.43'>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment with which I charged thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.44'>The king said moreover to Shimi, Thou well knowest all the wickedness of which thy heart is conscious, that thou hast done to David my father: and the Lord bringeth back thy wickedness upon thy own head;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.45'>But king Solomon will be blessed, and the throne of David will be established before the Lord for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.46'>So the king commanded Benayahu the son of Yehoyada, who went out, and fell upon him, so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>And Solomon intermarried with Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and took the daughter of Pharaoh, and brought her into the city of David, until he had finished building his own house, and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>But the people sacrificed still on the highplaces; because there was no house built unto the name of the Lord, until those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of David his father: only that he sacrificed and burnt incense on the highplaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>And the king went to Gibon to sacrifice there; for that was the great highplace: one thousand burntofferings did Solomon offer upon that altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.5'>In Gibon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream of the night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.6'>And Solomon said, Thou hast shown unto thy servant David my father great kindness, just as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, and thou hast given him a son who sitteth on his throne, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.7'>And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant king in the place of David my father: and I am but a young lad; I know not how to go out or come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.8'>And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot he numbered nor counted for multitude.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.1'>And it came to pass after these events, that Naboth the Yizreelite had a vineyard, which was in Yizreel, near the palace of Achab the king of Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.2'>And Achab spoke unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that it may serve me for a herbgarden, because it is near unto my house; and I will give thee in its stead a vineyard better than it; or, if it seem good in thy eyes, I will give thee the money, the value of the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.3'>And Naboth said to Achab, Far be it from me before the Lord, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.4'>And Achab came into his house lowspirited and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Yizreelite had spoken to him, when he said, I will not give unto thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid himself down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.5'>But Izebel his wife came to him, and spoke unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad! and why eatest thou no food?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.6'>And he said unto her, Because I spoke unto Naboth the Yizreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee a vineyard in its stead; but he hath said, I will not give unto thee my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.7'>Then said unto him Izebel his wife, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, eat bread, and let thy heart be merry: I will myself give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Yizreelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.8'>So she wrote letters in Achabs name, and sealed them with his seal; and she sent the letters unto the elders and unto the nobles who were in his city, and who dwelt near Naboth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.9'>And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and cause Naboth to sit at the head of the people;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.11'>And the men of his city, the elders and the nobles, those who dwelt in his city, did as Izebel had sent unto them, as was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.12'>They proclaimed a fast, and caused Naboth to sit at the head of the people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.16'>And it came to pass, when Achab heard that Naboth was dead, that Achab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Yizreelite, to take possession of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.17'>And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.18'>Arise, go down to meet Achab the king of Israel, who is in Samaria; behold he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.19'>And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus hath said the Lord, Hast thou murdered, and also taken possession?

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.20'>And Achab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to do what is evil in the eyes of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.21'>Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and I will sweep out after thee, and will cut off from Achab every male, and the guarded and fortified in Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.22'>And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Basha the son of Achiyah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and induced Israel to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.23'>And also concerning Izebel hath the Lord spoken, saying, The dogs shall eat Izebel in the valley of Yizreel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.25'>But indeed there was none like unto Achab, who sold himself to do what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, to which Izebel his wife incited him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.26'>And he acted very abominably in following the idols, in all things just as had done the Emorites, whom the Lord had driven out from before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.27'>And it came to pass, when Achab heard these words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and slept in the sackcloth, and walked about barefooted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.28'>And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.29'>Hast thou seen how Achab hath humbled himself before me? therefore, because he hath humbled himself before me, will I not bring the evil in his days: in the days of his son will I bring the evil upon his house.</verse>
