      <chapter osisID='2Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.1'>Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from smiting the Amalekites, that David abode in Ziklag two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.2'>And it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and it happened, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and prostrated himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.3'>And David said unto him, From where comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.4'>And David said unto him, What took place there? I pray thee, tell me. And he said, That the people are fled from the battle, and that also many of the people are fallen and have died; and that also Saul and Jonathan his son are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.5'>And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul is dead as also Jonathan his son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.6'>And the young man that told him said, I happened entirely by chance to be upon mount Gilboa, when, behold, there was Saul leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen had overtaken him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.7'>And he turned round, and he saw me, and called unto me, And I said, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.8'>And he said unto me, Who art thou! And I answered him, An Amalekite am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.9'>And he said unto me, Place thyself, I pray thee, by me, and slay me; for a mortal tremor hath seized on me, although my life is yet whole in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.10'>So I placed myself by him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after his fall; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and I have brought them unto my lord hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.11'>David thereupon took hold of his clothes, and rent them; and so did likewise all the men that were with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.12'>And they lamented, and wept, and fasted until the evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.13'>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he said, The son of a stranger, an Amalekite, am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.14'>And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thy hand to destroy the Lords anointed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.15'>And David called one of the young men, and said, Come near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.16'>And David said unto him, Thy blood is upon thy own head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I myself have slain the Lords anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.17'>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.18'>And he said, That the children of Judah should be taught the bow; behold it is written in the book of Yashar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.19'>O beauty of Israel! upon the high places slain: how are the mighty fallen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.20'>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; that the daughters of the Philistines may not be glad, that the daughters of the uncircumcised may not rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.21'>O mountains of Gilboa, no dew, nor rain be upon you, nor fields of offerings; for there the shield of the mighty was stained, the shield of Saul, as though it had not been anointed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.22'>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned never back, and the sword of Saul never returned empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.23'>Saul and Jonathan, the beloved and the dear in their lives, were even in their death not divided: more than eagles were they swift, more than lions were they strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.24'>O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with beautiful dresses, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.25'>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, on thy high places slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.26'>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan; very dear hast thou been unto me: wonderful was thy love for me, passing the love of women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.27'>How are the mighty fallen, and lost the instruments of war!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.1'>And it came to pass after this, that David asked counsel of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah? And the Lord said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.2'>So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Achinoam the Yizreelitess, and Abigayil, Nabals wife, the Carmelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.3'>And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household; and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.4'>And then came the men of Judah, and they anointed there David as king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, The men of Yabeshgilad were those that buried Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.5'>And David thereupon sent messengers unto the men of Yabeshgilad, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the Lord, that ye have done this kindness unto your Lord, unto Saul, and have buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.6'>And now may the Lord deal with you in kindness and truth: and as for me also, I will requite you this good deed, because ye have done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.7'>And now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant men; for your lord Saul is dead; and also me have the house of Judah anointed as king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.8'>But Abner, the son of Ner, the captain of the army of Saul, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Machanayim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.9'>And made him king over Gilad, and over the Ashurites, and over Yizreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.10'>Forty years old was Ishbosheth the son of Saul, when he became king over Israel, and two years he reigned. But the house of Judah followed David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.11'>And the number of days that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.12'>And there went out Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, from Machanayim to Gibon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.13'>And Joab the son of Zeruyah and the servants of David also went out, and they met together by the pool of Gibon: and they sat down, these on the one side of the pool, and the others on the other side of the pool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.14'>And Abner said to Joab, Do let the young men rise up and play before us. And Joab said, They may rise up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.15'>Then they rose up and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.16'>And they grasped every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellows side; and they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Chelkathhazzurim, which is by Gibon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.17'>And the battle was exceedingly fierce on that day; and Abner with the men of Israel was beaten, before the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.18'>And there were at that place three sons of Zeruyah, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as fleet of foot as any roe in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.19'>And Asahel pursued after Abner; and he turned not in going to the right hand or to the left from following Abner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.20'>And Abner turned round and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.21'>And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay hold for thyself on one of the young men, and take thyself his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.22'>And Abner repeated again to say unto Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? and how should I then lift up my face to Joab thy brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.23'>But he refused to turn aside; and Abner smote him with the hinder end of the spear under the fifth rib, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died on the spot: and it came to pass, that all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen down and died remained standing still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.24'>But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giach on the way to the wilderness of Gibon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.25'>And the children of Benjamin assembled themselves together behind Abner, and formed one solid body, and posted themselves on the top of a certain hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.26'>And Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall for everlasting the sword devour? knowest thou not that it will be bitter in the end? and how long shall it be, ere thou wilt bid the people to return from pursuing their brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.27'>And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then already in the morning would the people have gone away every one from pursuing his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.28'>So Joab blew the cornet, and all the people remained standing still, and pursued no more after Israel, and they continued no more to fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.29'>And Abner and his men walked through the plain all that night, and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Machanayim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.30'>And Joab returned from pursuing Abner; and he gathered all the people together; and there were missed of Davids servants nineteen men and Asahel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.31'>But the servants of David had smitten many of Benjamin, and of Abners men: three hundred and sixty men died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.32'>And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlechem. And Joab and his men went all that night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.1'>And the war lasted a long time between the house of Saul and the house of David; but David became continually stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul became continually weaker and weaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.2'>And there were born unto David sons in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Achinoam the Yizreelitess;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.3'>And his second was Kilab, of Abigayil the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Abshalom, the son of Maachah the daughter of Talmai the king of Geshur;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.4'>And the fourth, Adoniyah, the son of Chaggith; and the fifth, Shephatyah, the son of Abital;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.5'>And the sixth, Yithream, by Eglah, Davids wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.6'>And it came to pass, while the war lasted between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner upheld with all his strength the house of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.7'>And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Ayah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my fathers concubine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.8'>And Abner became very wroth because of the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I the chief of the dogs which belong to Judah? unto this day have I shown kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David; and yet thou chargest me today with a wrong committed with this woman?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.9'>May God do so to Abner, and continue to do yet more to him, that, as the Lord hath sworn to David, even so will I surely do to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.10'>To transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.11'>And he could not answer Abner a word more in reply, because of his fear of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.12'>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy covenant with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring round unto thee all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.13'>And he said, Well: I will indeed make a covenant with thee; but one thing I require of thee, namely, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal, Sauls daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.14'>And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, saying, Give up to me my wife Michal, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.15'>And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from the man, from Paltiel the son of Layish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.16'>And her husband went with her going along and weeping behind her as far as Bachurim: when Abner said unto him, Go, return. And he returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.17'>And Abner had used these words with the elders of Israel, saying, Already yesterday and even before ye have been desiring David as king over you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.18'>And now do it; for the Lord hath said of David thus, By the hand of my servant David will I save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.19'>And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin; and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good in the eyes of Israel, and in the eyes of the whole house of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.20'>And Abner came to David to Hebron, and with him were twenty men; and David made for Abner and for the men that were with him a feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.21'>And Abner said unto David, I will now arise and go, and I will assemble unto my Lord the king all Israel, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul longeth for. And David dismissed Abner: and he went in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.22'>And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a predatory excursion, and brought in much booty with them; but Abner was no more with David in Hebron; for he had dismissed him, and he was gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.23'>When Joab and all the army that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath dismissed him, and he is gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.24'>Then came Joab to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee: why is it that thou hast dismissed him, that he went freely away?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.25'>Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that to deceive thee did he come, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou art doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.26'>And Joab went out from David, and he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David knew it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.27'>And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him in private; and he smote him there under the fifth rib, and he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.28'>And when David heard it afterward, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.29'>May it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his fathers house; and may there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a crutch, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.30'>But Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibon in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.31'>And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird yourselves with sackcloth, and go mourning before Abner. And king David walked behind the bier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.32'>And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.33'>And the king lamented over Abner, and said, O, that Abner had to die, as the worthless dieth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.34'>Thy hands were not bound, and thy feet were not put into fetters: as one falleth before men of wickedness art thou fallen. And all the people wept again over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.35'>And all the people came to cause David to eat food while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, So do God to me, and thus may he continue, if before the sun be down I taste bread, or the least else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.36'>And all the people took notice of it, and it was pleasing in their eyes: as whatsoever the king did was pleasing in the eyes of all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.37'>And all the people and all Israel understood on that day that it had not been of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.38'>And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that a prince and a great man hath fallen this day in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.39'>And I am this day yet weak, and just anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruyah, are too strong for me: may the Lord pay the doer of evil according to his wickedness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.1'>And when Sauls son heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his hands became enfeebled, and all the Israelites were troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.2'>And Sauls son had two men who were captains of bands; the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.3'>And the Beerothites had fled to Gittayim, and remained sojourners there until this day.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.4'>And Jonathan, Sauls son, had a son that was lame on both feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan from Yizreel, and his nurse took him up and fled: and it came to pass, in her haste to flee, that he fell, and was rendered lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.5'>And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came at the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who was just lying in bed as usual at noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.6'>And they came thither into the interior of the house, as buyers of wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.7'>Namely, they came into the house, while he was lying on his bed in his sleepingchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and cut off his head, and took his head, and went by the way of the plain all the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.8'>And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and they said to the king, Behold, here is the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thy enemy, who sought thy life: and the Lord hath granted to my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul, and on his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.9'>But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the Lord liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.10'>When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, and he was in his own eyes as though he brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I should give him a reward for his tidings:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.11'>How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous man in his own house upon his bed? and now, behold, I will require his blood of your hand, and I will remove you away from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.12'>And David gave the command to the young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up by the pool in Hebron. But the head of Ishbosheth they took, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.5'>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.1'>And it came to pass, at the return of the same season of the year, at the time when kings go forth, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David remained behind at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.2'>And it happened at eveningtide, that David arose from off his couch, and walked upon the roof of the kings house: and he saw from the roof a woman bathing herself; and the woman was of a very beautiful appearance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.3'>And David sent and inquired after the woman; and some one said, Behold, this is Bethsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriyah the Hittite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.4'>And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her, and she had just purified herself from her uncleanness; and she returned unto her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.5'>And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.6'>And David sent to Joab, Send unto me Uriyah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriyah to David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.7'>And when Uriyah was come unto him, David asked after the wellbeing of Joab, and after the wellbeing of the people, and how the war prospered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.8'>And David said to Uriyah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriyah went forth out of the kings house, and there followed him a mess of food from the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.9'>But Uriyah laid himself down at the door of the kings house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.10'>And they told David, saying, Uriyah is not gone down unto his house: and David said unto Uriyah, Art thou not come from a journey? why then art thou not gone down unto thy own house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.11'>Then said Uriyah unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah abide in booths; and my Lord Joab and the servants of my Lord are encamped in the open field: and should I alone go unto my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.12'>And David said unto Uriyah, Tarry here also this day, and tomorrow will I send thee off. So Uriyah remained in Jerusalem on that day and the following.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.13'>And David invited him, and he ate and drank before him, and he made him drunken; and he went out in the evening to lie down on his restingplace with the servants of his lord; but to his house he did not go down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.14'>And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriyah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.15'>And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriyah in front, opposite to the hottest fight, and then withdraw from behind him, that he may be smitten and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.16'>And it came to pass, when Joab was enclosing the city, that he placed Uriyah toward the spot of which he knew that valiant men were there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.17'>And the men of the city went out and fought with Joab; and there fell some of the people, of the servants of David, and there died also Uriyah the Hittite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.18'>Then did Joab send, and told unto David all the events of the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.19'>And he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast finished telling all the events of the war to the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.20'>And it happen that the kings wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore did you approach unto the city to fight? knew ye not, that they would shoot down from off the wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.21'>Who smote Abimelech the son of Yerubbesheth? did not a woman throw down upon him a piece of an upper millstone from off the wall so that he died at Thebez? why did ye approach unto the wall? then must thou say, Also thy servant Uriyah the Hittite is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.22'>And the messenger went, and came and told unto David all for which Joab had sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.23'>And the messenger said unto David, Because the men overpowered us and came out against us into the field; but we set upon them, as far as the entrance of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.24'>And the archers then shot at thy servants from off the wall; and there died some of the servants of the king, and also thy servant Uriyah the Hittite is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.25'>Then said David to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, Let this thing not be displeasing in thy eyes; for at times this, at other times the other will the sword devour; continue firmly in thy war against the city, and overthrow it: and thus do thou encourage him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.26'>And when the wife of Uriyah heard that Uriyah her husband had died, she mourned for her lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.27'>And when the time of mourning was past, David sent and took her to his house, and she became his wife; and she bore him a son. But the thing which David had done was displeasing in the eyes of the Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.1'>And the Lord sent Nathan unto David, and he came unto him and said to him, Two men were once in one city, the one rich and the other poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.2'>The rich man had flocks and herds, in great abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.3'>But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe, which he had bought; and he nourished it, and it grew up with him and with his children together; of his bread it used to eat, and out of his cup it used to drink, and in his bosom it used to lie, and it was to him as a daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.4'>And there came a traveler unto the rich man; and he felt compunction to take from his own flocks and from his own herds to dress for the wayfarer that was come to him; but he took the ewe of the poor man, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.5'>And the anger of David was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the Lord liveth, surely the man that hath done this deserveth to die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.6'>And the ewe he shall pay fourfold, for punishment that he hath done this thing, and because he had no compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.7'>Then said Nathan to David, Thou art the man! Thus hath said the Lord, the God of Israel, It is I who anointed thee as king over Israel, and it is I who delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.8'>And I gave unto thee the house of thy master, and put the wives of thy master into thy bosom, and gave unto thee the house of Israel and Judah: and if this be too little, I could bestow on thee yet many more like these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.9'>Wherefore hast thou despised the word of the Lord to do what is evil in his eyes? Uriyah the Hittite hast thou smitten with the sword, and his wife hast thou taken unto thee for wife; but him hast thou slain with the sword of the children of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.10'>And now, the sword shall not depart from thy house for ever; for the reason that thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriyah the Hittite to be thy wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.11'>Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will raise up against thee evil out of thy own house, and I will take away thy wives before thy eyes, and I will give them unto thy neighbor; and he shall lie with thy wives before the face of this sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.12'>For thou hast done it in secret; but I will surely do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.13'>Then said David unto Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord. And Nathan said to David, Also the Lord hath caused thy sin to pass away: thou shalt not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.14'>Nevertheless, because thou hast given great cause to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme through this thing, the child also that hath been born unto thee shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.15'>And Nathan went to his house; and the Lord struck the child that Uriyahs wife had born unto David, that it became very sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.16'>And David besought God in behalf of the lad; and David kept a fast, and came home, and lay over night upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.17'>And the elders of the house arose about him, to raise him up from the earth; but he would not, and he did not partake of any bread with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.18'>And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died; and the servants of David were afraid to tell him, that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice: how then shall we say to him, The child is dead! he might do himself a hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.19'>But when David saw that his servants were whispering to each other, David understood that the child was dead; wherefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? and they said, he is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.20'>David then rose up from the earth, and washed and anointed himself, and changed his garments, and went into the house of the Lord and prostrated himself; and then he came to his own house, and asked that they should set food before him, and he ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.21'>And his servants then said unto him, What is this thing which thou hast done? On account of the child when living thou didst fast and weep; but as soon as the child was dead thou didst arise and eat bread!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.22'>And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; because I said, Who knoweth, but that the Lord will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.23'>But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast then? can I restore him again? I am going to him; but he will not return to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.24'>And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and he went in unto her, and lay with her; and she bore a son, and called his name Solomon; and the Lord loved him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.25'>And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and called his name, Yedideyah in behalf of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.26'>And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and captured the royal city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.27'>And Joab sent messengers to David; and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have also captured the watertown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.28'>And now gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and capture it: lest I capture the city myself, and it be called by my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.29'>And David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and captured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.30'>And he took the crown of Malkam from off his head, and its weight was a talent of gold, and on it was a precious stone, and it was set on the head of David; and the booty of the city he brought out in great abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.31'>And the people that were therein he brought forward, and put them under saws, and under iron threshingwagons, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through brickkilns; and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon: and David returned with them with all the people unto Jerusalem.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.1'>And it came to pass after this, that Abshalom the son of David had a handsome sister, whose name was Thamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.2'>And Amnon worried himself so that he fell sick on account of Thamar his sister; for she was a virgin; and it was impossible in the eyes of Amnon to do her the least harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.3'>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Yonadab, the son of Shimah, Davids brother; and Yonadab was a very sensible man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.4'>And he said to him, Why art thou so wasted, O prince, morning after morning? Wilt thou not tell me? Then said Amnon to him, Thamar the sister of Abshalom my brother do I love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.5'>And Yonadab said to him, Lie down on thy couch, and feign thyself sick; and when thy father cometh to see thee, thou must say unto him, Let, I pray thee, Thamar my sister come, and give me some food, and prepare the refreshment before my eyes, in order that I may see it, and eat it out of her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.6'>So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Let, I pray thee, Thamar my sister come, and mix up before my eyes a couple of cakes, that I may enjoy them out of her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.7'>Then did David send home to Thamar, saying, Do go now to thy brother Amnons house, and prepare for him the refreshment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.8'>So Thamar went to the house of Amnon her brother, and he was lying down; and she took the dough and kneaded, and mixed it up before his eyes, and baked the cakes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.9'>And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat; and Amnon said, Cause every man to go out from me; and they went out, every man, from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.10'>And Amnon said to Thamar, Bring the refreshment into the chamber, that I may enjoy it out of thy hand. So Thamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them unto Amnon her brother into the chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.11'>And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come, lie with me, my sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.12'>But she said to him, No, my brother, do not violate me; for such a deed ought not to be done in Israel; do not this scandalous act!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.13'>And I, whither should I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wouldst be like one of the worthless in Israel; but now, O speak, I pray thee, unto the king, for he will not withhold me from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.14'>Nevertheless, he would not hearken unto her voice; but he overpowered her, and violated her, and lay with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.15'>Then did Amnon hate her with a very great hatred; so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her; and Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.16'>And she said unto him, Do not add this yet greater wrong than the other which thou hast done with me, to send me now away! But he would not listen to her;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.17'>And he called his young man, his servant, and said, Do send this woman away from me, into the street, and lock the door behind her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.18'>And she had on a garment of divers colors; for thus were usually appareled the kings daughters when virgins, in robes; and his servant brought her out into the street, and locked the door behind her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.19'>And Thamar put ashes on her head, and the garment of divers colors which was on her she rent: and she placed her hand on her head, and went away and cried as she went along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.20'>Then said to her Abshalom her brother, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now, my sister, keep silence, he is thy brother, take this thing not to thy heart. So Thamar remained, and was secluded in the house of Abshalom her brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.21'>And when king David heard all these things, it displeased him greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.22'>And Abshalom spoke not with Amnon either bad or good; for Abshalom hated Amnon, because he had violated Thamar his sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.23'>And it came to pass after two full years, that Abshalom had sheepshearers at Baalchazor, which is near Ephraim; and Abshalom invited all the kings sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.24'>And Abshalom came to the king, and said, Behold, now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.25'>And the king said to Abshalom, No, my son, do not let us all go now, that we may not be a burden upon thee. And he urged him much, but he would not go, and he blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.26'>And Abshalom said, If not, let, I pray thee, Amnon my brother go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.27'>But Abshalom urged him greatly, and he sent with him Amnon and all the sons of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.28'>Now Abshalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye, I pray you, when Annons heart is merry with wine, and I say unto you, Smite Amnon: then kill him, fear not; behold, it is I who command it you; be firm and show yourselves men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.29'>And the servants of Abshalom did unto Amnon as Abshalom had commanded. Then arose all the kings sons, and they rode off, every man on his mule, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.30'>And it happened, while they were on the way, that the report came to David, saying, Abshalom hath smitten all the kings sons, and there is not one of them left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.31'>Then arose the king and rent his garments, and laid himself on the earth: and all his servants were standing by with their garments rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.32'>But Yonadab the son of Shimah, Davids brother, commenced and said, Let not my Lord suppose that they have slain all the young men, the kings sons; since Amnon alone is dead; for by the command of Abshalom was this ordained from the day that he violated Thamar his sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.33'>And now let not my Lord the king take the thing to his heart, thinking, that all the kings sons are dead; for Amnon alone is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.34'>And Abshalom flew away. And the young man that was watching lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by the way behind him, by the side of the mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.35'>And Yonadab said to the king, The kings sons are come: according to the word of thy servant, so hath it come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.36'>And it happened, as he had just finished speaking, that, behold, the kings sons came, and they lifted up their voice and wept; and also the king and all his servants wept very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.37'>But Abshalom had fled; and he went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur: and David mourned for his son all the time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.38'>So did Abshalom fly, and go to Geshur, and he remained there three years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.39'>And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Abshalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, that he was dead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.14'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.1'>And when now Joab the son of Zeruyah perceived that the heart of the king was turned toward Abshalom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.2'>Then sent Joab to Tekoa, and he fetched thence a wise woman, and said to her, Feign. I pray thee, as though thou mournest, and do put on mourning garments, and anoint thyself not with oil; but be as a woman that hath these many days been mourning for the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.3'>And thou must come to the king and speak with him after these words: and Joab put the words into her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.4'>And the woman from Tekoa spoke to the king, and fell on her face to the ground, and bowed herself, and said, Help, O king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.5'>And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she said, Truly, I am a widowwoman; since my husband is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.6'>And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two quarreled together in the field, and there was no one between them to help either; so the one smote the other, and slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.7'>And, behold, the whole family is risen up against thy handmaid, and they said, Give up the slayer of his brother, that we may have him put to death, for the life of his brother whom he hath killed; and we will destroy also the heir: and thus they will quench my coal which is remaining, so as not to allow to my husband either name or remainder upon the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.8'>And the king said unto the woman, Go to thy house, and I will issue my charge concerning thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.9'>Then said the woman of Tekoa unto the king, On me, my Lord, O king, be the iniquity, and on my fathers house: and may the king and his throne be guiltless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.10'>And the king said, Whosoever speaketh aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.11'>Then said she, Let the king, I pray thee, remember the Lord thy God, so as not to suffer the avenger of the blood to cause yet more destruction, and that they may not destroy my son. And he said, As the Lord liveth, there shall not fall one hair of thy son to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.12'>Then said the woman, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak unto my Lord the king one word. And he said, Speak on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.13'>And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? and since the king doth speak this thing, he is as a guilty man, if the king do not permit his banished one to return home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.14'>For we must needs die, and are as water which is spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; and yet doth God not take away life; and he deviseth thoughts, so that the banished one may not remain banished from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.15'>And now that I am come to speak unto my Lord the king of this thing, happened because the people made me afraid; and therefore thy handmaid said, I will still speak unto the king; perhaps the king may act in accordance with the word of his handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.16'>For the king may hear me, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that desireth to exterminate me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.17'>And thy handmaid said, May the word of my Lord the king now become the means of giving repose; for as an angel of God, so is my Lord the king to comprehend the good and the bad: and may the Lord thy God be with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.18'>Then answered the king and said unto the woman, Conceal not, I pray thee, from me a word concerning what I am going to ask thee. And the woman said, Let my Lord the king but speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.19'>And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my Lord, O king! none can turn to the right or to the left from all that my Lord the king hath spoken; for it was thy servant Joab who hath bidden me, and it was he that hath put in the mouth of thy handmaid all these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.20'>In order to change the appearance of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my Lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all that is done on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.21'>And the king said unto Joab, Behold, now, thou hast done this thing: go then, bring back the young man Abshalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.22'>And Joab fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself, and blessed the king: and Joab said, Today is thy servant convinced that I have found grace in thy eyes, my Lord, O king; since the king hath acted in accordance with the word of thy servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.23'>And Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Abshalom to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.24'>And the king said, Let him repair to his own house, but my face he shall not see. So Abshalom repaired to his own house, but the kings face he did not see.</verse>
