      <chapter osisID='Exod.1'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.1'>Now these are the names of the children of Israel, that came into Egypt with Jacob, every man and his household they came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.2'>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.3'>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.4'>Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.5'>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls; together with Joseph who was already in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.6'>And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.7'>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.8'>Now there rose up a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.9'>And he said unto his people: Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more numerous and mightier than we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.10'>Come, let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there happen to be a war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and depart out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.11'>And they set over taskmasters, to afflict them with their burdensome labors; and they built treasure cities, for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.12'>But in the measure that they afflicted them, so they multiplied and so they spread out; and they felt abhorrence because of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.13'>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to labor with rigor:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.14'>And they made their lives bitter with hard labor, in mortar, and in bricks, and in all manner of labor in the field; in all their service, wherein they made them labor with rigor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.15'>And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.16'>And he said: When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, ye shall look upon the birth; if it be a son, then shall ye kill him; but if it be a daughter, then may she live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.17'>But the midwives feared God, and they did not as the king of Egypt had commanded them, but saved the menchildren alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.18'>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and he said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the menchildren alive?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.19'>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively; ere the midwife cometh in unto them they are delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.20'>And God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.21'>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.22'>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.2'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.1'>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took a daughter of Levi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.2'>And the woman conceived, and bore a son; and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.3'>And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him a box of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it amidst the flags by the brink of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.4'>And his sister placed herself afar off, to ascertain what would be done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.5'>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the side of the river; and when she saw the box among the flags, she sent her maid and fetched it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.6'>And she opened it, and saw the child, and, behold, it was a weeping boy; and she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.7'>Then said his sister to Pharaohs daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse for thee the child?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.8'>And Pharaohs daughter said to her, Go; and the maiden went and called the mother of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.9'>And Pharaohs daughter said unto her, Take away this child, and nurse him for me, and I will give thee thy wages; and the woman took the child, and nursed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.10'>And the child grew up, and she brought him unto Pharaohs daughter, and he became to her as a son; and she called his name Moses; and she said, Because out of the water have I drawn him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.11'>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdensome labors; and he saw an Egyptian man smiting a Hebrew man, one of his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.12'>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one by, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.13'>And when he went out the second day, behold, two Hebrew men were striving together; and he said unto him that was in the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.14'>And he said, Who made thee a chief and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou hast killed the Egyptian! And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is become known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.15'>And Pharaoh heard this thing, and he sought to slay Moses; but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and tarried in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.16'>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their fathers flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.17'>And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses arose and helped them, and watered their flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.18'>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, Wherefore are ye come home so soon today?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.19'>And they said, An Egyptian man delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds; and he also drew water for us, and watered the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.20'>And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? wherefore have ye left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.21'>And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.22'>And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a stranger in a foreign land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.23'>And it came to pass in this long time, that the king of Egypt died; and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried; and their complaint came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.24'>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.25'>And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God took cognizance of them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.3'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.1'>And Moses was keeping the flock of Jithro his fatherinlaw, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock far away into the desert, and came to the mountain of God, to Choreb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.2'>And an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a thornbush; and he looked, and, behold, the thornbush was burning with fire, but the thornbush was not consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.3'>And Moses said, I must turn aside, and see this great sight, why the thornbush is not burnt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.4'>And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the thornbush, and said, Moses, Moses; and he said, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.5'>And he said, Draw not nigh hither; put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.6'>And he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look up to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.7'>And the Lord said, I have truly seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard its cry by reason of its taskmasters; yea, I know its sorrows;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.8'>And I am come down to deliver it out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring it up out of that land unto a land, good and large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Emorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.9'>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.10'>And now then go, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, and thou shalt bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.11'>And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.12'>And he said, Because I will be with thee; and this shall be unto thee the token, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.13'>And Moses said unto God, Behold, if I come unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they then say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.14'>And God said unto Moses, I will be that I will be: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I will be hath sent me unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.15'>And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The Everlasting One, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.16'>Go, and assemble the elders of Israel, and say unto them, The Everlasting One, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath appeared unto me, saying, I have surely taken cognizance of you and of that which is done to you in Egypt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.17'>And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt, unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Emorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.18'>And they will hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The Everlasting One, the God of the Hebrews hath met with us; and now let us go, we beseech thee, a three days journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.19'>But I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, unless it happen through a mighty hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.20'>And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof; and after that he will let you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.21'>And I will give this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians; and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.22'>But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments; and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall empty out Egypt.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.4'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.1'>And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.2'>And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thy hand? and he said, A staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.3'>And he said, Cast it on the ground; and he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.4'>And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thy hand, and grasp it by the tail; and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a staff in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.5'>In order that they may believe that there hath appeared unto thee the Everlasting One, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.6'>And the Lord said farthermore unto him, Do put thy hand into thy bosom: and he put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.7'>And he said, Put thy hand again into thy bosom: and he put his hand again into his bosom; and when he pulled it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.8'>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.9'>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, and will not hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou shalt take out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.10'>And Moses said unto the Lord, Pardon, O Lord, I am not a man of words, neither yesterday, nor the day before, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; for I am heavy of speech, and heavy of tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.11'>And the Lord said unto him, Who hath given a mouth to man? or who maketh him dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? is it not I the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.12'>Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and I will teach thee what thou shalt speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.13'>And he said, Pardon, O Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wouldst send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.14'>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron, thy brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well; and also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee; and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.15'>And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and I will teach you what ye shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.16'>And he shall speak for thee unto the people; and he shall be, yea he shall be to thee as a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as a God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.17'>And this staff shalt thou take in thy hand, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.18'>And Moses went and returned to Jether his fatherinlaw, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren that are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive; and Jithro said to Moses, Go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.19'>And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead who sought thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.20'>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt; and Moses took the staff of God in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.21'>And the Lord said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, regard well all the wonders which I have put in thy hand, and do them before Pharaoh; but I will harden his heart, and he will not let the people go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.22'>And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus hath said the Lord, My son, my firstborn, is Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.23'>And I said unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me; and thou refusest to let him go; so, behold, I will slay thy son, thy firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.24'>And as he was on the journey in the inn, the Lord met him, and sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.25'>Then took Zipporah a sharp instrument, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody relative art thou to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.26'>And then he withdrew from him; when she said, A bloody relative, but only in respect of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.27'>And the Lord said to Aaron, Go to meet Moses, into the wilderness; and he went and met him by the mount of God, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.28'>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord wherewith he had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.29'>And Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the children of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.30'>And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses; and he did the signs before the eyes of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.31'>And the people believed: and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.5'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.1'>And after that Moses and Aaron went in, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus hath said the Everlasting One, the God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.2'>And Pharaoh said, Who is the Everlasting, whose voice I am to obey, to let Israel go? I know not the Everlasting, nor will I let Israel go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.3'>And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, a three days journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the Lord our God; lest he fall upon us with the pestilence, or with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.4'>And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, hinder the people from their works? get you unto your own affairs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.5'>And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye disturb them in the pursuit of their labors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.6'>And Pharaoh commanded on the same day the taskmasters of the people, and its officers, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.7'>Ye shall no more give the people straw to make the bricks, as yesterday and the day before; they themselves shall go and gather themselves straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.8'>And the number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall impose upon them, ye shall not diminish aught thereof; for they are idle: therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.9'>Let the work be made to lie heavily upon the men, that they may have enough to do therein; and that they may not pay attention to false words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.10'>And the taskmasters of the people and its officers went out, and they said to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you any straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.11'>Go ye, get yourselves straw from wherever ye can find it; yet not the least shall be taken off from your work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.12'>And the people scattered themselves abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.13'>And the taskmasters were urgent, saying, Fulfill your works, every day its due portion, just as when there was straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.14'>And the officers of the children of Israel, whom the taskmasters of Pharaoh had set over them, were beaten, as these said, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick as heretofore, both yesterday and today?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.15'>And the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.16'>Straw is not given unto thy servants, and, Make bricks, say they to us: and, behold, thy servants are beaten, and thy people are treated as sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.17'>But he said, Idle are ye, idle; therefore say ye, Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.18'>And now go, work, and straw shall not be given you; yet the required number of bricks shall ye deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.19'>And the officers of the children of Israel saw themselves in the evil necessity to say, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, every day of its task.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.20'>And they met Moses and Aaron, standing in their way, as they came forth from Pharaoh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.10.1'>And the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh; for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, in order that I might display these my signs in the midst of them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.2'>And in order that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy sons son, the wonders which I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have shown among them; and ye shall know now that I am the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.3'>And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the Eternal, the God of the Hebrews, How long yet wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.4'>For, if thou refusest to let my people go, behold, I will bring tomorrow locusts into thy boundary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.5'>And they shall cover the face of the earth, so that one shall not be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which escaped, which hath been left unto you from the hail, and they shall eat off every tree which groweth for you out of the field:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.6'>And thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians shall be full of them; such as neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers fathers have seen, since the day of their being upon the earth, until this day; and he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.7'>And the servants of Pharaoh said unto him, How long shall this man be unto us for a snare? let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.8'>And Moses was brought back with Aaron unto Pharaoh; and he said unto them, Go ye, serve the Lord your God; who all are they that shall go?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.9'>And Moses said, With our young and with our old will we go; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we are to hold a feast unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.10'>And he said unto them, So be the Lord with you, as I will let you go, together with your little ones: look, surely your intentions are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.11'>Not so; go now ye men, and serve the Lord, for this you desire: and they were driven out from Pharaohs presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.12'>And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, and they shall come up over the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the earth, all that the hail hath left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.13'>And Moses stretched forth his staff over the land of Egypt, and the Lord urged an east wind over the land all that day, and all the night; when it was morning, the east wind bore along the locusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.14'>And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the boundaries of Egypt; in very large masses; before them there were no such locusts as they, and after them there will not be any such.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.15'>And they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the earth was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there was not left any green thing on the trees, or on the herbs of the field, throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.16'>Then made Pharaoh haste to call for Moses and Aaron; and he said, I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.17'>And now forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the Lord your God, that he may take away from me only this death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.18'>And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.19'>And the Lord turned a very strong west wind, which bore away the locusts, and cast them into the Red Sea; there was not left one locust in all the boundary of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.20'>But the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart, so that he did not let the children of Israel go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.21'>And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, and there shall be darkness over the land of Egypt, and it shall be a darkness of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.22'>And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.23'>They saw not one another, neither did they rise, any one from his place, for three days; but for all the children of Israel there was light in their dwellings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.24'>And Pharaoh called for Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the Lord; only your flocks and your herds shall remain behind: also your little ones may go with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.25'>And Moses said, Even thou also must give into our hand sacrifices and burntofferings, that we may sacrifice them unto the Eternal, our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.26'>And also our cattle must go with us, there shall not be left behind a single hoof, for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God; and we cannot know with what we must serve the Lord, until we come thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.27'>But the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart, and he would not let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.28'>And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee away from me; take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for on the day thou seest my face thou shalt die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.10.29'>And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will not see thy face again any more.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.11'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.11.1'>And the Lord said unto Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; after that he will let you go hence: when he doth let you go, he shall surely thrust you out altogether from here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.11.2'>Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.11.3'>And the Lord gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians; also the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaohs servants, and in the eyes of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.11.4'>And Moses said, Thus hath said the Lord, About midnight will I go out in the midst of Egypt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.11.5'>And there shall die every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that is to sit upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and every firstborn of cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.11.6'>And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, the like of which hath never been, and the like of which will not be any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.11.7'>But against any of the children of Israel not a dog shall move his tongue, neither against man nor beast; in order that ye may know how that the Lord doth distinguish between the Egyptians and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.11.8'>And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow themselves down unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that followeth thee; and after that I will go out: and he went out from Pharaoh in a burning anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.11.9'>And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; in order that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.11.10'>And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Exod.12'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.1'>And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.2'>This month shall be unto you the chief of months: the first shall it be unto you of the months of the year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.3'>Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, On the tenth day of this month they shall take to themselves every man a lamb for every family, a lamb for every house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.4'>And if the household be too small for a lamb, then shall he take it with his neighbor who is next unto his house, according to the number of the souls; every man according to what he eateth shall ye make a count for the lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.5'>A lamb without blemish, a male of the first year shall ye have; from the sheep, or from the goats may ye take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.6'>And ye shall have it in keeping until the fourteenth day of the same month; and then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it toward evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.7'>And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two sideposts and on the upper doorpost, in the houses, wherein they shall eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.8'>And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted by the fire, with unleavened bread; together with bitter herbs shall they eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.9'>You shall not eat of it raw, nor in any wise sodden with water; but roasted by the fire; its head with its legs, and with its entrails.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.10'>And ye shall not let any thing of it remain until morning; and that which remaineth of it until morning ye shall burn with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.11'>And thus shall ye eat it, With your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste, it is passover unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.12'>And I will pass through the land of Egypt in this night, and I will smite every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt will I execute judgments: I am the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.13'>And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and there shall be no plague against you to destroy, when I smite others in the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.14'>And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall celebrate it as a feast unto the Lord; throughout your generations, as an ordinance for ever shall ye celebrate it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.15'>Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; but on the first day ye shall have put away leaven out of your houses; for whosoever eateth leavened bread, that soul shall be cut off from Israel, from the first day until the seventh day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.16'>And on the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and on the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done on them, save what is eaten by every man, that only may be prepared by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.17'>And ye shall observe the unleavened bread; for on this selfsame day have I brought forth your armies out of the land of Egypt; therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations as an ordinance for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.18'>In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, shall ye eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.19'>Seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses; for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or one born in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.20'>Nothing that is leavened shall ye eat; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.21'>And Moses called for the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take for yourselves lambs according to your families, and kill the passover sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.22'>And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two sideposts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out frown the door of his house until the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.23'>And the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two sideposts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.24'>And ye shall observe this thing, as an ordinance for thee and for thy sons for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.25'>And it shall come to pass, when ye be come into the land which the Lord will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.26'>And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.27'>That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the passover unto the Lord, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and our houses he spared; and the people bent the head and bowed themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.28'>And the children of Israel went away, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.29'>And it came to pass at midnight, that the Lord smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that was to sit on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.30'>And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not some one dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.31'>And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the Eternal, as ye have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.32'>Also your flocks and your herds take, as ye have spoken, and be gone; and bless me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.33'>And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to make haste to send them away out of the land; for they said, We are all dying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.34'>And the people took up their dough before it was yet leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.35'>And the children of Israel had done according to the word of Moses; and they had asked of the Egyptians vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.36'>And the Lord had given the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that they gave unto them what they required; and they emptied out Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.37'>And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, beside children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.38'>And a mixed multitude also went up with them; and flocks, and herds, a very large amount of cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.39'>And they baked of the dough, which they had brought forth out of Egypt, unleavened cakes, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared any provisions for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.40'>Now the time of the residence of the children of Israel, which they dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.41'>And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, and it happened even on the selfsame day, that all the armies of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.42'>A night to be observed was this unto the Lord to bring them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night holy to the Lord, to be observed by all the children of Israel in their generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.43'>And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: No stranger shall eat thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.44'>But every mans servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.45'>A resident foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.46'>In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; and no bone shall ye break in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.47'>All the congregation of Israel shall prepare it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.48'>And when a stranger sojourneth with thee, and will prepare the passover to the Lord, let his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and prepare it, and he shall be as one that is born in the land; but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.49'>One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.50'>And all the children of Israel did so; as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.12.51'>And it came to pass on the selfsame day, that the Lord did bring forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.13.3'>And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, on which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of slavery; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from here: and no leavened bread shall be eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.13.4'>This day go ye out, in the month of Abib.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.13.5'>And it shall be, when the Lord doth bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Emorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he hath sworn unto thy fathers to give unto thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt perform this service in this month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.13.6'>Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day shall be a feast to the Lord.</verse>
