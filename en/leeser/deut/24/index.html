and if she go and become another mans wife;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her away out of his house; or if the latter husband, who took her as his wife, should die:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then shall her former husband, who had sent her away, not be at liberty to take her again to be his wife, after she hath been defiled; for it is abomination before the Lord; and thou shalt not bring sin upon the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any public business: he shall be free for his house one year, and shall cheer up his wife whom he hath taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>No man shall take to pledge the nether or the upper millstone; for he taketh a mans life to pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If a man be found stealing any one of his brethren of the children of Israel, and he treateth him as a slave, and selleth him: then shall that thief die; and thou shalt put the evil away from the midst of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Take heed of the plague of leprosy, to observe diligently, and to do according to all that the priests, the Levites, may instruct you; as I have commanded them, so shall ye observe to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Remember what the Lord thy God did unto Miriam on the journey, at your coming forth out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When thou dost lend thy brother any thing as a loan, thou shalt not go into his house to take his pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In the street shalt thou stand, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out unto thee the pledge into the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if he be a poor man, thou shalt not lie down with his pledge:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou shalt punctually deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may lie under his own cover, and bless thee; and unto thee shall it be as righteousness before the Lord thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shalt not withhold the wages of a hired man, of the poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of the strangers that are in thy land within thy gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>On the same day shalt thou give him his wages, that the sun may not go down upon it; for he is poor, and his soul longeth for it; so that he may not cry against thee unto the Lord, and it be sin in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall children be put to death for the fathers: for his own sin shall every man be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou shalt not pervert the cause of the stranger, or of the fatherless; and thou shalt not take in pledge the raiment of a widow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But thou shalt remember that thou waste a bondman in Egypt, and that the Lord thy God redeemed thee thence; therefore do I command thee to do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When thou cuttest down thy harvest in thy field, and forgettest a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go back to fetch it; for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow shall it be; in order that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When thou beatest thy olivetree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again; for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow shall it be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean the small fruit afterward; for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow shall it be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt; therefore do I command thee to do this thing:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
