And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which said, And now when this letter cometh unto thee, behold, I have sent to thee Naaman my servant, that thou mayest heal him of his leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass, when the king of Israel read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this one doth send unto me to heal a man of his leprosy? for know to a certainty, I pray you, and see that he but seeketh a quarrel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it happened, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him but come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and remained at the door of the house of Elisha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and bathe seven times in the Jordan, and thy flesh shall be restored healthy to thee, and thou shalt become clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Naaman became wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I had thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and swing his hand over the place, and heal the leper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are not Amanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not bathe in them, and become clean? and he turned and went away in a rage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And his servants came near, and spoke unto him, and they said, My father, if the prophet had bidden thee a great thing, wouldst thou not do it? how much rather then, when he hath said to thee, Bathe, and become clean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then went he down, and dived seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God: and his flesh was restored healthy like the flesh of a little boy, and he became clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he returned to the man of God, he with all his camp, and came and stood before him, and said, Behold, now I know that there is no god on all the earth, but in Israel; and now, I pray thee, take a present from thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he said, As the Lord liveth before whom I have stood, I will take none: and he urged him to take it; but he refused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Naaman said, If thou wilt not, then let there be given, I pray thee, unto thy servant two mules burden of earth; for thy servant will not offer henceforth either burntoffering or peacesacrifice unto other gods, except unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For this thing may the Lord pardon thy servant, that when my Lord goeth into the house of Rimmon to prostrate himself there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I prostrate myself also in the house of Rimmon: when I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon, may the Lord pardon thy servant for this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto him, Go in peace: so he departed from him some distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Gechazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman, this Syrian, in not receiving from his hand what he had brought; but, as the Lord liveth, I will run after him, and take some little thing from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Gechazi hurried after Naaman; and when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted doom from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said, all is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from the mountain of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: do give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Naaman said, Give thy assent, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound up two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and he gave them unto his two young men, and they carried them before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he dismissed the men, and they departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gechazi? And he said, Thy servant went not hither or thither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said unto him, My mind was not gone, when the man turned round from his chariot to meet thee. Is it a time to take money, and to take garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>May then the leprosy of Naaman cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
