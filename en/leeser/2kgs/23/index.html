And all the people entered into the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king commanded Chilkiyahu the highpriest, and the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers, to carry forth out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that had been made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of heaven: and they burnt them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried their ashes unto Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had appointed that they might burn incense on the highplaces in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; those also that burnt incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he brought out the Asherah from the house of the Lord, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burnt it at the brook Kidron, and ground it small to powder, and cast its powder upon the graves of the children of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he pulled down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the highplaces where the priests had burnt incense, from Geba to BeerSheba, and he pulled down the highplaces of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a mans left at the gate of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nevertheless the priests of the highplaces came not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem; but they ate unleavened bread in the midst of their brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he defiled the Thopheth, which was in the valley Benhinnom, so that no man should cause his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he put down the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, from the entrance of the house of the Lord, by the chamber of Nethanmelech the chamberlain, who was over the suburbs; and the chariots of the sun he burnt with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the altars that were on the roof of the upperchamber of Achaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Menasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord, did the king pull down, and tore them away from there, and cast their dust into the brook Kidron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the highplaces that were before Jerusalem, which were to the right of the mount of destruction, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Kemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he broke in pieces the standing images, and cut down the Asherahgroves, and filled their places with the bones of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So also the altar that was at Bethel, the highplace which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who induced Israel to sin, had made,also that altar and the highplace did he pull down; and he burnt the highplace, ground it small to powder, and burnt then the Asherah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Josiah turned about, and beheld the graves that were there in the mount, and he sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burnt them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the Lord which the man of God proclaimed, who had proclaimed these events.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said he, What kind of monument is that which I see? And the men of the city said to him, It is the grave of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things which thou hast done against the altar of Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Let him rest: no man shall disturb his bones. So they saved his bones, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And also all the houses of the highplaces that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made as provocations to anger, did Josiah remove, and did to them in accordance with all the acts that he had done in Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he slaughtered all the priests of the highplaces that were there upon the altars, and burnt mens bones upon them, and returned then to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the Lord your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there had not been holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel; nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Judah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this passover holden to the Lord in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And also the men of familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were to be seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah clear away; in order that he might accomplish the words of the law which were written in the book that Chilkiyahu the priest had found in the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And like unto him there was no king before him, that returned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; and after him there arose none like him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Notwithstanding this the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great anger, since his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provokings wherewith Menasseh had provoked him to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the Lord said, Also Judah will I remove out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In his days went up Pharaohnechoh the king of Egypt against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he saw him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And his servants carried him dying in a chariot from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoachaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his fathers stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Twenty and three years old was Jehoachaz when he became king; and three months did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mothers name was Chamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, all just as his fathers had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Pharaohnechoh put him in fetters at Riblah in the land of Chamath, that he should not reign in Jerusalem, and imposed a fine on the land of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Pharaohnechoh made Elyakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoyakim, and took Jehoachaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jehoyakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money by the order of Pharaoh: from every one according to his estimation did he exact the silver and gold from the people of the land, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Twenty and five years old was Jehoyakim when he became king; and eleven years did be reign in Jerusalem. And his mothers name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedayah of Rumah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, all just as his fathers had done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
