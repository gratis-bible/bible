I had in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and for the footstool of our God, and I had made preparations to build;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build a house unto my name; because thou art a man of war, and blood hast thou shed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet the Lord the God of Israel made choice of me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever; for of Judah had he made choice as ruler, and among the house of Judah, of the house of my father; and among the sons of my father had he pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And of all my sons,for the Lord hath given me many sons, hath he made choice of Solomon my son, to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he hath said unto me, Solomon thy son it is that shall build my house and my courts; for I have made choice of him to be as a son unto me, and I will be indeed to him as a father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Moreover, I will firmly establish his kingdom for everlasting, if he be strong to execute my commandments and my ordinances as it is this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And now before the eyes of all Israel, the congregation of the Lord, and in the hearing of our God, I admonish you observe and seek for all the commandments of the Lord your God: in order that ye may keep possession of this good land, and leave it for an inheritance unto your children after you forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with an entire heart and with a willing soul; for all hearts doth the Lord search, and every imagination of the thoughts doth he understand; if thou seek him, he will let himself be found by thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>See now that the Lord hath made choice of thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong and do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then gave David to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of its apartments, and of its treasuries, and of upper chambers, and of its inner chambers, and of the place of the cover of the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the pattern of all that he had in his spirit, concerning the courts of the house of the Lord, and concerning all the chambers round about, concerning the treasuries of the house of God, and concerning the treasuries of the holy things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Also concerning the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and concerning all the work of the service of the house of the Lord, and concerning all the vessels of service of the house of the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Concerning the golden vessels, after the weight of the gold, for all the vessels of all manner of service;
