      <chapter osisID='1Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>And there was a certain man of Ramathayimzophim, of the mountain of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah, the son of Yerocham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tochu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>And this man went up out of his city from year to year to prostrate himself and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh. And at that place were the two sons of Eli, Chophni and Phinehas, priests of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>And when the day was come that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>But unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for Hannah he loved greatly; but the Lord had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>And her rival also provoked her continually, in order to make her fret; because the Lord had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>And he did so year by year, as often as she went up to the house of the Lord, so did she provoke her; wherefore she wept, and did not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>Then said to her Elkanah her husband, Hannah, why wilt thou weep? and why wilt thou not eat? and why should thy heart be grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>And Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk; and Eli the priest was sitting upon a chair by the doorpost of the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>But she had bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord, and wept greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a manchild: then will I give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>And it came to pass, as she continued praying long before the Lord, that Eli watched her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>Now as for Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard; wherefore Eli regarded her as a drunken woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from off thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>And Hannah answered and said, No, my Lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit; but neither wine nor strong drink have I drunk, and I have poured out my soul before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>Esteem not thy handmaid as a worthless woman; for out of the abundance of my grief and vexation have I spoken hitherto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant thy petition which thou hast asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy eyes. The woman then went on her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no longer as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>And they rose up early in the morning, and prostrated themselves before the Lord, and returned, and came to their house at Ramah; and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>And it came to pass, after the lapse of some time, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she called his name Samuel, saying, Because from the Lord have I asked him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>And the man Elkanah went up, with all his house, to offer unto the Lord the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>But Hannah did not go up; for she said unto her husband, So soon as the child shall be weaned, then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord, and abide there for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth good in thy eyes; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only may the Lord fulfill his word. So the woman remained behind, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>And she took him up with her, when she had weaned him, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and she brought him unto the house of the Lord at Shiloh; although the child was yet young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>And she said, Pardon, my Lord, as thy soul liveth, my Lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, to pray unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>For this lad did I pray; and the Lord hath granted me my petition which I asked of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>Therefore also have I lent him, for my part, to the Lord; all the days that have been assigned to him shall he be lent to the Lord. And he bowed himself there before the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart is glad in the Lord, my horn is exalted through the Lord: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>There is none holy like the Lord; for there is none beside thee; and there is not any rock like our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come out of your mouth; for a God of knowledge is the Lord, and by him are actions weighed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>The bow of the mighty is broken, and those that stumbled are girded with strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>They that were full hire themselves out for bread; and they that were hungry cease from labor: while the barren hath born seven, she that hath many children fadeth away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich: he bringeth low and also lifteth up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>He raiseth up out of the dust the poor, from the dunghill he lifteth up the needy, to set them among nobles, and he assigneth them the throne of glory; for the Lords are the pillars of the earth, on which he hath set the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>He ever guardeth the feet of his pious ones, and the wicked shall be made silent in darkness; for not by strength can man prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>The Lordhis adversaries will be crushed; out of heaven will he thunder upon them: the Lord will judge the ends of the earth; and he will give strength unto his king, and lift up the horn of his anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the lad was ministering unto the Lord before Eli the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>And the sons of Eli were worthless men: they knew not the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered a sacrifice, the priests servant came, while the man was seething the flesh, with a fork with three teeth in his hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>And he struck it into the pan, or the kettle, or the caldron, or the pot; and all that the fork brought up the priest took away with it. So did they unto all the Israelites that came thither, to Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>Even before they had yet burnt the fat, the priests servant would come, and say to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not take from thee sodden flesh, but raw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>And if the man said unto him, They will surely presently burn the fat, and then take whatever thy soul may long for: then would he say, No; but thou shalt give it me now; and if not, I will take it by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>And the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord; for the men despised the offering of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>But Samuel was ministering before the Lord, being a lad, girded with a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>Moreover his mother used to make him a little overcoat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, May the Lord give thee seed from this woman instead of the loan who is lent to the Lord. And they went back unto his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>And truly the Lord visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the lad Samuel grew up before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons were in the habit of doing unto all Israel; and how they would lie with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>And he said unto them, Why will ye do such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>No, my sons; for the report that I hear is not good, which the Lords people spread abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him; but if against the Lord a man should sin, who shall pray for him? Nevertheless would they not hearken unto the voice of their father, because the Lord desired to slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>And the lad Samuel was constantly growing and increasing in favor both with the Lord, and also with men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus hath said the Lord, Did I not appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt, in Pharaohs house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>And did I not choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to me as a priest, to offer upon my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I not give unto the house of thy father all the fireofferings of the children of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at my meatoffering, which I have commanded in my habitation? and why honoredst thou thy sons above me, to fatten yourselves with the first of every offering of Israel my people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>Therefore saith the Lord the God of Israel, I had indeed said, Thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever; but now, saith the Lord, Be it far from me; for those that honor me will I honor, and those that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Behold, days are coming, that I will hew off thy arm, and the arm of thy fathers house, so that there shall not be an old man in thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>And thou shalt behold a rival in my habitation, in all that by which he will do good for Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thy house in all times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>And yet I will not cut off the men descended from thee from my altar, to consume thy eyes, and to grieve thy soul: and all the increase of thy house shall die as vigorous men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>And this shall be unto thee the sign, that shall happen on thy two sons, on Chophni and Phinehas: On one day shall they, both of them, die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>And I will raise up to me a faithful priest, who shall do in accordance with what is in my heart and in my mind; and I will build for him an enduring house; and he shall walk before my anointed in all times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>And it shall come to pass, that whoever is left in thy house shall come to bow down to him for a gera of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Attach me, I pray thee, unto one of the priestly offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>And the lad Samuel was ministering unto the Lord before Eli. And the word of the Lord was scarce in those days: prophecy was not extended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.2'>And it came to pass one day, when Eli was lying down in his place, and his eyes had begun to grow dim, he could not see;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.3'>And the lamp of God had not yet gone out, while Samuel was lying down in the hall of the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.4'>That the Lord called Samuel: and he said, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.5'>And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he said, I did not call: lie down again. And he went and lay down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.6'>And the Lord continued to call again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I did not call, my son: lie down again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.7'>And Samuel knew not yet the Lord, nor had the word of the Lord been as yet revealed unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.8'>And the Lord continued to call, Samuel, the third time; and he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli then perceived that the Lord was calling the lad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.9'>And Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth. And Samuel went and lay down in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.10'>And the Lord came, and placed himself, and called as at previous times, Samuel, Samuel. And Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.11'>And the Lord said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.12'>On that day will I fulfill on Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house: I will begin and finish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.13'>And I tell him that I will judge his house for ever; for the iniquity that he knew that his sons were drawing a curse on themselves, and he restrained them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.14'>And therefore have I sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Elis house shall not be atoned for with sacrifice or meatoffering for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.15'>And Samuel lay until the morning, when he opened the doors of the house of the Lord; and Samuel feared to tell the vision unto Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.16'>But Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.17'>And he said, What is the word which he hath spoken unto thee? do not, I pray thee, conceal it from me: may God do to thee thus, and continue to do so, if thou conceal any thing from me of all the word that he hath spoken unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.18'>And Samuel told him all the words, and concealed nothing from him. And he said, He is the Lord: let him do what seemeth good in his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.19'>And Samuel grew up, and the Lord was with him, and he did not let fall any one of all his words to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.20'>And thus knew all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba that Samuel was accredited as a prophet of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.21'>And the Lord continued to appear in Shiloh; for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.1'>And the word of Samuel became known to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenhaezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.2'>And the Philistines put themselves in battlearray against Israel; and the battle became general, and Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew on the battleground, in the field, about four thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.3'>And when the people were come back into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us this day before the Philistines? Let us bring over to us out of Shiloh the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that it may come in the midst of us, and deliver us out of the hand of our enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.4'>So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought away from there the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, who dwelleth over the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Chophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.5'>And it happened when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, that all Israel set up a great shout, so that the earth trembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.6'>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.7'>And the Philistines were afraid; for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for the like of this hath not been, yesterday or the day before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.8'>Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.9'>Be strong, and act like men, O Philistines, so that ye become not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been servants to you: therefore act like men, and fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.10'>And the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were smitten, and they fled every man unto his tent: and the defeat was very great; and there fell of Israel thirty thousand men on foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.11'>And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Chophni and Phinehas, died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.12'>And there ran a man of Benjamin from the battlefield, and came to Shiloh on the same day, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.13'>And when he came, lo, Eli was sitting upon a chair by the wayside watching; for his heart was anxious for the ark of God. And when the man came to tell it in the city, all the city cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.14'>And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this multitude? And the man came in hastily, and told it to Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.15'>Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were fixed, so that he could not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.16'>And the man said unto Eli, I am the person that came from the battlefield, and I myself fled from the battlefield today. And he said, What was it that took place, my son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.17'>And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath also been a great slaughter among the people, and also thy two sons, Chophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God hath been taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.18'>And it came to pass, when he mentioned the ark of God, that he fell from off the chair backward by the side of the gate, and his neck was broken, and he died; for the man was old, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.19'>And his daughterinlaw, the wife of Phinehas, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings concerning that the ark of God had been taken, and that her fatherinlaw and her husband were dead, she sank down and gave birth; for her pains came suddenly upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.20'>And at the moment of her dying, the women that stood around her spoke unto her, Fear not; for a son hast thou born. But she answered not, nor did she take it to heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.21'>And she named the child Ichabod, saying, Glory is departed from Israel; because of the taking away of the ark of God, and because of her fatherinlaw and her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.22'>And she said, Glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God hath been taken away.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.1'>And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenhaezer unto Ashdod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.2'>And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.3'>And when the people of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was lying upon his face on the earth before the ark of the Lord. And they took Dagon, and set him again in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.4'>And when they arose early on the morning of the following day, behold, Dagon was lying upon his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the fish portion was left on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.5'>Therefore do the priests of Dagon, and all that come into Dagons house, not step on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod even until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.6'>And the hand of the Lord became heavy upon the people of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with hemorrhoids, even Ashdod and its territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.7'>And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not remain with us; for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.1'>Then came up Nachash the Ammonite, and encamped against Yabeshgilad: and all the men of Yabesh said unto Nachash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.2'>And Nachash the Ammonite said unto them, On this condition will I make it with you, that ye all have put out the right eye, that I may lay it as a reproach upon all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.3'>And the elders of Yabesh said unto him, Grant us seven days respite, that we may send messengers throughout all the boundary of Israel; and then, if there be none to save us, will we come out to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.4'>And the messengers came to Gibah of Saul, and spoke the words in the ears of the people; and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.5'>And, behold, Saul was coming after the herds out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the words of the men of Yabesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.6'>And the spirit of God came suddenly over Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was kindled greatly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.7'>And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them about throughout all the boundary of Israel by the hand of the messengers, saying, Whosoever goeth not forth after Saul and after Samuel, shall have his herds thus treated. And the dread of the Lord fell on the people, and they went out as one man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.8'>And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.9'>And they said unto the messengers that were come, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Yabeshgilad, Tomorrow shall ye have help, when the sun shineth hot. And the messengers came and told it to the men of Yabesh; and these were glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.10'>And the men of Yabesh said, Tomorrow will we go out unto you, and ye can do unto us in accordance with all that seemeth good in your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.11'>And it happened on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and they smote the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that those that remained were scattered, and no two among them were left together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.12'>And the people said unto Samuel, Who is there that saith, Shall Saul reign over us? give up the men, and we will put them to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.13'>And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death on this day; for today the Lord hath wrought deliverance in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.14'>And Samuel said to the people, Come and let us go to Gilgal, and renew there the choice of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.15'>And all the people went to Gilgal; and they appointed there Saul as king before the Lord in Gilgal; and they sacrificed there sacrifices of peaceofferings before the Lord; and Saul with all the men of Israel rejoiced there very greatly.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.12'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.1'>And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and I have set a king over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.2'>And now, behold, the king is walking before you; and I am old and grayheaded; and my sons, behold, they are with you; and I have walked before you from my youth even until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.3'>Behold, here am I; testify against me in the presence of the Lord, and in the presence of his anointed: Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or from whose hand have I received any ransom so that I withdrew my eyes from him? and I will restore it you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.4'>And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor hast thou oppressed us, and thou hast not taken from any mans hand the least.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.5'>And he said unto them, The Lord is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found in my hand the least: and they answered, He is witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.6'>And Samuel said unto the people, It is the Lord who did wonders through Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.7'>And now stand up, that I may hold judgment with you before the Lord concerning all the benefits of the Lord, which he hath done to you and to your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.8'>When Jacob was come into Egypt, then did your fathers cry unto the Lord, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, and they brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and caused them to dwell in this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.9'>And when they forgot the Lord their God, he sold them into the hand of Sissera, the chief of the host of Chazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they made war against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.10'>And they cried then unto the Lord, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the Lord, and have served the Bealim and the Ashtaroth; and now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.11'>And the Lord sent Yerubbaal, and Bedan, and Yiphthach, and Samuel, and he delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, so that ye dwelt safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.12'>But when ye saw that Nachash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, No; but a king shall reign over us: when the Lord your God is your king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.13'>And now here is the king whom ye have chosen, whom ye have asked for! and, behold, the Lord hath set over you a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.14'>If ye will fear the Lord, and serve him, and obey his voice, and will not rebel against the will of the Lord: then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.15'>But if ye will not hearken to the voice of the Lord, and rebel against the will of the Lord: then will the hand of the Lord be against you, as it was against your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.16'>And now stand up and see this great thing, which the Lord is about doing before your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.17'>Is there not wheatharvest today? I will call unto the Lord, and he will send thunders and rain; and ye will thus perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done, in the eyes of the Lord, to ask for yourselves a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.18'>And Samuel called unto the Lord; and the Lord sent thunders and rain on that day: and all the people feared greatly the Lord and Samuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.19'>And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray in behalf of thy servants unto the Lord thy God, that we may not die; for we have added unto all our sins yet this evil, to ask for ourselves a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.20'>And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not; ye have indeed done all this evil: yet turn not aside from following the Lord, and serve ye the Lord with all your heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.21'>And turn ye not aside; for then would ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; because they are vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.22'>For the Lord will not forsake his people for the sake of his great name; because it hath pleased the Lord to make you a people unto himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.23'>Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray in behalf of you; but I will teach you the good and the right way:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.24'>Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for see what great things he hath done with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.25'>But if ye will in any wise do wickedly, both ye yourselves as also your king shall perish.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.1'>When Saul had reigned one year,and two years he reigned over Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.2'>Saul chose for himself three thousand men out of Israel; and there were with Saul two thousand in Michmash and on the mountain of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent away every man to his tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.3'>And Jonathan smote the outpost of the Philistines that was at Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the cornet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.4'>And all Israel heard it, saying, Saul hath smitten the outpost of the Philistines, and the Israelites also have put themselves in illfavor with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.5'>And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude; and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.6'>And when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, for the people were oppressed, then did the people hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in strongholds, and in pits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.7'>And some of the Hebrews passed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilad. As for Saul, he was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him hastily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.8'>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed; but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattering themselves from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.9'>And Saul said, Bring hither to me the burntoffering and the peaceofferings. And he offered the burntoffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.10'>And it came to pass, that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burntoffering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.11'>And Samuel said, What hast thou done: And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattering themselves from me, whereas thou camest not at the appointed day, and the Philistines are gathering themselves together at Michmash;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.12'>And I said, The Philistines will now come down unto me to Gilgal, and I have not yet made supplication unto the Lord: wherefore I forced myself, and offered the burntoffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.13'>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he had commanded thee; for now would the Lord have established thy government over Israel for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.14'>But now thy government shall not endure: the Lord hath sought out for himself a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath ordained him to be chief over his people; because thou hast not kept what the Lord had commanded thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.15'>And Samuel arose, and went up from Gilgal unto Gibah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were to be found with him, about six hundred men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.16'>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were to be found with them, were lying in Geba of Benjamin; but the Philistines were encamped in Michmash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.17'>And the troop of freebooters went out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned into the way to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.18'>And another company turned into the way to Bethchoron; and the other company turned into the way to the frontier that looketh over the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.19'>Now there was no smith to be found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, So that the Hebrews shall not make themselves swords or spears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.20'>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his ploughshare, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.21'>And they used a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the threepronged forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.22'>So it came to pass on the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan; but they were found with Saul and with Jonathan his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.23'>And the outpost of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.1'>Now it happened one day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines outpost, that is on the other side yonder. But unto his father he told nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.2'>And Saul tarried in the lower part of Gibah under the pomegranate tree which is by Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.3'>And Achiyah, the son of Achitub, the brother of Ichabod, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the Lord in Shiloh, wore the ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.4'>And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the outpost of the Philistines, there was a sharp point of rock on the one side, and a sharp point of rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.5'>The one point rose up abruptly northward opposite Michmash, and the other southward opposite Geba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.6'>And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over unto the outpost of these uncircumcised: it may be that the Lord will work for us; for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by means of many or by means of few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.7'>And his armorbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thy heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.8'>Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will show ourselves unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.9'>If they say thus unto us, Stand still until we come to you: then will we remain standing in our places, and will not go up unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.10'>But if they say thus, Come up unto us: then will we go up; for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand; and this shall be unto us the sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.11'>And when both of them showed themselves unto the outpost of the Philistines, the Philistines said, Behold, Hebrews are coming forth out of the holes wherein they have hidden themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.12'>And the men of the outpost addressed Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will let you know something. Then said Jonathan unto his armorbearer, Come up after me; for the Lord hath given them up into the hand of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.13'>And Jonathan then ascended upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armorbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan, and his armorbearer was killing after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.14'>And that first defeat, which Jonathan and his armorbearer caused, was about twenty men, within about the half of a field, which a yoke of oxen might plough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.15'>And there arose a terror in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the outposts, and the freebooters, they also were terrified, and the earth quaked; and it became a very great terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.16'>And the watchers of Saul in Gibah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude became scattered, and ran hither and thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.17'>Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Muster now, and see who is gone away from us. And they mustered, and, behold, there was neither Jonathan nor his armorbearer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.18'>And Saul said unto Achiyah, Bring hither the ark of God; for the ark of God was on that day with the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.19'>And it happened, while Saul was speaking unto the priest, that the confusion which was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased more and more: And Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.20'>And Saul and all the people that were with him were called together, and they came to the battle; and, behold, the sword of every man was against his fellow, the disorder being very great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.21'>And the Hebrews that were with the Philistines as before that time, those namely who had gone up with them, were in the camp round about; but these also resolved to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.22'>And all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves on the mountain of Ephraim, heard that the Philistines had fled; and they also followed hard after them in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.23'>So the Lord saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.24'>And the men of Israel were hard urged that day; and Saul adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that will eat food until the evening, until I have been avenged on my enemies. And the whole people tasted thus no food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.25'>And the men of all the land came to a forest; and there was honey upon the surface of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.26'>And when the people were come into the forest, behold, there was a stream of honey; but no one put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.27'>But Jonathan had not heard his father charging the people with the oath; he therefore put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and dipped it in a honeycomb, and carried his hand again to his mouth; and his eyes became clear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.28'>Then commenced one of the people, and said, Thy father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that will eat food this day; though the people were faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.29'>Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how my eyes become clear, because I have tasted a little of this honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.30'>How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely this day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for would there not have been now a greater defeat among the Philistines?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.31'>And they smote on that day among the Philistines from Michmash to Ayalon; and the people were very faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.32'>And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and young steers, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat upon the blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.33'>And they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people are sinning against the Lord, in eating upon the blood. And he then said, Ye have acted treacherously: roll hither unto me this day a great stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.34'>And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring near unto me every man his ox, and every man his lamb, and slaughter here, and eat; and sin not against the Lord in eating by the blood. And all the people brought near every man his ox by his hand that night, and slaughtered them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.35'>And Saul built an altar unto the Lord: the same was the first altar that he built unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.36'>And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morninglight, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good in thy eyes. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.37'>And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not on that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.38'>And Saul said, Draw ye near hither all the chief of the people: and know and see through what this sin hath happened this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.39'>For, as the Lord liveth, who saveth Israel, that if it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But no one answered him among all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.40'>Then said he unto all Israel, Ye shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good in thy eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.41'>And Saul said unto the Lord, God of Israel, O, show forth the perfect truth. And Jonathan and Saul were seized; but the people came forth free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.42'>And Saul said, Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was seized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.43'>Then said Saul to Jonathan, Do tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste with the end of the staff that was in my hand a little honey: lo, I am willing to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.44'>And Saul said, May God do thus now, and in future also; for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.45'>And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? This shall not be: as the Lord liveth, there shall not fall one hair of his head to the ground; for with God hath he wrought this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, and he died not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.46'>Then went Saul up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.47'>So Saul strengthened himself in the government over Israel; and he fought on every side against all his enemies, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he caused terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.48'>And he gathered an army, and he smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those that spoiled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.49'>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Yishvi, and Malkishua: and the names of his two daughtersthe name of the firstborn was Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.50'>And the name of Sauls wife was Achinoam, the daughter of Achimaaz: and the name of the captain of his army was Abner, the son of Ner, Sauls uncle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.51'>And Kish the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner, were each the son of Abiel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.52'>And the war against the Philistines was violent all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto himself.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.1'>And Samuel said unto Saul, Me did the Lord send to anoint thee as king over his people, over Israel; and now hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.2'>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, I remember what Amalek did to Israel, how he lay in wait for him on the way, when he came up from Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.3'>Now go and smite Amalek, and devote all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and lamb, camel and ass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.4'>And Saul ordered the people to assemble, and he numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand men on foot, and ten thousand of the men of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.5'>And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and he fought in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.6'>And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from the midst of the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; whereas ye acted kindly with all the children of Israel, at their coming up out of Egypt. And the Kenites departed from the midst of the Amalekites.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.2'>And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father is not wont to do a great thing or a small thing, which he doth not inform me of; and why should my father conceal this thing from me? it is not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.3'>But David swore again, and said, Thy father well knoweth that I have found grace in thy eyes; wherefore he said, Jonathan must not know this, lest he be grieved: nevertheless, as truly as the Lord liveth, and thy soul liveth, there was but one step between me and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.4'>Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul sayeth will I do for thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.11'>And Jonathan said unto David, Come, let us go out into the field. And they went out, both of them, into the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.12'>And Jonathan said unto David, May the God of Israel punish me if, when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow, or of the third day, and, behold, if he be good toward David, I do not then send unto thee, and inform thee of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.13'>May the Lord do so to Jonathan and continue so yet farther, that, if it please my father to do thee evil, I will inform thee of it, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace; and may the Lord be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.14'>And wilt thou not, should I be yet alive, show me the kindness of the Lord, that I may not die?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.18'>Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow is the newmoon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be left empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.19'>And when thou hast stayed till the third day, then shalt thou go down greatly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself on the workday; and thou shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.20'>And I will myself shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I were shooting at a mark.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.25'>And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, upon the seat by the wall: and when Jonathan arose, Abner seated himself by the side of Saul, and Davids place was left empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.26'>Nevertheless Saul spoke not the least on that day; for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; because he hath not yet purified himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.27'>And it came to pass on the morrow, the second day of the newmoon, that Davids place was left empty; and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore is the son of Jesse not come, both yesterday and today, to the repast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.28'>And Jonathan answered Saul, David asked earnestly leave of me to go as far as Bethlechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.29'>And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for we have a familysacrifice in the city, and my brother himself hath commanded it to me; and now, if I have found favor in thy eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, that I may see my brothers: therefore is he not come unto the kings table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.30'>And the anger of Saul was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of perverse rebelliousness! do I not know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thy own shame, and to the shame of thy mothers nakedness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.31'>For all the days that the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou wilt not have any permanence with thy kingdom: therefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.32'>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be put to death? what hath he done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.33'>And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him: and Jonathan understood that it was determined on by his father to put David to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.34'>And Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food on the second day of the newmoon; for he was grieved for David; because his father had made him feel ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.35'>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field to the place appointed with David, and a little lad was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.36'>And he said unto his lad, Run, do find out the arrows which I shoot: and the lad ran, and he shot the arrow so as to pass beyond him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.37'>And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the lad, and said, Behold, the arrow is beyond thee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.38'>And Jonathan called after the lad, Make haste, speed, stay not: and Jonathans lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.41'>And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose from the south side of the stone, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.42'>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace: what we have sworn, both of us, in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever, shall be kept. <note>(21:1)</note> And he arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.2'>Thereupon David asked counsel of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and smite among these Philistines? And the Lord said unto David, Go and smite among the Philistines, and deliver Keilah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.3'>And Davids men said unto him, Behold, here in Judah are we afraid: how much more then if we should go to Keilah against the battlearrays of the Philistines?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.4'>Then David asked yet again counsel of the Lord. And the Lord answered him and said, Arise, Go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.5'>So David and his men went to Keilah; and he fought with the Philistines, and lead away their cattle, and smote among them a great slaughter. So David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.6'>And it came to pass, when Ebyathar the son of Achimelech, fled over to David, to Keilah, that the ephod came down with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.7'>And it was told to Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.8'>And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.9'>And David understood that Saul secretly devised mischief against him; and he said to Ebyathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.10'>Then said David, O Lord, God of Israel, thy servant hath heard for certain that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.11'>Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? will Saul come down as thy servant hath heard? O Lord, God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the Lord said, He will come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.12'>Then said David, Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul! And the Lord said, They will surrender.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.13'>Then arose David and his men, about six hundred men, and departed out of Keilah, and wandered about whithersoever they could go. And when it was told to Saul that David was escaped from Keilah, he forbore to go forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.14'>And David remained in the wilderness in strongholds, and abode on the mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him all the time, but God delivered him not into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.15'>And David saw that Saul was gone forth to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the forest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.16'>And Jonathan, the son of Saul, arose and went to David into the forest, and strengthened his hand in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.17'>And he said unto him, Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father will not find thee; and thou wilt be king over Israel, and I will be next unto thee; and also Saul my father knoweth this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.18'>And they made, both of them, a covenant before the Lord: and David remained in the forest; but Jonathan went to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.19'>Then came up the Ziphites unto Saul to Gibah, saying, Behold, David is hiding himself with us in the strongholds in the forest, on the hill of Chachilah, which is on the right of the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.20'>And now in accordance with all the longing of thy soul, O king, to come down, come down; and our part shall be to surrender him into the kings hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.21'>And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the Lord; for ye have pity on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.22'>Go, I pray you, make yet more preparations, and remark and see his place where his foot may be, who hath seen him there; for I am told that he dealeth with great subtilty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.23'>See therefore, and remark every one of all the lurkingplaces where he usually hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you; and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.24'>And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul; but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the right of the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.25'>And Saul and his men went to make a search. And they told it to David: wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard this, he pursued after David into the wilderness of Maon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.26'>And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain; and David made haste to get away from before Saul; and Saul and his men were compassing David and his men to seize them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.27'>But a messenger came unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.28'>Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammachlekoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.29'>And David went up from there, and dwelt in strongholds of Engedi.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.24'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.1'>And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from pursuing the Philistines, that it was told to him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.2'>Then took Saul three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.3'>And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, and there was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men were sitting in the lower end of the cave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.4'>And the men of David said unto him, Behold, this is the day of which the Lord hath said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thy enemy into thy hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good in thy eyes. And David arose, and cut off the corner of the robe which Saul wore, unperceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.5'>And it came to pass afterward, that Davids heart smote him, because he had cut off the corner of Sauls robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.6'>And he said unto his men, Far be it from me for the Lords sake, that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lords anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him; because he is the anointed of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.7'>So David restrained his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.8'>David also arose afterward, and went forth out of the cave, and called after Saul, saying, My Lord, the king! And Saul then looked behind him, and David bowed his face to the earth, and prostrated himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.9'>And David said to Saul, Wherefore wilt thou listen to mens words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy injury?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.10'>Behold, this day thy eyes have seen how that the Lord had delivered thee today into my hand in the cave, and some one said that I should kill thee: but my soul felt compassion for thee: and I said, I will not stretch forth my hand against my Lord; because he is the anointed of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.11'>And now, my father, see, yea, see the corner of thy robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the corner of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and that I have not sinned against thee: yet thou liest in wait for my soul to take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.12'>May the Lord judge between me and thee, and may the Lord avenge me on thee; but my hand shall not be against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.13'>As saith the proverb of the ancients, From the wicked proceedeth wickedness; but my hand shall not be against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.14'>After whom is the king of Israel gone out? after whom art thou pursuing? after a dead dog, after a single flea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.15'>May the Lord therefore be judge, and decide between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and obtain me justice out of thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.16'>And it came to pass, When David had finished speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.17'>And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast done for me only what is good, whereas I have rewarded thee only with what is evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.18'>And thou hast proved this day, that thou hast dealt well with me; forasmuch as when the Lord had surrendered me into thy hand, thou didst not kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.19'>For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go away on a good road? so may the Lord reward thee with good for what thou hast done unto me this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.20'>And now, behold, I know that thou wilt surely become king, and that the kingdom of Israel will stand firmly in thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.21'>And now swear unto me by the Lord, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my fathers house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.22'>And David swore unto Saul; and Saul went to his house; but David and his men went up into the stronghold.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.25'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.1'>And Samuel died; and all the Israelites assembled themselves together, and lamented for him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.2'>And there was a man in Maon, whose business was in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was, while they were shearing his sheep, at Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.3'>Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigayil: and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful form; but the man was hardhearted and evil in his deeds; and he was of the house of Caleb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.4'>And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.5'>And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and ask him in my name after his wellbeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.6'>And ye shall say, May it thus be throughout thy life; and peace be to thee, and peace be to thy house, and unto all that thou hast be peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.7'>And now have I heard that thou hast sheepshearers: now thy shepherds have been with us, we have not injured them, neither hath there aught been missing unto them, all the time they were at Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.8'>Ask thy young men, and they will tell it thee. Therefore let the young men find favor in thy eyes; for on a festive day are we come: give, I pray thee, whatsoever thy hand is capable of unto thy servants, and to thy son, to David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.9'>And Davids young men came, and they spoke to Nabal in accordance with all these words in the name of David; and then they ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.10'>And Nabal answered the servants of David, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? nowadays there are many servants that break away every one from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.11'>Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my sheepshearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they are?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.12'>And Davids young men turned about on their way, and returned, and came and told him in accordance with all these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.13'>And David said unto his men, Gird ye on, every man, his sword. And they girded on, every man, his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men, and two hundred abode by the baggage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.14'>But one of the young men told Abigayil, Nabals wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master; but he hath spoken rudely to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.15'>Whereas the men have been very good unto us; and we have not been injured, neither have we missed any thing, all the time that we went about with them, while we were in the field:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.16'>A wall were they around us both by night and by day, all the time we were with them, feeding the flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.17'>And now know and consider what thou canst do; for evil is determined on against our master, and against all his household; and he is too greatly a worthless man for me to speak to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.18'>And Abigayil made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.19'>And she said unto her young men, Pass on before me: behold, I come after you. But to her husband Nabal she told nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.20'>And it was so, as she was riding on the ass, and coming down by the covert of the mount, that, behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.21'>Now David had said, Yea, for naught only have I guarded all that belongeth to this fellow in the wilderness, so that not the least was missed of all that pertained unto him; and he hath requited me evil instead of good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.22'>So may God do unto the enemies of David, and do so yet farther, if I leave of all that pertaineth to him by the morning light, as much as a dog.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.23'>And when Abigayil saw David, she hastened, and alighted off the ass, and fell down before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.24'>And she fell at his feet, and said, On me, me, my lord, is the fault: and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thy hearing, and listen to the words of thy handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.25'>Let not my Lord, I pray thee, turn his heart unto this worthless man, unto Nabal; for as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and meanness is with him; but I thy handmaid did not see the young men of my Lord, whom thou didst send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.26'>And now, my lord, as the Eternal liveth, and as thy soul liveth, it is the Lord who hath withholden thee from coming to bloodguiltiness, and from helping thyself with thy own hand; and now may like Nabal be thy enemies, and those that seek to do my Lord evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.27'>And now this present which thy handmaid hath brought unto my Lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow in the train my Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.28'>Pardon, I pray thee, the trespass of thy handmaid; for the Lord will certainly make for my lord an enduring house; because the battles of the Lord doth my lord fight, and evil will not be found in thee all thy days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.29'>And though a man is risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: yet will the soul of my Lord be bound in the bond of life with the Lord thy God; and the soul of thy enemies will he hurl away, as out of the middle of the sling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.30'>And it shall come to pass, when the Lord will do to my lord, in accordance with all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and will ordain thee as ruler over Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.31'>That this shall not be unto thee as a cause of offense and as a reproach of heart unto my lord, both by having shed blood without cause, and by my lord having righted himself; and when the Lord will do good unto my lord, then do thou remember thy handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.32'>And David said to Abigayil, Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.33'>And blessed be thy intelligence, and blessed be thou, who hast prevented me this day from coming unto bloodguiltiness, and from helping myself with my own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.34'>But truly, as the Lord the God of Israel liveth, who hath withdrawn me from injuring thee, except thou hadst hastened and come to meet me, surely there would not have been left unto Nabal by the morninglight so much as a dog.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.35'>And David took out of her hand that which she had brought him; and unto her he said, Go up in peace to thy house: see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have respected thy presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.36'>And Abigayil came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabals heart was merry within him, and he was exceedingly drunken; wherefore she told him not a word, either little or great, until the morninglight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.37'>But it happened in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things; and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.38'>And it came to pass in about ten days thereafter, that the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.39'>And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the Lord, who hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath withheld his servant from evil; and the wickedness of Nabal hath the Lord returned upon his own head. And David sent and applied for Abigayil, to take her to himself for wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.40'>And the servants of David came to Abigayil to Carmel, and they spoke unto her, saying, David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to himself for wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.41'>Thereupon she arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thy handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.42'>And Abigayil hastened, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with her five damsels that went in her train; and she went after the messengers of David, and she became his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.43'>David also took Achinoam of Yizreel; and both of them became thus his wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.44'>But Saul had given Michal his daughter, Davids wife, to Palti, the son of Layish, who was of Gallim.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.26'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.1'>And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibah, saying, Behold, David hideth himself on the hill of Chachilah, before the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.2'>Then arose Saul, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and with him were three thousand men chosen out of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.3'>And Saul encamped on the hill of Chachilah, which is before the desert by the way; but David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul was coming after him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.4'>David thereupon sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come for a certainty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.5'>And David arose, and came to the place where Saul was encamped; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army; and Saul was lying in the midst of the ring, and the people were encamped round about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.6'>Then commenced David and said to Achimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruyah, the brother of Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will readily go down with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.7'>So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the ring, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head; but Abner and the people were lying round about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.8'>Then said Abishai to David, God hath surrendered this day thy enemy into thy hand: and now let me strike him through, I pray thee, with the spear, even to the earth with one blow, and I will not give him a second one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.9'>But David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who hath stretched forth his hand against the Lords anointed, and remained guiltless?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.10'>David said farthermore, As the Lord liveth, the Lord alone shall strike him down: either his day shall come that he die; or he shall go down into battle, and perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.11'>Far be this from me for the sake of the Lord, that I should stretch forth my hand against the Lords anointed; but now, I pray thee, take thou the spear that is by his head, and the cruise of water, and let us go our way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.12'>So David took the spear and the cruise of water by the head of Saul, and they went their way; and no one saw it, and no one perceived it, andno one awaked; for they were all sleeping; because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.13'>Then went David over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mount afar off, the space between them being great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.14'>And David called to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Wilt thou not answer, Abner? And Abner answered and said, Who art thou that callest to the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.15'>And David said to Abner, Art thou not a man? and who is like to thee in Israel? why then hast thou not kept guard over thy lord the king? for there came one of the people to destroy the king thy lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.16'>This thing which thou hast done is not good. As the Lord liveth, ye deserve to die; because ye have not kept guard over your master, over the Lords anointed. And now see, where is the kings spear, and the cruise of water that was by his head?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.17'>And Saul recognized Davids voice, and he said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my Lord, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.18'>And he said, Why is this that my lord doth pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.19'>And now, I pray thee, let my Lord the king hear the words of his servant! If the Lord have stirred thee up against me, then may he accept the savor of an offering; but if they be the children of men, then be they cursed before the Lord; because they have driven me out this day so that I cannot attach myself on the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.20'>Now, therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth far from the presence of the Lord; for the king of Israel is come out to seek a single flea, as one doth usually pursue a partridge on the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.21'>Then said Saul, I have sinned; return, my son David; for I will not do thee harm any more, for the cause that my life was precious in thy eyes this day: behold, I have acted foolishly, and have erred exceedingly much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.22'>And David answered and said, Behold, here is the kings spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.23'>And may the Lord recompense to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; since the Lord delivered thee into my hand today, and I would not stretch forth my hand against the anointed of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.24'>And behold, as thy life was highly valued this day in my eyes, so may my life be highly valued in the eyes of the Lord, and may he deliver me out of all tribulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.25'>Then said Saul to David, Blessed be thou my son David: thou wilt both do great things, and wilt also surely prevail. And David went then on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.1'>And David said in his heart, Now I may yet perish suddenly one day by the hand of Saul; there is nothing better for me than that I should escape at once into the land of the Philistines, then Saul will abstain from me, to seek me any more in all the territory of Israel: and so shall I escape out of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.2'>And David arose, and he passed over himself with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, the king of Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.3'>And David remained with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, also David with his two wives, Achinoam the Yizreelitess, and Abigayil, Nabals wife, the Carmelitess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.4'>And when it was told unto Saul that David was fled to Gath, he continued no more to seek for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.5'>And David said unto Achish, If now I have found grace in thy eyes, let them give me a place in some one of the countrytowns, that I may dwell there; for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.6'>Then gave Achish unto him on that day Ziklag: therefore hath Ziklag pertained unto the kings of Judah until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.7'>And the number of the days that David dwelt in the fields of the Philistines was a full year and four months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.8'>And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gizrites, and the Amalekites; for these nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, till thou comest to Shur, and as far as the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.9'>And David smote the land, and left not alive either man or woman, and took away the flocks, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.10'>And Achish said, Whither have ye made an inroad today? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Yerachmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.11'>And David left not alive either man or woman, to bring them to Gath, saying, That they may not tell on us, saying, So hath David done, and so is his custom all the days he hath dwelt in the fields of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.12'>And Achish had confidence in David, saying, He hath surely spoiled his odor among his people, among Israel; and he will become unto me a servant for ever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.28'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.1'>And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their camps together for warfare, to fight with Israel; and Achish said unto David, Thou must know that thou shalt go out with me into the camp, thou and thy men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.2'>And David said to Achish, By reason of this wilt thou thyself ascertain what thy servant will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee the guard of my head for all times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.3'>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city; and Saul had removed those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.4'>And the Philistines assembled themselves together, and came and encamped at Shunem: and Saul assembled together all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.5'>And when Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.6'>And Saul asked counsel of the Lord; but the Lord answered him not, either by means of dreams, or by means of the Urim, or by means of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.7'>Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek out for me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.8'>And Saul disguised himself, and put on other garments, and he went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Divine, I pray thee, unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring up for me the one whom I shall say unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.9'>And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou well knowest that which Saul hath done, that he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land; wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.10'>And Saul swore to her by the Lord, saying, As the Lord liveth, there shall no guilt attach to thee for this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.11'>Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up for thee? And he said, Samuel thou must bring up for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.12'>And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman said to Saul thus, Why hast thou deceived me? since thou art Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.13'>And the king said unto her, Be not afraid; however, what hast thou seen? And the woman said unto Saul, A divine being have I seen ascending out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.14'>And he said unto her, What is his form? And she said, An old man is coming up; and he is wrapt in a mantle. And so Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and prostrated himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.15'>And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am greatly distressed, and the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and hath not answered me any more, either by the agency of the prophets, or by means of dreams; wherefore I have called thee, to make known unto me what I shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.16'>Then said Samuel, And why wilt thou ask me, seeing the Lord is departed from thee, and is become thy enemy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.17'>And the Lord hath done for himself as he hath spoken through my agency; and the Lord hath rent the government out of thy hand, and hath given it to thy associate, to David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.18'>As thou didst not obey the voice of the Lord, and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek; therefore hath the Lord done this thing unto thee this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.19'>And the Lord will deliver also Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: also the camp of Israel will the Lord deliver into the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.20'>Then fell Saul hastily with his full length to the earth, and was greatly afraid, because of the words of Samuel: there was also no strength in him; for he had not eaten any food all that day, and all that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.21'>And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was greatly terrified; and she said unto him, Behold, thy handmaid hath obeyed thy voice; and I put my life in my hand, and hearkened unto thy words which thou spokest unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.22'>And now, hearken thou also, I pray thee, unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set before thee a morsel of bread, and eat; that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.23'>But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants urged him much, as also the woman; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.24'>And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she hastened, and slaughtered it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread thereof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.25'>And she brought it near before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.29'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.1'>Now the Philistines assembled together all their camps at Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is by Yizreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.2'>And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; but David and his men passed on at the last with Achish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.3'>Then said the princes of the Philistines, What are these Hebrews to do? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Behold, this is David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me already a year, or even years, and I have not found the least in him to blame from the day of his joining me until this day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.4'>And the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Cause this man to go back, that he may return to his place whither thou hast assigned him; but he shall not go down with us to the battle, that he may not become an adversary to us in the battle; for wherewith could this person reconcile himself unto his master? is it not by means of the heads of these men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.5'>Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in the dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.6'>Then did Achish call David, and say unto him, As the Lord liveth, I declare that thou art upright, and that thy going out and thy coming in with me in the camp is good in my eyes; for I have not found in thee any evil from the day of thy coming unto me until this day; nevertheless in the eyes of the lords thou art not good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.7'>And now return, and go in peace, that thou mayest not do any evil in the eyes of the lords of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.8'>And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant from the day that I have been before thee, until this day, that I shall not go to fight against the enemies of my Lord the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.9'>And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my eyes, as an angel of God; nevertheless, the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.10'>And now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy master that are come with thee: and rise then up early in the morning, and when ye have light, go away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.11'>And David and his men rose up early to go away in the morning, to return unto the land of the Philistines; but the Philistines went up to Yizreel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.30'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.1'>And it came to pass when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burnt it with fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.2'>And had taken captive the women that were therein, both great and small: they had not slain any one, but had led them off, and gone on their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.3'>When therefore David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burnt with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, had been taken captive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.4'>And David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.5'>And the two wives of David were also taken captive, Achinoam the Yizreelitess, and Abigayil the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.6'>And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was imbittered, every man for his sons and for his daughters; but David fortified himself in the Lord his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.7'>And David said to Ebyathar the priest, the son of Achimelech, Bring hither, I pray thee, unto me the ephod. And Ebyathar brought the ephod near unto David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.8'>And David asked counsel of the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop! shall I overtake them? And he said to him, Pursue; for thou wilt surely overtake them, and certainly recover all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.9'>So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came up to the brook Bessor, where those that were left behind stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.10'>But David pursued on, he and four hundred men; and there stayed behind two hundred men, who were too fatigued to go over the brook Bessor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.11'>And they found an Egyptian man in the field, and took him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.12'>And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins, and he ate, and then his spirit returned to him; for he had not eaten any bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.13'>And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young Egyptian man, the servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me behind, because I fell sick, today three days ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.14'>We made an invasion upon the south of the Kerethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and Ziklag did we burn with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.15'>And David said to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt not kill me, and that thou wilt not surrender me into the hand of my master, and then will I bring thee down to this troop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.16'>And he brought him down; and behold, they were scattered over the face of all the country, eating and drinking, and dancing for joy, because of all the great spoil which they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.17'>And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day; and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.18'>And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken away; and his two wives also did David rescue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.19'>And there was nothing missing to them, from small to great, as also sons and daughters, and spoil, down to every thing that they had taken from them: the whole did David bring back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.20'>And David took all the flocks and the herds: these they drove before those other cattle, and said, This is Davids spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.21'>And David came to the two hundred men, who had been too fatigued to follow after David, and whom they had left to remain at the brook Bessor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him; and David came near to the people, and asked them after their wellbeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.22'>Then exclaimed every wicked and worthless man, of those that had gone with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, and these they may lead away, and go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.23'>Then said David, Ye must not do so, my brethren; since the Lord hath given us this, and guarded us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.24'>And who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as is the part of him that went down to the battle, so shall be the part of him that remained with the baggage: together must they share.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.25'>And it happened from that day and forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.26'>And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, Behold, here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.27'>To those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in south Ramoth, and to those who were in Yattir,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.28'>And to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.29'>And to those who were in Rachal, and to those who were in the cities of Yerachmeelites, and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.30'>And to those who were in Chormah, and to those who were in Korashan, and to those who were in Athach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.31'>And to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men had wandered about.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.31'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.1'>Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and there fell down many slain on mount Gilboa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.2'>And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines smote Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malkishua, the sons of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.3'>And the battle was heavy against Saul, and he was found by the archers, the men with bows; and he was greatly in dread of the archers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.4'>And Saul said unto his armorbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and wantonly illuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was greatly afraid; wherefore Saul took the sword, and fell upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.5'>And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, then fell he likewise upon his sword, and died with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.6'>Thus died Saul, and his three sons, and his armorbearer, also all his men, on that same day together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.7'>And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and those that were on the other side of the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel had fled, and that Saul and his sons had died: they forsook the cities, and fled away; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.8'>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the Philistines came to strip the slain; and they found Saul and his three sons fallen on mount Gilboa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.9'>And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent it into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.10'>And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth; and his body they fastened to the wall of Bethshan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.11'>And when the inhabitants of Yabeshgilad heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.12'>Then arose all the valiant men, and walked all the night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and they came to Yabesh, and burnt them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.13'>And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisktree at Yabesh, and they fasted seven days.</verse>
