      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>Truly, O Theophilus, I made the first report as to all things that Jesus began both to do and teach</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>until the day He was taken up, having given directions to the apostles whom He chose, through [the] Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>to whom He also presented Himself living after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them through forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>And having met with [them], He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father which you heard from Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>For John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in [the] Holy Spirit not many days from now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>Then, indeed, these coming together, they asked Him, saying, Lord, do You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>And He said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in His own authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>But you shall receive power, the Holy Spirit coming upon you. And you shall be witnesses to Me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and to [the] end of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>And saying these things, [as] they watched, He was taken up. And a cloud received Him out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>And while they were looking intently into the heaven, He having gone, even behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>who also said, Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into the heaven? This same Jesus who is taken up from you into Heaven, will come in the way you have seen Him going into Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then they returned to Jerusalem from [the] mount Of Olive Grove, which is a sabbath day's [journey] from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>And when they had come in, they went up into an upper room, where Peter and James, and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James [the son] of Alpheus and Simon Zelotes, and Judas [the brother] of James;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>these all were continuing with one accord in prayer and supplication, with [the] women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>And in those days Peter stood up in [the] midst of the disciples and said, ( the] number of names together [was] about a hundred and twenty,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>Men, brothers, this Scripture must have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, who became guide to those who seized Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>For he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>Indeed, then, this one purchased a field with the reward of unrighteousness. And falling headlong, he burst apart in [the] middle, and all his bowels gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>And it was known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem, so much so that that field is called in their own dialect, Akeldama, that is to say, Field of Blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>For it is written in [the] Book of Psalms, Let his estate become forsaken, and he not be living in it. And, Let another take his overseership.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>Therefore, it is right that one of these men who have companied with us all [the] time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>beginning from the baptism of John to that same day that He was taken up from us, to become a witness with us of His resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>And they prayed and said, You, Lord, knower of all hearts, show which one You chose from these two,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>to take the share of this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell, to go to [his] own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>And they gave forth their lots. And the lot fell upon Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>And in the fulfilling of the day of Pentecost, they were all with one accord in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>And suddenly a sound came out of the heaven as borne along by the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>And tongues as of fire appeared to them, being distributed; and it sat upon each of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>And they were all filled of the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>And dwelling at Jerusalem there were Jews, devout men out of every nation under heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>But this sound occurring, the multitude came together and were confounded, because they each heard them speaking in his own dialect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>And they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, Behold, are not these who speak all Galileans?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>And how do we each hear in our own dialect in which we were born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya around Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking the great things of God in our own languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying to one another, What does this mean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>But others mocking said, These men are full of sweet wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>But Peter, standing up with the Eleven, lifted up his voice and said to them, Men, Jews, and all who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>For these are not drunk as you suppose, for it is [the] third hour of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>And it shall be in the last days, says God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh. And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>And in those days I will pour out My Spirit upon My slaves and My slave women, and they shall prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>And I will give wonders in the heaven above, and miracles on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before that great and glorious Day of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>And it shall be [that] everyone who shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>Men, Israelites, hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by powerful works, and wonders and miracles, which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>this One given [to you] by the before-determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, [you] have taken and by lawless hands, crucifying [Him], you put Him to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>For David speaks concerning Him, I foresaw the Lord always before me, because He is at my right hand, that I should not be moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>Therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue was glad; and also My flesh shall rest in hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>because You will not leave My soul in Hades, nor will You allow Your holy One to see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>You revealed to Me the ways of life. You will fill Me with joy with Your countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>Men, brothers, it is permitted to say to you with plainness as to the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of [the] fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, He would raise up Christ to sit upon his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>seeing this beforehand, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor would His flesh see corruption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>God raised up this Jesus, of which we all are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>Therefore being exalted to the right of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured out this which you now see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>For David has not ascended into the heavens, but he says himself, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right [hand]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>until I place Your enemies [as] a footstool to Your feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God made this same Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>And hearing [this], they were stabbed in the heart, and said to Peter and to the other apostles, Men, brothers, what shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>Then Peter said to them, Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ to remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all those afar off, as many as [the] Lord our God shall call.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>And with many other words he earnestly testified and exhorted, saying, Be saved from this perverse generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>Then those who gladly received his word were baptized. And the same day there were added about three thousand souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>And they were continuing steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine, and in fellowship and in the breaking of the loaves, and in prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>And fear came on every soul. And many wonders and miracles took place through the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>And all who believed were together and had all things common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>And they sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>And continuing with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they shared food with gladness and simplicity of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>And on the same [day] Peter and John went up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth [hour].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>And a certain man, who was lame from his mother's womb, was being carried. And they laid him daily at that temple gate which is called Beautiful, to ask alms from those who entered into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked [to receive] alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>And fastening his eyes on him, Peter with John said, Look on us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>And he paid heed to them, expecting to receive something from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>But Peter said, Silver and gold have I none, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>And taking him by the right hand, he lifted [him] up. And immediately his feet and ankle-bones received strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>And leaping up, he stood and walked and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>And all the people saw him walking and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>And they recognized him, that it was him who sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>And as the lame one who was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>And seeing [this], Peter answered the people, Men, Israelites, why do you marvel at this? Or why do you stare at us, as [though] we had made this man to walk by our own power or holiness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His son Jesus, whom you delivered up, denying Him in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to let [Him] go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>But you denied the Holy and Just [One] and desired a murderer to be given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>And you killed the Prince of Life, whom God has raised from [the] dead, of which we are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, this one whom you see and know, His name made firm. And the faith which came through Him has given him this perfect soundness before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>And now, brothers, I know that you did [it] through ignorance, as also your rulers [did].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>But those things which God before had shown by the mouth of all His prophets, [that] Christ should suffer, He fulfilled in this manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Therefore repent and convert so that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from [the] presence of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>And He shall send Jesus Christ, who before was proclaimed to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>whom Heaven truly needs to receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God has spoken by [the] mouth of His holy prophets since the world began.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>For Moses truly said to the fathers,  The] Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet to you from your brothers, [One] like me. You shall hear Him in all things, whatever He may say to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>And it shall be [that] every soul who will not hear that Prophet shall be destroyed from among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>And also all the prophets from Samuel and those following after, as many as spoke, have likewise foretold of these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your Seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>Having raised up His son Jesus, God sent Him to you first, to bless you in turning every one of you away from his iniquities.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>And [as] they spoke to the people, the priests, and the temple commander, and the Sadducees came on them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>being grieved that they taught the people, even to announce through Jesus the resurrection from [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>[And they] laid hands on [them] and put [them] under guard until the next day, for it was already evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>But many of those who heard the Word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>And it happened on the next day that their rulers and elders and scribes, gathered to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name have you done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter, filled with [the] Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>if we are examined today on a good work for an infirm man, by what this one has been healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from [the] dead, in this [name] does this man stand before you whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>This is the Stone which you builders have counted worthless, and He has become the Head of [the] Corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>And there is salvation in no other One; for there is no other name under Heaven given among men by which we must be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>But seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and perceiving that they were unlearned and uneducated men, they marveled. And they recognized them, that they had been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>And beholding the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>And when they had commanded them to go aside out of the sanhedrin, they conferred among themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>saying, What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them is plain to all those dwelling in Jerusalem. And we cannot deny [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>But, so that it spread no further among the people, let us strictly threaten them, [that] they speak to no man in this name from now on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all, nor to teach in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right before God to listen to you more than to God, you judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way [as to] how they might punish them, because of the people. For all glorified God for that which was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>For the man on whom this miracle of healing occurred was more than forty years [old].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>And being let go, they went to their own company and reported what the chief priests and elders had said [to them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>And having heard, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said, Lord, You [are] the God who made the heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that is in them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>who by the mouth of Your servant David has said, Why did the nations rage and the people imagine vain things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>For truly, against Your holy child Jesus, whom You have anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations, and [the] people of Israel, were gathered together</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>in order to do whatever Your hand and Your counsel determined before to be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your Word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.30'>by stretching forth of Your hand for healing, and miracles, and wonders may be done by the name of Your holy child Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled was shaken. And they were all filled with [the] Holy Spirit, and they spoke the Word of God with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul. And not one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own. But they had all things common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>And the apostles gave witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power. And great grace was on them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>For neither was anyone needy among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold [them] and brought the prices of the [things] that were sold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.35'>and they laid [them] down at the apostles' feet. And distribution was made to every man according as he had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>And Joses, who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles (which is, being translated, The son of consolation), a Levite, a Cypriot by race,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.37'>a field being his, selling [it], he bore the proceeds and placed [them] at the apostles' feet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>And a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.2'>And he kept back [part] of the price, his wife also knowing, and brought a certain part and laid [it] at the apostles' feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart [for] you to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back [part] of the price of the land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it [not] in your own authority? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.9'>Then Peter said to her, How [is it] that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of [the] Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband [are] at the door and they will carry you out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.10'>Then at once she fell down at his feet and expired. And the younger ones found her dead, and, carrying [her] out, buried her beside her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>And great fear came on all the church and on as many as heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>And many miracles and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's Porch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.13'>And of the rest no one dared to join himself to them, but the people magnified them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>and more believing ones were added to [the] Lord, multitudes both of men and women;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>So as to carry out the sick into the streets and place [them] on cots and mattresses, so that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>And hearing, they went into the temple about dawn, and taught. But the high priest came, and those with him. And they called the sanhedrin together, and all the elderhood of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.22'>But having come near, the officers did not find them in the prison. And returning, reported,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>saying, We indeed found the prison shut with all safety, and the keepers standing outside in front of the doors. But having opened it, we found no one inside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>And when the high priest and the temple commander and the chief priests heard these things, they were bewildered about them, what this might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>But one came, reporting to them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>Then the commander went with the officers [and] brought them, not with force, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.27'>And bringing them, they stood in the sanhedrin. And the high priest asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.28'>saying, Did we not strictly command you [that] you not teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>And Peter and the apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed and hanged on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.31'>This One God [has] exalted [to be] a Ruler and Savior to His right [hand] in order to give repentance and remission of sins to Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>Then there stood up one in the sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law honored among all the people. And he commanded the apostles to be put outside a little space.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.35'>And he said to them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do [regarding] these men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>For before these days Theudas rose up, boasting himself to be somebody; a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves to him; who was slain. And all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered and brought to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.37'>After this one, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the Registration, and drew away considerable people after him. Yet that one perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.38'>And now I say to you, withdraw from these men and let them alone. For if this counsel or this work is of men, it will come to nothing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.41'>Then indeed they departed from [the] presence of the sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be shamed for His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.42'>And every day in the temple, and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching the gospel: Jesus Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.1'>And Saul, still breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.2'>and asked letters from him to Damascus to the synagogues; so that if he found any of the Way, whether they were men or women, he might bring [them] bound to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.3'>But in going, it happened as he drew near to Damascus, even suddenly a light from the heaven shone around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.4'>And he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.5'>And he said, Who are you, lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you persecute. [It is] hard for you to kick against the goads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.6'>And trembling and astonished, he said, Lord, what will You have me to do? And the Lord [said] to him, Arise and go into the city, and you shall be told what you must do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.7'>And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, indeed hearing a voice but seeing no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>And Saul was lifted up from the earth, his eyes were opened, but he saw no one. But they led him by the hand and brought [him] into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>And he was three days not seeing, and did not eat or drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>And there was a certain disciple in Damascus named Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias! And he said, Behold me, Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>And the Lord [said] to him, Arise and go into the street which is called Straight and inquire in [the] house of Judas for [one] called Saul of Tarsus. For behold, he is praying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>and has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and putting [his] hand on him so that he might receive his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how many evil things he has done to Your saints at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your Name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>But the Lord said to him, Go! For this one is a chosen vessel to Me, to bear My name before nations and kings and the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>For I will show him what great things he must suffer for My name's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>And Ananias went and entered into the house. And putting his hands on him, [he] said, Brother Saul, the Lord, Jesus, who appeared to you in the way in which you came, has sent me to you that you might see and be filled with [the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>And instantly scales as it were fell from his eyes, and he instantly saw again. And rising up, he was baptized.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>And immediately he proclaimed Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>But all who heard [him] were amazed and said, Is this not he who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem and came here for that reason, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>But their plot was known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night in order to kill him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>And a certain man named Cornelius was in Caesarea, a centurion of the Italian cohort,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>About the ninth hour of the day he saw plainly in a vision an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, Cornelius!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>And he was gazing at him, and becoming terrified, he said, What is it, lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and your merciful deeds have come up for a memorial before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>And now send men to Joppa and call for Simon, whose last name is Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>He is staying with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by [the] seaside. He will tell you what you must do.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>And explaining all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>On the next day, as these went on [the] road, and drawing near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about [the] sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>And he became very hungry and desired to eat. But while they made ready, an ecstasy fell on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>And he saw the heaven opened and a certain vessel like a sheet coming down to him, being bound at the four corners and let down to the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>in which were all the four-footed animals of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the reptiles, and the birds of the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>And a voice came to him, saying, Rise, Peter! Kill and eat!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>But Peter said, Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>And the voice [spoke] to him again the second [time], What God has made clean, you do not call common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>This happened three [times], and the vessel was received up again into the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>And while Peter doubted within himself what the vision which he had seen might be, even behold, the men who were sent from Cornelius had asked for Simon's house and stood on the porch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>And they called and asked if Simon whose last name is Peter was staying there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>And [while] Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are looking for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>Therefore arise and go down and go with them without doubting, for I have sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>And going down to the men, those sent to him from Cornelius, Peter said, Behold, I am [the one] you are seeking. For what reason have you come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man and [one] who fears God, and one of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear words from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>Then he called them in and lodged [them]. And on the next day Peter went away with them, and certain brothers from Joppa went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>And the next day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at [his] feet [and] worshiped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up! I also am a man myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many who had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>And he said to them, You know that it is an unlawful thing for a man, a Jew to keep company with or to come near to one of another nation. But God has shown me not to call any man common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>Therefore I came without complaint, being sent for. I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour. And at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>And he said, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your merciful deeds have been remembered before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>Therefore send to Joppa and call here Simon whose last name is Peter, he is staying in [the] house of Simon, a tanner by the seaside; who, when he comes, shall speak to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>Therefore I immediately sent to you, and you have done well [to] come. Now therefore we are all here present before God to hear all things that are commanded you by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>Then Peter opened [his] mouth and said, Truly I see that God is no respecter of persons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>but in every nation he who fears Him and works righteousness is accepted with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>You know the word which [God] sent to the sons of Israel, preaching the gospel of peace by Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all!);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>that word which was published throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with [the] Holy Spirit and with power, and He went about doing good, and healing all those who were oppressed by the Devil, for God was with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>And we are witnesses of all things which He did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed [Him] and hanged [Him] on a tree;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>but God raised Him up the third day and showed Him openly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>not to all the people, but to witnesses hand-picked before by God, [even] to us who ate and drank with Him after He rose from [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>And He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is He who was ordained of God [to be] the Judge of [the] living and [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>All the prophets give witness to Him, [that] through His name whoever believes in Him [shall] receive remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those hearing the Word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>And those of the circumcision, who believed (as many as came with Peter), were astonished because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on the nations also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter answered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>Can anyone forbid water that these, who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we, should not be baptized?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they begged him to stay certain days.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>And the apostles and brothers who were in Judea heard that the nations had also received the Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>And when Peter had come up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>saying, You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>But Peter related [the matter] from the beginning and explained [it] by order to them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>I was in [the] city of Joppa praying. And in an ecstasy I saw a vision, a certain vessel like a sheet coming down, let down from the sky by four corners. And it came even to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>When I had fastened my eyes on [it], I looked and saw four-footed animals of the earth, and wild beasts, and reptiles, and birds of the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>And I heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter! Kill and eat!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>But I said, Not so, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>But the voice answered me again from the heaven, What God has made clean, you do not call common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>And this was done three [times], and all were drawn up again into the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>And behold, immediately three men stood at the house in which I was, sent from Caesarea to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>And the Spirit told me to go with them, not discriminating. And these six brothers [went] with me, and we entered the man's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>And he declared to us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa and call for Simon whose last name is Peter,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at [the] beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>And I remembered the Word of the Lord, how He said, John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>If God gave to them the same gift as to us, they] having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to be able to prevent God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>When they heard these things, they were silent and glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted repentance to life to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>Then, indeed, they who were scattered abroad by the persecution that rose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, preaching the Word to no one except the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene; who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>And [the] hand of [the] Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.4'>Then these indeed sent out by the Holy Spirit went down to Seleucia. And from there they sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.5'>And when they were at Salamis, they announced the Word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they also had John as an assistant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.6'>And when they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain conjurer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name [was] Bar-jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.7'>who was with the proconsul of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man. He called for Barnabas and Saul and asked to hear the Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.8'>But Elymas the conjurer (for so his name is, if translated) withstood them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.9'>Then Saul (who [is] also Paul), filled with [the] Holy Spirit, set his eyes on him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.10'>and said, O son of the Devil, full of all deceit and all craftiness, enemy of all righteousness, will you not stop perverting the right ways of [the] Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.11'>And now, behold, [the] hand of the Lord [is] on you. And you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a while. And immediately a mist and a darkness fell on him, and he went about seeking [some to] lead him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.12'>Then, seeing the thing happening, the proconsul believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.13'>And Paul and those around [him] sailed from Paphos and came to Perga of Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.14'>But going through from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.15'>And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men, brothers, if you have any word of comfort for the people, speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.16'>And rising up and signaling with his hand, Paul said, Men, Israelites, and those fearing God, listen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.17'>The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people in their residency in [the] land [of] Egypt, and He brought them out of it with a high arm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.18'>And about the time of forty years He tenderly bore them in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.19'>And when He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave their land to them as an inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.20'>And after that He gave [them] judges for about four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.21'>And afterward they asked [for] a king. And God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of [the] tribe of Benjamin, [for] forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.22'>And when He had removed him, He raised up David to them to be their king; to whom He also witnessed and said, I have found David the [son] of Jesse [to be] a man after My own heart, who shall fulfill all My will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.23'>Of this [man's] seed God has raised to Israel, according to [His] promise, a Savior, Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.24'>John having before proclaimed the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel, before His coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.25'>And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Who do you think that I am? I am not [He]. But behold, One comes after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.26'>Men, brothers, sons of [the] race of Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, the word of this salvation is sent to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.27'>For those living in Jerusalem, and their rulers, not having known this One, and the voices of the prophets being read throughout every sabbath, condemning [Him], they fulfilled [the Scriptures].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.28'>And finding not one cause of death [in Him], they begged Pilate to do away with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.29'>And when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him, taking [Him] down from the tree, they laid [Him] in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.30'>But God raised Him from [the] dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.31'>who appeared for many days by those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.32'>And we preach the gospel to you, the promise made to the fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.33'>this God has fulfilled to us their children, raising up Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm, You are My Son, this day I have begotten You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.34'>And that He raised Him up from [the] dead, no more to return to corruption, He spoke in this way: I will give you the holy promises of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.35'>Therefore he also says in another [psalm], You shall not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.36'>For after he had served [his] own generation by the will of God, David fell asleep and was added to his fathers and saw corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.37'>But [He] whom God raised again saw no corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.38'>Therefore be it known to you, men, brothers, that through this One the forgiveness of sins is announced to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.39'>And by Him all who believe are justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.40'>Therefore beware lest that come on you which is spoken of in the prophets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.41'>Behold, you despisers, and marvel, and perish; for I work a work in your days, a work which you shall in no way believe, though a man declare [it] to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.42'>And the Jews having gone out of the synagogue, the nations begged that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.43'>And the synagogue being broken up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.44'>And on the coming sabbath day almost all the city came together to hear the Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.45'>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy and contradicted those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.46'>But speaking boldly, Paul and Barnabas said, It was necessary [for] the word of God to be spoken to you first. But since indeed you put it far from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.47'>For so the Lord has commanded us, [saying], I have set You to be a light of the nations, for salvation to the end of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.48'>And hearing, the nations rejoiced and glorified the Word of the Lord. And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.49'>And the Word of the Lord was carried throughout all the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.50'>But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief ones of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas. And they threw them out of their borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.51'>But shaking the dust of their feet off on them, they came into Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.52'>And the disciples were filled with joy and with [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.14'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.1'>And it happened in Iconium, they both went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and spoke so as a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.2'>But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the nations and made them evil-hearted against the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.3'>Therefore they stayed a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who bore witness to the word of His grace, giving miracles and wonders to be done by their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.4'>But the multitude of the city was divided. And part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.5'>And when there was an assault made by both the nations and the Jews, with their rulers, in order to insult and to stone them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.6'>they were aware of [it] and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the country around them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.7'>And there they were preaching the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.8'>And a certain man was sitting in Lystra, without strength in the feet, being lame from his mother's womb, who never had walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.9'>This one heard Paul speaking; [and Paul], looking intently at him, and seeing that he had faith to be healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.10'>said with a loud voice, Stand up on your feet! And he leaped and walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>And seeing what Paul did, the crowd lifted up their voice, saying in Lycaonian, The gods have come down to us, becoming like men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.12'>And they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.13'>And the priest of Jupiter, being before their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, wishing to sacrifice with the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.14'>But hearing [this], the apostles Barnabas and Paul tore their clothes and ran in among the people, crying out</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.15'>and saying, Men, why do you do these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preaching the gospel to you to turn [you] from these vanities to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all things in them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.16'>who in past generations allowed all nations to walk in their [own] ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.17'>And yet He did not leave Himself without witness, doing good, giving rain and fruitful season to us from heaven, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.18'>And saying these things, they scarcely stopped the people from sacrificing to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.19'>And Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, who, having persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, they drew [him] out of the city, supposing him to have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.20'>But the disciples surrounding him, he rose up and came into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.21'>And preaching the gospel to that city, and having made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.22'>confirming the souls of the disciples, calling on them to continue in the faith and that through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.23'>And having hand-picked elders for them in every church, and had prayed with fastings, they commended them to the Lord into whom they believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.24'>And passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.25'>And speaking the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.26'>And from there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.27'>And having arrived, and gathering the church they related all that God had done with them, and how He had opened the door of faith to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.28'>And they stayed there not a little time with the disciples.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.15'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.1'>And certain ones who came down from Judea taught the brothers, [saying], Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.2'>Therefore dissension and not a little disputation occurring by Paul and Barnabas, they appointed Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.3'>And indeed being set forward by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the nations. And they caused great joy to all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.4'>And arriving in Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and [by] the apostles and elders. And [they] declared all things that God had done with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.5'>But some of those from the sect of the Pharisees, having believed, rose up, saying, It was necessary to circumcise them and to command [them] to keep the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.6'>And the apostles and elders were assembled to see about this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>And after much disputing, Peter rose up and said to them, Men, brothers, you recognize that from ancient days God chose among us [that] through my mouth the nations [should] hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.8'>And God, who knows the hearts, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit even as to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.9'>And He put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.10'>Now therefore why do you tempt God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples, a yoke which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.11'>But we believe that through the grace of [the] Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, according to which manner they also believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.12'>And all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul declaring what miracles and wonders God had worked among the nations through them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.13'>And after they were silent, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.14'>Even as Simon has declared [how] God [at] the first visited the nations to take out of them a people for His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.15'>And the words of the prophets agree to this; as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.16'>After this I will return and will build again the tabernacle of David [which] has fallen down; and I will build again its ruins, and I will set it up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.17'>so those men who are left might seek after the Lord, and all the nations on whom My name has been called, says the Lord, who does all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.18'>All His works are known to God from eternity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.19'>Therefore my judgment is that we do not trouble those who have turned to God from among the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.20'>but that we write to them that they should abstain from pollutions of idols, and [from] fornication, and [from] things strangled, and from blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.21'>For Moses from ages past has those in every city proclaiming him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.22'>Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men from them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; Judas, whose last name was Barsabas; and Silas, chief men among the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.23'>And they wrote these things by their hand: The apostles and elders and brothers [send] greeting to the brothers, from [the] nations in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.24'>Because we have heard that certain ones who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, Be circumcised and keep the law! (to whom we gave no such command);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.25'>it seemed [good] to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.26'>men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who will also announce [to you] the same things by word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.28'>For it seemed [good] to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these necessary things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.29'>that you abstain from meats offered to idols, and [from] blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which, if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Be prospered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.30'>Then indeed they being let go, they came to Antioch. And gathering the multitude, [they] delivered the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.31'>And when they had read [it], they rejoiced at the comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.32'>And Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words and confirmed [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.33'>And remaining for a time, they were let go in peace from the brothers to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.34'>But it pleased Silas to remain there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.35'>Also Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the gospel, the Word of the Lord, with many others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.36'>And some days afterward, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brothers in every city where we have announced the Word of the Lord, to see] how they are holding to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.37'>And Barnabas determined to take with [them] John, he being called Mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.38'>But Paul thought it well not to take that one with [them], he having withdrawn from them from Pamphylia, and did not go with them to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.39'>Then there was sharp feeling, so as to separate them from each other. And taking Mark, Barnabas sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.40'>But choosing Silas, Paul went out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.41'>passing through Syria and Cilicia, making the churches strong.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>And he came to Derbe and Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple named Timothy was there, [the] son of a woman who was a Jewess and who believed. But [his] father [was] a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.2'>[He] was well reported of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Paul wanted him to go with him, and taking [him he] circumcised him, because of the Jews who were in those places; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>And as they passed through the cities, they delivered to them the commandments to keep, the ones that were ordained by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.5'>Then indeed the churches were established in the faith and increased in number daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.6'>And coming through the Phrygian and the Galatian region; and by the Holy Spirit being forbidden to speak the Word in Asia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.7'>having come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia. But the Spirit did not allow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>Then passing by Mysia, they came down into Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. A certain man of Macedonia stood, begging him, saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.11'>Then having set sail from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next [day] to Neapolis;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.12'>and from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we continued spending time in that city some days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was usually made. And we sat down and spoke to the women who came together [there].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>And a certain woman named Lydia heard us, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God; whose heart the Lord opened, so that she attended to the things which were spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>And when she was baptized, she and her household, she begged us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay. And she constrained us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>And as we went to prayer, it happened that a certain girl possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by divining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>The same followed Paul and us and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who are announcing to us the way of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>And she did this many days. But being distressed, and turning to the [demonic] spirit, Paul said, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her! And it came out in that hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>And when her masters saw that the hope of their gain went out, having seized Paul and Silas, they dragged [them] to the market before the rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>And bringing them near to the judges, they said, These men, being Jews, are exceedingly troubling our city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>And they teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>And the crowd rose up against them. And tearing off their clothes, the judges ordered [them] to be flogged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>And after laying on them many stripes, they threw [them] into prison, commanding the jailor to keep them safely;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>who, having received such a command, thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>And toward midnight Paul and Silas prayed and praised God in a hymn. And the prisoners listened to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened and all the bonds were loosened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>And being awakened, and seeing the doors of the prison being open, drawing a sword, the jailer was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>Then asking for a light he rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>And leading them outside, he said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved, and your household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>And they spoke the Word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>And taking them in that hour of the night, he washed from [their] stripes. And he was baptized, he and all his, immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>And bringing them up to the house, he set a table before [them] and rejoiced, believing in God with all his household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>And day coming, the judges sent the floggers, saying, Let those men go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>And the jailer spoke these words to Paul: The judges have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart, and go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly, men who are Romans and uncondemned, they threw [us] into prison. And now do they put us out secretly? No indeed! But coming themselves, let them bring us out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>And the floggers reported these words to the judges. And hearing that they were Romans, they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>And coming they begged [them]. And bringing [them] out, [they] asked [them] to depart out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>And going out from the prison, [they] entered into [the house of] Lydia. And seeing the brothers, they comforted them and departed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>And traveling through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>And according to Paul's custom, he went in to them and reasoned with them out of the Scriptures on three sabbaths,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>opening and setting forth that Christ must have suffered, and to have risen again from [the] dead; and that this Jesus whom I preach to you is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>And some of them believed and joined themselves to Paul and Silas, both a great multitude of the worshiping Greeks, and not a few of the chief women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But the disobeying Jews becoming jealous, and having taken aside some wicked men of the market-loafers, and gathering a crowd, they set all the city in an uproar. And coming on the house of Jason, [they] sought to bring them out to the mob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain brothers before the city judges, crying, These who have turned the world upside down have come here too,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>whom Jason has received. And these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>And hearing these things, they troubled the crowd and the city judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>And taking security from Jason and from the rest, they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>And the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. They, when they arrived, went into the synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>And these were more noble than those of Thessalonica, in that [they received] the Word with all readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures daily [to see] if those things [were so].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>Therefore many of them believed, and quite a few of honorable Greek women and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>But when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the Word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>And then immediately the brothers sent Paul away to go towards the sea, but both Silas and Timothy stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>And those conducting Paul brought him to Athens. And receiving a command to Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>But awaiting them in Athens, Paul's spirit was pained within him, seeing the city full of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>Then indeed he addressed the Jews in the synagogue, and those worshiping, and daily in the market, to those happening to be [there].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>And certain philosophers from the Epicureans and from the Stoics met him. And some said, What will this babbler say? And others said, He seems to be an announcer of foreign demons (because he preached Jesus and the resurrection to them).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>And taking hold of him, they led [him] to the Areopagus, saying, Are we able to know what [is] this new doctrine of which you speak?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>For you bring certain strange things to our ears, therefore we are minded to know what these things mean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>(For all the Athenians and strangers who were [there] spent their time in nothing else except to tell or to hear something newer.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>And standing in [the] middle of the Areopagus, Paul said, Men, Athenians, I see that you [are] fearful of gods in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>For [as I] passed by and saw the things you worship, I also found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Not knowing then whom you worship, I make Him known to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of Heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>nor is served with men's hands, [as though] He needed anything, [since] He gives life and breath and all things to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>And He has made all nations of men of one blood to dwell on all the face of the earth, ordaining fore-appointed seasons and boundaries of their dwelling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>to seek the Lord, if perhaps they might feel after Him and find Him, though indeed [He] is not far from each one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>For in Him we live and move and have our being, as also certain of your own poets have said, For we are also His offspring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>Then being offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like gold or silver or stone, engraved by art and man's imagination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>Truly, then, God overlooking the times of ignorance, now He strictly commands all men everywhere to repent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>because He has appointed a day in which He is going to judge the world in righteousness by a Man whom He appointed, having given proof to all [by] raising Him from [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>And hearing [of] a resurrection of [the] dead, some indeed mocked; and others said, We will hear you again concerning this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>And so Paul departed from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>But certain men joined themselves to him and believed; among whom [were] Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>And after these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>And finding a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy [with] his wife Priscilla (because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome) Paul came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>And because [he] was of the same trade, he stayed and worked with them; for they were tentmakers by occupation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>And he reasoned in the synagogue on every sabbath, persuading both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>And when Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the Jews [that] Jesus [is] the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>And they resisting and blaspheming, shaking [his] garment, he said to them, Your blood [is] on your own heads. I [am] pure from [it]. From now on I will go to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>And he departed from there and entered into [the] house of one named Justus, [one] worshiping God, whose house was next to the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house. And hearing this, many of the Corinthians believed and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>And the Lord spoke to Paul in [the] night by a vision, Do not be afraid, but speak, and be not silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>For I am with you, and no one shall set on you to hurt you, for I have many people in this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>And he continued [there] a year and six months, teaching the Word of God among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>But Gallio [being] pro-consul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rushed against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>saying, This one persuades men to worship God contrary to the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>And Paul being about to open [his] mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If indeed then, it was anything wrong or wicked criminality, O Jews, according to reason I would endure you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>But if it is a question of a word and names, and [of] your law, you look [to it]. For I do not wish to be a judge of such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>And he drove them from the judgment seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>And all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat [him] before the judgment seat. And Gallio did not care for any of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>And Paul having remained many days more, taking leave of the brothers, he sailed from there into Syria. And Priscilla and Aquila were with him. And Paul had shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>And he came to Ephesus and left them there. But he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>And they asking [him] to stay a longer time with them, he did not consent</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>but took leave of them, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that is coming in Jerusalem, but I will return again to you, God willing. And he sailed from Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>And when he had landed at Caesarea and had gone up to greet the church, he went down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>And after he had spent some time [there], he departed and went over the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>And a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord. And [being] fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught the things of the Lord diligently, knowing only the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla heard him, and they took him and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>And intending to pass into Achaia, being encouraged, the brothers wrote to the disciples to welcome him; who, having arrived, very much helped those who had believed through grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>For he mightily confuted the Jews publicly, proving by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>And it happened in the [time] Apollos was at Corinth, Paul [was] passing through the higher parts to Ephesus. And finding certain disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>he said to them, Have you received [the] Holy Spirit since you believed? And they said to him, We did not so much as hear whether [the] Holy Spirit is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>And he said to them, Then to what were you baptized? And they said, To John's baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>And Paul said, John truly baptized [with] the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe into Him coming after him, that is, into Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>And hearing, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>And as Paul laid [his] hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>And all of the men were about twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>And going into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>But when some were hardened and did not believe, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>And this happened over two years, so that all those living in Asia heard the Word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>And God did works of power through the hands of Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>so that even handkerchiefs or aprons from his skin being brought onto the sick, the diseases were released, and the evil spirits went out of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>And certain from the strolling Jews, exorcists, undertook to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those having evil spirits, saying, We adjure you [by] Jesus whom Paul preaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>And there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>But answering the evil spirit said, Jesus I know, and I comprehend Paul, but who are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>And the man in whom the evil spirit resided leaped on them, and overcoming them he was strong against them, so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks who lived at Ephesus, and fear fell on all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>And many who believed came and confessed and showed their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>Also many of those practicing the curious arts, bringing together the books, burned [them] before all. And they counted the prices of them and found [it to be] fifty thousand [pieces] of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>So the Word of God grew mightily and prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>After these things were ended, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, Paul purposed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have come there, I must also see Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>And sending into Macedonia two who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he stayed in Asia for a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>And about that time there was not a little a stir about the Way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>For a certain silversmith named Demetrius was making silver temples of Artemis, providing not a little trade [for] the craftsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>And assembling the workmen about such things, he said, Men, you know that from this trade is our wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>And you see and hear that, not only at Ephesus, but almost all Asia, this Paul having persuaded, he has perverted a huge crowd, saying that those which are made with hands are no gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>And not only is this dangerous to us, our share coming into dispute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted for nothing, and her magnificence is also about to be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>And hearing, and becoming full of anger, they cried out, saying, Great [is] Artemis of [the] Ephesians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>And all the city was filled with confusion. And they rushed with one accord to the theater, keeping a firm grip on Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, traveling companions of Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>And Paul intending to go in to the mob, the disciples did not allow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>And some of the chief men of Asia, being his friends, sent to him, begging [him] not to give himself into the theater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>Then indeed others cried out, some other things; for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>And they dragged Alexander forward out of the crowd, the Jews thrusting him forward. And waving [his] hand Alexander desired to defend himself to the mob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice cried out for two hours' [time], Great [is] Artemis of [the] Ephesians!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>And quieting the crowd, the town clerk said, Men, Ephesians! What one of you does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Artemis, and of That Fallen from the Sky?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>Since these things cannot be spoken against, you ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>For you have brought these men, who are neither robbers of churches nor blasphemers of your goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>Therefore if Demetrius and those craftsmen with him truly have a matter against anyone, the court days are [kept], and there are proconsuls. Let them plead against one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>But if you ask anything concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>For we are in danger to be accused of revolt concerning today; there being no cause by which we may give an account of this crowding together.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>And after the uproar had ceased, calling the disciples and greeting [them], Paul left to go into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>And passing through those parts, and exhorting them with much speech, he came into Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>And spending three months [there], there [being] a plot against him by the Jews, being about to sail into Syria, he proposed to return through Macedonia.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>And after the days of Unleavened [Bread], we sailed away from Philippi and came to them at Troas [in] five days, where we stayed seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>And on the first of the sabbaths, the disciples having been assembled to break bread, being about to depart on the morrow, Paul reasoned to them. And he continued his speech until midnight.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>And a certain young man named Eutychus [was] sitting on the window sill, Paul reasoning for a longer time, being overborne by sleep, he fell down from the third floor, and was taken up dead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>[and] how I kept back nothing that was profitable, but have shown you and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.21.4'>And finding disciples, we stayed there seven days; who said to Paul through the Spirit that he should not go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.5'>But when it was [time to] finish the days, going out, we traveled on. [And they] with all [the] women and children went with us as far as outside the city. And we kneeled down on the shore and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.6'>And giving parting greetings to one another, we went up into the ship; and they returned to their own things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.7'>And finishing the voyage from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais. And greeting the brothers, we stayed with them one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.8'>And the next [day] those around [him] going out, Paul came to Caesarea. And entering the house of Philip the evangelist, [he] being of the seven, we stayed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.9'>And there were four virgin daughters to this one, who prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.10'>And as we stayed more days, a certain prophet from Judea named Agabus came down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.11'>And coming to us, and taking Paul's belt, and binding his hands and feet, he said, The Holy Spirit says these [things]: So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man whose belt this is, and will deliver [him] into the hands of  the] nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.12'>And when we heard these things, both we and those of [the] place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.13'>Then Paul answered, What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>And he not being persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be [done].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>And after those days, making ready, we went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>Also [some] of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing Mnason, a certain Cypriot, an old disciple with whom we were to lodge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.17'>And we being in Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>And on the next [day] Paul went with us to James. And all the elders were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>And having greeted them, he related one by one what things God had done among the nations by his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>And hearing, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who believe, and they are all zealous of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>And they are informed concerning you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the nations to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise [their] children, nor to walk after the customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>What is it therefore? At all events a multitude will come together, for they will hear that you have come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>Therefore do this, what we say to you: We have four men who have a vow on themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>taking them, be purified with them, and be at expense for them, so that they may shave [their] heads. And all may know that what they have been told about you is nothing, but you yourself also walk orderly and keep the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>And as to the nations who believe, we joined in writing, judging them to observe no such things, except only that they keep themselves from both idol sacrifice, and blood, and a thing strangled, and [from] fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then taking the men on the next day, being purified with them, Paul went into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of the purification, until an offering should be offered for each of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>And when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews who were from Asia, having seen him in the temple, stirred up all the crowd and laid hands on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>crying out, Men, Israelites, help! This is the man who teaches all everywhere against the people and the Law and this place. And even he brought Greeks into the temple and has polluted this holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>(For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city before, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>And all the city was moved, and the people ran together. And laying hands on Paul, they drew him outside of the temple. And immediately the doors were shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>And as they [were] seeking to kill him, the news came to the chiliarch of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>[He] immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And seeing the chiliarch and the soldiers, they quit beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>Then going near, the chiliarch laid hold on him, and commanded [him] to be bound with two chains. And [he] demanded who he was and what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>And others cried something else in the crowd, and not being able to know the certainty on account of the uproar, he commanded him to be carried into the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>And when he came on the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers, because of the violence of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>And as Paul was about to be led into the fortress, he said to the chiliarch, Is it lawful for me to say a thing to you? And he said, Do you know Greek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>Then are you not the Egyptian who before these days caused a riot, and led four thousand men of the assassins out into the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>But Paul said, I am a man, a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen [of] no small city. And I beseech you, allow me to speak to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>And he allowing him, standing on the stairs, Paul signaled with [his] hand to the people. And much silence taking place, he spoke in the Hebrew dialect, saying:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>Men, brothers and fathers! Hear my defense now to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>And hearing that he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, they all the more kept silence. And he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>I am truly a man, a Jew born in Tarsus in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the exactness of the law of the fathers, being a zealous one of God, as you all are today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>[I] persecuted this Way as far as death, binding and delivering both men and women into prisons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>as also the high priest bears witness to me, and all the elderhood. And receiving letters from [them] to the brothers, I traveled into Damascus indeed to lead those being bound to Jerusalem, in order that they might be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>And it happened to me, traveling and drawing near to Damascus: suddenly, about midday, a great light out of the heaven shone around me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>And I answered, Who are you, lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>And they who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid. But they did not hear the voice of Him who spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise and go into Damascus. And there it shall be told you all things which are appointed for you to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>And I did not see, because of the glory of that light; being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, testified to by all the Jews who lived [there] ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>coming to me and standing by, said to me, Brother Saul, look up! And the same hour I looked up on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you to know His will and to see the Just One, and to hear a voice out of His mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>For you shall be His witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>And now what do you intend? Arise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>And it happened to me, I returning to Jerusalem and praying in the temple, I became in an ecstasy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>And I saw Him say to me, Hurry and go quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive your testimony concerning Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>And I said, Lord, they know that I was imprisoning and beating those who believed on You throughout the synagogues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>And when the blood of Your martyr Stephen was poured out, I also was standing by and consenting to his death, and holding the garments of those who killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>And He said to me, Go, for I will send you far away to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>And they listened to him until this word, and [then] they lifted up their voice, saying, Take such a one from the earth! For it is not fitting that he should live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>And as they shouted and tore [their] garments, and threw dust into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the chiliarch commanded him to be brought into the fortress, saying for him to be examined by scourging, so that he might know why they cried out so against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>And as they stretched him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>And hearing, coming near the centurion reported to the chiliarch, saying, Watch what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>And coming up the chiliarch said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? And He said, Yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>And the chiliarch answered, With a great sum I bought this citizenship. And Paul said, But I was even born [free].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>Then immediately, those being about to examine him stood away from him. And the chiliarch also was afraid, fully knowing that he was a Roman, and that he had bound him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>On the next day, he desiring to know with certainty why he was accused by the Jews, he freed him from [his] bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their sanhedrin to appear. And bringing Paul down, [he] set [him among them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>And looking earnestly on the sanhedrin, Paul said, Men, brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>Then Paul said to him, God shall strike you, whitened wall! For do you sit judging me according to the Law, and against law command me to be stricken?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>And they who stood by him said, Do you revile God's high priest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>Then Paul said, I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest; for it is written, You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>But when Paul saw that the one part were Sadducees and the other part Pharisees, he cried out in the sanhedrin, Men! Brothers! I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee! I am being judged because of the hope and resurrection of [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>And there arose a great cry. And the scribes [who were] on the Pharisees' side arose and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>And dissension arising, the chiliarch, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him from among them by force, and to bring [him] into the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>And the following night the Lord stood by him and said, Be of good cheer, Paul, for as you have testified of Me in Jerusalem, so you also must bear witness at Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>And when [it] became day, some of the Jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>And they who made this conspiracy were more than forty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>And they came to the chief priests and elders and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>Now therefore you, with the sanhedrin, inform the chiliarch that he bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you would inquire something more perfectly regarding him. And we are ready to put him to death before he comes near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>And hearing of the ambush, Paul's sister's son, having come near, and entering into the fortress, he reported to Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>And calling one of the centurions, Paul said, Bring this young man to the chiliarch, for he has a certain thing to tell him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>So he took him and brought [him] to the chiliarch and said, Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to say to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>And laying hold of his hand, and drawing aside privately, the chiliarch asked [him], What is [it] that you have to tell me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the sanhedrin tomorrow, as though they would inquire something more exactly about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>But do not yield to them, for there are more than forty men of them lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him. And now they are ready, looking for a promise from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>So the chiliarch sent away the young man commanding, Tell no one that you have shown these things to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>And he called two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>And provide animals, so that they may set Paul on them and bring [him] to Felix the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>And he wrote a letter in this way:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>This man was taken by the Jews and would have been killed by them. Then I came with an army and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>And being minded to know the charge for which they accused him, I brought him down to their sanhedrin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>whom I found be accused of questions of their law, and having no charge worthy of death or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>And it being revealed to me that a plot against the man was about to be [executed] by the Jews, I immediately sent him to you, commanding his accusers also to say before you what [they had] against him. Farewell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>Then, indeed, taking up Paul, as it was commanded them, the soldiers brought [him] by night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>And on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>And when they had come to Caesarea and had delivered the letter to the governor, [they] presented Paul before him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>And when the governor had read [the letter], he asked what province he was from. And when he understood that [he was] from Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>he said, I will hear you when your accusers have also come. And [he] commanded him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders and [with] a certain orator, Tertullus, who made a statement to the governor against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>And being called, Tertullus began to accuse, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>Since we enjoy great quietness by you, and very worthy deeds are done to this nation due to your forethought, in everything and everywhere, most noble Felix, we accept with all thankfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>But that I not hinder you further, I beseech you to hear us briefly in your fairness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>For we have found this man pestilent, and moving rebellion among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>who also attempted to profane the temple, whom we took and would have judged according to our law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>But the chiliarch Lysias came with much force, taking [him] away out of our hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him, you yourself may know about all these things of which we accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>But the governor motioning to him to speak, Paul answered; Understanding you as being a judge of this nation many years, I cheerfully defend myself [as to] the things concerning myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>You can know that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, nor making a gathering of a crowd; not even in the synagogues, nor throughout the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>But I confess this to you, that after the Way which they call heresy, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things that are written in the Law and in the Prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>And I have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of [the] dead, both of the just and unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>And in this I exercise myself, always to have a blameless conscience toward God and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>And after many years I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>Among which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a crowd nor with tumult.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>These ought to be present before you and to accuse me, if they have anything against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>Or else let these themselves say if they have found anything unjust in me while I stood before the sanhedrin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>unless it may be for this one voice that I cried out standing among them, that concerning a resurrection of [the] dead I am being judged by you today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>And having heard these things, Felix put them off, knowing more accurately of the Way, saying, When Lysias the chiliarch has come down, I will examine the things concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul and to let [him] have liberty, and not to forbid anyone of his own to minister or come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>Then after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and the Judgment to come, Felix trembled and answered, Go for this time, but taking time later, I will call for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>He also hoped that silver would be given him by Paul, that he might free him. Therefore [he] also frequently sent for him [and] talked with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>But after two years Felix welcomed a successor, Porcius Festus. And wishing to show a favor to the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Then entering the province, after three days Festus went from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>And the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and they begged him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>asking a favor against him that he would send for him to Jerusalem, making a plot to kill him on way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>Then indeed Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea; he himself would depart shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>Then he said, those having power among you may go down with [me]. If there is a thing amiss in this man, let them accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>And staying among them more than ten days, going down to Caesarea, on the next day sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>And he having come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood around and brought many charges against Paul, which they could not prove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>Defending himself, [Paul] said, Neither against the Law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended in anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>But Festus, wanting to please the Jews, answered Paul and said, Will you go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before me about these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>But Paul said, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you very well know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>For if I am an offender or have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die. But if there is nothing of which these accuse me, no one can deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>Then conferring with the sanhedrin, Festus answered, You have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>And after some days king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause to the king, saying, A certain man has been left in bonds by Felix,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>about whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed [me], desiring judgment against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>To them I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man to destruction before he being accused may have the accusers face to face, and have had freedom to answer for himself concerning the accusation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>Therefore, when they had come here, without any delay I sat on the judgment seat the next [day] and commanded the man to be brought,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>about whom, standing up, the accusers brought against him no charge of which I suspected,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>but they had certain questions about [their] own demon-worship, and about a certain Jesus dying, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>And because I was perplexed about this question, I asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and be judged there about these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But Paul having appealed to be reserved to the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be held until I might send him to Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>And Agrippa said to Festus, I also would like to hear the man myself. And he said, Tomorrow you shall hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>And on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp and had entered into the auditorium with both the chiliarchs and principal men of the city, also Festus commanding, Paul was brought out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all those men present with us, you see this one about whom all the multitude of the Jews pleaded with me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>But I had perceived nothing he had committed worthy of death, and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I determined to send him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>about whom I have no certain thing to write of him to [my] lord. Therefore I brought him before you, and especially before you, O king Agrippa, so that, after examination is made, I might have something to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to signify the charges against him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>And Agrippa said to Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then stretching out his hand, Paul made a defense:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>Concerning all of which I am accused by Jews, king Agrippa, I think myself happy being about to make defense before you today,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>you being especially expert in all customs and questions among the Jews. Therefore I beseech you to hear me patiently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>Truly, then, all the Jews know my manner of life from my youth, which was at first among my own nation at Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>who knew me from the first, if they would testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>And now I stand and am judged for [the] hope of the promise made to our fathers by God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>to which [promise] our twelve tribes hope to attain, serving God fervently night and day. For the sake of this hope, king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>Why is it thought a thing incredible with you that God raises [the] dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>I truly thought within myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>which I also did in Jerusalem. And I shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests. And they being put to death, I cast a vote.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>And I punished them often in every synagogue; I compelled [them] to blaspheme; and [being] exceedingly furious against them, I persecuted them even to the outside cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>In which pursuit also traveling to Damascus with authority and power of decision from the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>at midday, along the highway, O king, I and those with me saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun; shining around me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>And all of us falling to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me? [It is] hard for you to kick against the goads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>And I said, Who are you, lord? And He said, I am Jesus whom you persecute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>But rise and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of what you saw, and in what I shall appear to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>delivering you from the people and the nations, to whom I now send you</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>in order to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the authority of Satan to God, so that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>After this, king Agrippa, I did not disobey the heavenly vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>But to those first in Damascus, and Jerusalem, and to all the country of Judea, and to the nations, I made known [the command] to repent and to turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>Because of these things, having caught [me] in the temple, The Jews tried to kill [me].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>Then having obtained help from God, I stand until this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said was going to happen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>whether the Christ was] liable to suffer, whether first by a resurrection of the] dead He was going to proclaim light to the people and to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>And he defending himself [with] these things, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you rave! Your many letters turn [you] to insanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>But he said, Not to insanity, most noble Festus, but I speak words of truth and sanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>For the king understands about these things, to whom I speak, even being bold of speech. For I am persuaded that not any of these things are hidden [from] him, nothing. For the doing of this was not in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>And Agrippa said to Paul, Do you persuade me to be a Christian in [but] a little?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>And Paul said, I would pray to God, both in a little and in much, that not only you, but also all hearing me today to become as I also am, except for these bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>And he having spoken this, the king and the governor and Bernice and those who sat with them rose up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>And withdrawing, they spoke with one another, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>And when it was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to [one] named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' cohort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>And boarding a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail alongside Asian places, we set sail, Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, being with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>And on the next [day] we were landed at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul courteously and gave [him] liberty to go to his friends to receive care.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>And setting sail from there, we sailed close to Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>And sailing over the sea against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra of Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy, and he put us on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>And sailing slowly many days and with difficulty, coming abreast of Cnidus; the wind not allowing us; we sailed close to Crete, across from Salmone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>And coasting along with difficulty, we came to a place named Fair Havens, near which was a city, Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>And much time having been used up, and the voyage already being dangerous, because the Fast was now already past, Paul warned [them] ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>saying, Men, I perceive that this voyage is about to be with much harm and loss, and not only much cargo and of the ship, but also of our souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But the centurion was rather persuaded by the helmsman and the shipmaster, than by the things spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>And the port not being fit to winter in, the most of them advised to set sail from there, if by any means they might be able to get to Phoenix to winter; [which is] a port of Crete, looking toward [the] southwest and northwest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>And a south wind blowing softly, thinking to have obtained [their] purpose, lifting [anchor], they sailed along close beside Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But not long after, a stormy wind called Euroclydon beat down [on] it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>And the ship being seized, and not being able to beat against the wind, giving way we were borne along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>And running under an islet being called Clauda, we hardly were able to become masters of the boat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>which taking, they used helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they should fall into the sandbanks of Syrtis, lowering the tackle, so they were borne along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>And being exceedingly storm-tossed with a tempest, they made a casting on the next [day] ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>And on the third [day] we threw out the ship's tackle with our hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>And neither sun nor stars appearing in many days, and no small tempest pressing hard, now all hope that we would be saved was taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>But there being much fasting, then standing up in their midst, Paul said, O men, being obedient to me [you] ought not to have set sail from Crete, and to have come by this harm and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>And now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there will be no casting away of life among you, only of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>For tonight an angel of God stood beside me, whose I am and whom I serve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>saying, Fear not, Paul! You must stand before Caesar. And behold! God has given you all those who sail with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>Therefore, men, be of good cheer, for I believe God, that it will be so, according to the way it was told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>But we must fall on a certain island.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>But when [the] fourteenth night came, we being carried about in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors thought that they drew near some country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>And sounding they found it twenty fathoms; and moving a little further, and sounding again, they found [it] fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>And fearing that we would fall on rocks, and casting four anchors out of [the] stern, they wished day to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>But the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and lowering the boat into the sea, pretending to be about to cast out anchors from [the] prow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the boat, and let her fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>And until day was about to come, Paul begged all to take food, saying, This [is] the fourteenth day that you continued waiting without food, having taken nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>Therefore I beg you to take [some] food, for this is for your deliverance. For not a hair of your head shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>And saying these things, and taking bread, he gave thanks to God before all, and breaking, he began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>And all becoming cheered, they also took food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>And we were, all the souls in the ship, two hundred and seventy-six.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>And being filled [with] food, they lightened the ship, throwing the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>And when day came, they did not recognize the land. But they discovered a certain bay with a beach, into which they were minded, if they were able, to drive the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>And casting off the anchors, they left [them] in the sea; at the same time they loosened the rudder bands and hoisted up the foresail to the wind and held to the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>And coming on a place between two seas, they drove the vessel. And indeed the prow sticking fast, [it] remained unmovable. But the stern was broken with the violence of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>And the mind of the soldiers was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out and escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, kept them from [their] purpose and commanded those who could swim, to throw [themselves] overboard, to go out on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>And the rest [went], some on boards and others on some of the things from the ship. And so it happened that all were saved on the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>And being saved, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>And the foreigners showed us not the common kindness. For they kindled a fire and welcomed all of us, because of the rain coming on, and because of the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>And Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laying [them] on the fire, a viper came out of the heat and fastened on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>And when the foreigners saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, being saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>Then indeed he shook off the creature into the fire, suffering no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>But they expected him to be about to become inflamed, or to fall down dead suddenly, But over much [time] expecting and seeing nothing amiss happening to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>In the [quarters] about that place were lands to the chief of the island, whose name was Publius. Welcoming us, [he] lodged us courteously three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>And it happened the father of Publius was lying down, suffering fevers and dysentery; to whom Paul entered in, and praying and laying on his hands, he healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>Then this taking place, the rest who were having infirmities in the island also came, and were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>[They] also honored us with many honors. And on [our] setting sail, they laid on the things of [our] needs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>And after three months we sailed in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, an Alexandrian with an ensign, The Twin Brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>And landing at Syracuse, we stayed three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>Going around from there we arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a south wind coming on, we came to Puteoli on the second,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>where finding brothers, we were asked to stay seven days. And so we went toward Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>And the brothers from there hearing of us, [they] came to meet us as far as [the] market-place of Appius, and Three Taverns. Seeing them, thanking God, Paul took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>And when we came into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the camp commander. But Paul was allowed to dwell by himself, with a soldier guarding him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>And after three days it happened that Paul called together those being chief of the Jews. And they coming together, he said to them, Men, brothers, I did nothing against the people or customs of our fathers. I was delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>who, examining me, were of a mind to let [me] go because there was no cause of death in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But the Jews speaking against [it], I was constrained to appeal to Caesar; not as having anything to accuse my nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>For this cause, then, I called for you, to see and to speak with [you]. For I have this chain around me for the hope of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>And they said to him, We neither received letters out of Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brothers who came declared or spoke anything evil of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we think [it] right to hear from you what you think. For truly as concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>And they having appointed him a day, many came to him in [his] lodging; to whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them the things concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses and out of the prophets, from morning until evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>And some indeed believed the things that were said, others did not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>And disagreeing with one another, they were let go, Paul saying one word: Well did the Holy Spirit speak through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>saying, Go to this people and say: Hearing you shall hear and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see and not perceive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>For the heart of this people was fattened, and they have heard with their ears dully; and they closed their eyes; lest at any time they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and understand with [their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>Therefore be it known to you that the salvation of God is sent to the nations, and they will hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.29'>And he having said these words, the Jews departed, having much discussion amongst themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>And Paul remained two years in his own hired house. And he welcomed all who came in to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching those things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom, [and] without hindrance.</verse>
