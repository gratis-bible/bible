Eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that roll.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And He said to me, Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your belly with this roll that I give you. Then I ate [it]; and in my mouth it was like honey for sweetness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And He said to me, Son of man, go! Go up to the house of Israel and speak to them with My words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For you [are] not sent to a people of a deep lip and of a difficult language, [but] to the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>not to many people of a deep lip and of a difficult language, whose words you cannot hear. Surely, if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the house of Israel will not listen to you, for they will not listen to Me; for all the house of Israel [are] strong of forehead and hard of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces and your forehead strong against their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I have made your forehead as an adamant harder than flint. Do not be bowed down by their faces, though they [are] a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He said to me, Son of man, receive all My words which I shall speak to you in your heart, and hear with your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And go! Go to those of the captivity, to the sons of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, So says the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear or whether they will forbear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a sound of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed [be] the glory of the LORD from His place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>[I] also [heard] the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching one another, and the sound of the wheels along with them, and a sound of a great rushing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then I came to the exiles at Tel-at-abib, who lived by the river Chebar. And I sat [where] they sat; and I also dwelt seven days, being stricken dumb among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it happened at the end of seven days, even it happened [that] the Word of the LORD [came] to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word of My mouth, and give them warning from Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; and you do not give him warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked one shall die in his iniquity; but I will require his blood at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and when I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if you warn the righteous so that the righteous does not sin, and if he does not sin, he shall surely live because he is warned; also you have delivered your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the hand of the LORD was on me there. And He said to me, Arise, go out into the plain, and I will talk with you there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then I arose and went out into the plain; and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar. And I fell on my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet; and spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut yourself inside your house!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But you, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands on you and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be dumb and shall not be one who warns them. For they [are] a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: He who hears, let him hear; and he who stops his ears, let him stop; for they [are] a rebellious house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
