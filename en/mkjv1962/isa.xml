      <chapter osisID='Isa.1'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the LORD has spoken, I have nursed and brought up sons, and they have rebelled against Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib; [but] Israel does not know; My people do not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>Woe, sinful nation, a people heavy [with] iniquity, a seed of evildoers, sons who corrupt! They have forsaken the LORD; they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger; they have gone away backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>Why should you be stricken any more? You will revolt more and more; the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the sole of the foot even to the head [there is] no soundness in it; [only] a wound and a stripe and a fresh blow; they have not been closed, nor bound up, nor soothed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your land [is] wasted, your cities burned with fire. Strangers devour your land right before your eyes, and [it is] wasted, as overthrown by strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>And the daughter of Zion is left a booth in a vineyard, like a hut in a garden of cucumbers, like a besieged city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>Except the LORD of hosts had left us a very small remnant, we would be as Sodom; we would be like Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Hear the Word of the LORD, rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, people of Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>To what purpose [is] the multitude of your sacrifices to Me? says the LORD; I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I do not delight in [the blood of] bulls, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand, to trample My courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>Bring no more vain sacrifice; incense is an abomination to Me; the new moon and sabbath, the going to meeting; I cannot endure evil and the assembly!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>Your new moons and your appointed feasts My soul hates; they are a trouble to Me; I am weary to bear [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>And when you spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you; yea, when you make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes; cease to do evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>learn to do good; seek judgment, reprove the oppressor. Judge the orphan, plead for the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>Come now, and let us reason together, says the LORD; though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be like wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'>If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'>but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured [with] the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'>How has the faithful city become a harlot? [It was] full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it, but now murderers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>your rulers [are] rebellious, and companions of thieves; everyone loves a bribe, and is pursuing rewards; they do not judge the orphan, nor does the cause of the widow come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>And the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, the mighty One of Israel, says, Alas! I will ease Myself of My foes, and avenge Myself of My enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>And I will turn back My hand on you, and purge away your dross as with lye, and take away all your alloy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>And I will restore your judges as at first, and your counselors as at the beginning; afterwards you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her returning ones with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>And the downfall of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together; and those who forsake the LORD [shall be] consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be ashamed for the gardens which you have chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>For you shall be like an oak whose leaf fades, and like a garden that has no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>And the strong shall be like tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall put [them] out.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'>The Word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'>And it shall be, in the last days the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'>And many people shall go and say, Come, and let us go to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. And He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths. For out of Zion shall go out the Law, and the Word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>And He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>O house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>For You have forsaken Your people the house of Jacob, because they have become full from the east, and [are] fortune-tellers like the Philistines. And they clap their [hands] with the children of strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'>And their land is full of silver and gold. [There is] no end of their treasures and their land is full of horses; nor an end of their chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>And their land is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>And the man bowed down, and man was humbled, but You do not lift them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Enter into the rock and hide in the dust for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of His majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the pride of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>For the day of the LORD of hosts [shall be] on every proud and lofty one, and on every lifted up one; and he [shall be] brought low,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>And it shall be on all the high and lifted up cedars of Lebanon, and on all the oaks of Bashan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>and on all the high mountains, and on all the lifted up hills;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>and on every high tower, and on every fortified wall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>and on all the ships of Tarshish, and on all pleasurable craft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'>And the pride of man shall be bowed down, and the loftiness of men shall be made low; and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'>And the idols shall completely vanish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'>And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth for fear of the LORD and for the glory of His majesty, when He arises to shake the earth terribly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'>In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made for him to worship, to the moles and to the bats;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'>to go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD and for the glory of His majesty, when He arises to shake the earth terribly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'>Cease from man, whose breath [is] in his nostril; for in what is he to be esteemed?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'>For behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'>the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'>the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the adviser, and the skilled worker, and the expert charmer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'>And I will give young boys [to be] their rulers, and caprices shall rule over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'>And the people shall be crushed, every man by another, and every man by his neighbor; the boy shall act proudly against the old man, and the low against the honorable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'>When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, [saying], You have clothing, you be our ruler, and let this ruin be under your hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'>in that day he shall swear, saying, I will not be a healer; there [is] no bread nor a cloak in my house. You shall not make me a ruler of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'>For Jerusalem is ruined and Judah has fallen; because their tongue and their doings [are] against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of His glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'>The look of their faces witnesses against them; and they declare their sin like Sodom. They do not hide [it]! Woe to their soul! For they have rewarded evil to themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'>Say to the righteous that [it is] well; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'>Woe to the wicked! For the evil doing of his hand will be done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>[As for] my people, children [are] their taskmasters, and women rule over them. Oh my people, your rulers cause [you] to go astray and destroy the way of your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'>The LORD stands up to plead His case, and stands up to judge the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'>The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders of His people, and their kings; for you have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor [is] in your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'>What do you mean? You crush My people and grind the faces of the poor? says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'>And the LORD says, Because the daughters of Zion are proud, and have walked with stretched out necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing [as] they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'>therefore the LORD will strike with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will make their secret parts naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'>In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of ankle-bracelets, and the headbands, and the crescents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'>the pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'>the headdresses, and the leg ornaments, and the sashes, and the houses of the soul, and the amulets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'>the rings and nose jewels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.22'>the festal apparel and the outer garments; and the mantles, and the purses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'>the mirrors and the fine linen; and the turbans and the veils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'>And it shall be, instead of sweet smell, there shall be an odor of decay; and instead of a sash, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a rich robe, a wrapping of sackcloth; burning instead of beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'>Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'>And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall sit deserted on the ground.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'>And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, we will eat our own bread and wear our own clothing; only let us be called by your name, to take away our shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'>In that day shall the Branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth excellent and comely for those who have escaped from Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'>And it shall be, he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.4'>when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from its midst by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.5'>And the LORD will create over all the site of Mount Zion, and on her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for on all the glory [shall be] a defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.6'>And there shall be a booth for a shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge, and for a hiding place from storm and rain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'>Now I will sing to my Beloved a song of my Beloved concerning His vineyard. My Beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'>And He fenced it, and gathered out the stones of it, and planted it [with] choice vines, and built a tower in its midst, and hewed out a wine vat in it; and He looked [for it] to produce grapes. And it produced wild grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'>And now, O people of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, please judge between Me and My vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'>What more could have been done to my vineyard that I have not done in it? Who knows? I looked [for it] to yield grapes, but it yielded rotten grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'>And now I will tell you what I will do to My vineyard; I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up; [and] break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'>and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor dug; but briers and thorns shall come up. And I will command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'>For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts [is] the house of Israel, and the men of Judah His pleasant plant; and He looked for justice, but behold bloody iniquity; for righteousness, but behold a cry!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'>Woe [to] those who join house to house, laying field to field, until the end of space, and you are made to dwell alone in the middle of the land!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'>The LORD of hosts [swore] in my ears, Truly many houses shall be deserted, big and fair, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'>Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'>Woe to those who rise up early in the morning to go after strong drink; tarrying in the twilight [while] wine inflames them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'>And the lyre, and the harp, the timbrel, and pipe, and wine, are [at] their feasts; but they do not regard the work of the LORD. Yea, they do not see the work of His hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'>For this My people go into exile without knowledge, and their honorable men into famine, and his multitude is dried up with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'>So hell has enlarged itself, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their pride, and he who rejoices in her, shall go down into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'>And man is bowed down, and man is humbled and the eyes of the lofty are humbled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'>But the LORD of hosts is exalted in judgment, and God the holy One is sanctified in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'>Then shall the lambs feed in their way, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'>Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin with cart ropes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'>who say, Let Him hurry [and] hasten His work, so that we may see it; and let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, so that we may know!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.20'>Woe to those who call evil good and good evil; who put darkness for light and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.21'>Woe to those wise in their own eyes, and bright in their own sight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.22'>Woe to those mighty to drink wine, and brave men to mix strong drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'>who justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'>So, as the fire devours the stubble, and the flame burns up the chaff; their root shall be like rottenness, and their blossoms shall go up like dust, because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the Word of the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'>Therefore the anger of the LORD is kindled on His people, and He has stretched out His hand against them, and has stricken them; and the hills trembled, and their dead bodies [were] as filth in the midst of the streets. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand [is] stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'>And He will lift up a banner to distant nations, and will hiss to them from the ends of the earth; and behold, they shall come [with] swift speed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'>None [shall be] weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the waistcoat of their loins be loosened, nor the thong of their sandals be broken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'>whose arrows [are] sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses' hoofs seem like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'>Their roaring [shall be] like a lion; they shall roar like young lions; for, they shall roar and lay hold of the prey, and carry [it] away safe, and none shall deliver [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'>And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea; and [one] looks to the land, behold darkness, and lo, darkness! Distress! And the light shall be darkened by its clouds.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'>In the year that king Uzziah died I then saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'>Above it stood the seraphs; each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.3'>And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, [is] the LORD of hosts; the whole earth full of His glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.4'>And the doorposts moved at the voice of the one who cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.5'>Then I said, Woe [is] me! For I am undone; for I [am] a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.6'>Then one of the seraphs flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, snatched with tongs from the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.7'>And he laid [it] on my mouth and said, Lo, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.8'>And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here [am] I; send me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.9'>And He said, Go, and tell this people, You hear indeed, but do not understand; and seeing you see, but do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.10'>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn back, and be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.11'>Then I said, Lord, how long? And He answered, Until the cities are wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land laid waste, a desolation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.12'>and [until] the LORD has moved men far away, and the desolation in the midst of the land [is] great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.13'>But yet in it [shall be] a tenth, and [it] shall return and be consumed like the terebinth and like the oak being felled, [yet has] its stump; the holy seed [is] its stump.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.7.1'>And it happened in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not overcome it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.2'>And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is allied with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the woods are moved by the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.3'>Then the LORD said to Isaiah, Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the Fuller's Field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.4'>And say to him, Be careful and be quiet. Do not fear, nor be timid of heart because of the two tails of these smoking firebrands, because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.5'>because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted against you, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.6'>Let us go up against Judah and trouble it, and break her for ourselves, and set a king in the midst of it, the son of Tabeal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.7'>So says the Lord God, It shall not stand, nor shall it come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.8'>For the head of Syria [is] Damascus, and the head of Damascus [is] Rezin; and within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken so that it shall not be a people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.9'>And the head of Ephraim [is] Samaria, and the head of Samaria [is] Remaliah's son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.10'>And the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.11'>Ask a sign of the LORD your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.12'>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, nor will I tempt the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.13'>And He said, Hear now, O house of David; [is it] a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.14'>So, the Lord Himself shall give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call His name Immanuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.15'>Butter and honey he shall eat until he knows to refuse the evil and choose the good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.16'>For before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that you loathe shall be forsaken before both its kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.17'>The LORD shall bring on you, and on your people, and on your father's house, days that have not come, since the days that Ephraim departed from Judah, the king of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.18'>And it shall be, in that day the LORD shall hiss for the fly at the end of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that [is] in the land of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.19'>And they shall come and all of them shall rest in the desert valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and on all thorns, and on all the pastures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.20'>In the same day the Lord shall shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by those Beyond the River, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet; and it shall also sweep away the beard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.21'>And it shall be, in that day a man shall keep alive a young cow and two sheep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.22'>and it will be, from the plentiful supply of milk they shall give, he shall eat butter; for butter and honey shall everyone eat who is left in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.23'>And it shall be, in that day every place where there were a thousand vines, [worth] a thousand pieces of silver, [it] shall even be for briers and thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.24'>With arrows and with the bow [men] shall come there, because all the land shall become briers and thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.25'>And all hills which were hoed with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending out of the ox, and for the trampling of sheep.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.8'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.1'>And the LORD said to me, Take a great scroll and write in it with a man's pen: Make Haste [to] Plunder! Hasten to the Prey!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.2'>And I took to myself faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.3'>And I went to the prophetess. And she conceived and bore a son. Then the LORD said to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz [Make Haste to Plunder].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.4'>For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.5'>The LORD also spoke to me again saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.6'>Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.7'>And therefore, behold, the Lord brings on them the waters of the River, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory. And he shall come up over all his channels and go over all his banks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.8'>And he shall pass through Judah. He shall overflow and go over; he shall reach to the neck. And the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.9'>Suffer evil, O people, and be broken! And give ear, all from the far places of the earth. Gird yourselves and be broken. Gird yourselves and be broken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.10'>Counsel a counsel, and it is frustrated. Speak a word, and it shall not stand; for God [is] with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.11'>For so the LORD spoke to me with a strong hand, and warned me against walking in the way of this people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.12'>Do not say, A conspiracy! to everything of which this people says, A conspiracy! And do not fear their fear, nor be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.13'>Sanctify the LORD of hosts Himself, and [let] Him [be] your fear, and let Him be your dread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.14'>And He shall be a sanctuary for you, but for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of falling to both the houses of Israel, for a trap and for a snare to the people of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.15'>And many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.16'>Bind up the testimony, seal the law among My disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.17'>And I will wait on the LORD, who hides His face from the house of Jacob; and I will look for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.18'>Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me [are] for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells in Mount Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.19'>And when they shall say to you, Seek to the mediums and to wizards who peep and mutter; should not a people seek to their God, [than] for the living to the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.20'>To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this Word, [it is] because no light [is] in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.21'>And they shall pass through it, hard-pressed and hungry; and it shall be, they shall be hungry; They shall rave and curse their king and their God, and look upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.22'>And they shall look to the land; and behold, trouble and darkness and gloom of anguish! And they [are] driven away into darkness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.9'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.1'>Yet there [will be] no gloom for her who [was] in anguish, [as in] the former time. He degraded the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, so afterwards He will glorify the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.2'>The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; they who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, on them the light has shined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.3'>You have multiplied the nation. You have not increased the joy. They rejoice before You according to the joy in harvest, and [as men] rejoice when they divide the spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.4'>For You have broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his taskmaster, as [in] the day of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.5'>For every boot of the warrior [is] with commotion, and the coat rolled in blood shall be burning fuel for the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.6'>For to us a Child is born, to us a Son is given; and the government shall be on His shoulder; and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.7'>There is no end of the increase of [His] government and peace on the throne of David, and on His kingdom, to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from now on, even forever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.8'>The Lord sent a word to Jacob, and it has fallen on Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.9'>And all the people shall know, Ephraim and the people of Samaria, who say in pride and hardness of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.10'>The bricks have fallen down, but we will build [with] cut stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we use cedars instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.11'>And the LORD shall set up the foes of Rezin against him, and spur on his enemies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.12'>the Syrians in front and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand [is] stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.13'>For the people do not turn to Him who strikes them, nor do they seek the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.14'>And the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, [in] one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.15'>The elder and honorable, he is the head; and the prophet who teaches lies, he [is] the tail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.16'>For the leaders of this people led [them] astray; and their guided ones [are] swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.17'>For this the Lord shall not rejoice over their young men, nor shall He have mercy on their orphans and widows; for everyone [is] a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks foolishness. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand [is] stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.18'>For wickedness burns like the fire; it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall roll upwards [like] the lifting up of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.19'>Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land scorched, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire; no man shall have pity on his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.20'>And [he shall] cut off on the right hand and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left, and they shall not be satisfied. Each man shall eat the flesh of his own arm;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.21'>Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; [and] they together [shall be] against Judah. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.10'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.1'>Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and to the scribes [who] write toil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.2'>to turn aside the needy from judgment, and to steal the right from the poor of My people, that widows may be their prey, and they rob the orphans!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.3'>And what will you do in the day of judgment and in destruction, of ruin when] it comes from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.4'>Surely they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. In all this His hand is not turned away, but His hand [is] stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.5'>Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger! And the staff in their hand is My fury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.6'>I will send him against an ungodly nation, and against the people of My wrath. I will command him to take the plunder, and to strip off the spoil, and to trample them like the mud of the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.7'>Yet he does not plan this, nor does his heart think so. For [it is] in his heart to destroy and cut off not a few nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.8'>For he says, [Are] not my commanders all like kings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.9'>[Is] not Calno like Carchemish? [Is] not Hamath like Arpad? [Is] not Samaria like Damascus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.10'>As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols, and their graven images [more than] Jerusalem's and Samaria's;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.11'>shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Samaria and her idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.12'>And it will be, when the Lord has broken off all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his high looks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.13'>For he says, By the strength of my hand I have done [it], and by my wisdom; for I am wise. And I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the people like a strong man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.14'>And my hand has found as a nest the riches of the people; and as one gathers eggs [that are] left, I have gathered all the earth; and there was none who moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.15'>Shall the axe boast itself against him who chops with it? Shall the saw magnify itself against him who moves it? As [if] the rod [could] wave those who lift [itself] up! As [if] a staff could raise [what is] not wood!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.16'>Therefore the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, shall send leanness among his fat ones; and under his glory [He] shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.17'>And the light of Israel shall be as a fire, and His holy One as a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.18'>And it shall burn up the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, both soul and body; and they shall be as when a sick one faints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.19'>And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a boy might write them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.20'>And it shall be in that day, the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob, shall never again lean on him who struck them; but truly lean on Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.21'>The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.22'>For though Your people Israel are like the sand of the sea, [yet] a remnant of them shall return; the full end which is decreed shall overflow [with] righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.23'>For the Lord Jehovah of hosts shall make a full end, as ordained, in the midst of all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.24'>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah of hosts, O my people who dwell [in] Zion, do not fear Assyria. He shall strike you with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against you, in the way of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.25'>But yet a little while, and the fury shall cease, and My anger [shall be] in their ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.26'>And Jehovah of hosts shall stir up a whip on him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and [as] His rod was on the sea, so shall He lift it up in the way of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.27'>And it shall be, in that day his burden shall be taken away from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.28'>He has come to Aiath, he has passed to Migron; at Michmash he has stored his baggage;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.10.31'>Madmenah wanders; the people of Gebim take refuge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.32'>Yet [he] shall remain in Nob today; [he] shall shake his hand [against] the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.33'>Behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror; and the lofty ones [shall be] cut down, and the proud shall be humbled.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.36'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.1'>And it happened in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.2'>And the king of Assyria sent the chief of the cupbearers from Lachish to Jerusalem, to king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the Fuller's Field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.3'>Then Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Asaph's son Joah, the recorder, came out to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.4'>And the chief of the cupbearers said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, So says the great king, the king of Assyria, What hope [is] this in which you trust?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.5'>I say, [Are] only words of the lips wisdom and strength for war? Now, in whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.6'>Lo, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; on which, [if] a man lean on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So [is] Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.7'>But if you say to me, We trust in Jehovah our God; [is it] not He whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.8'>Now then, please exchange pledges with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses if you are able on your part to set riders on them for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.9'>How then will you turn away the face of one commander of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.10'>Have I now come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.11'>And Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the chief of the cupbearers, Please speak to your servants [in] Aramaic, for we understand [it]. But do not speak to us [in] Jewish in the ears of the people on the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.12'>But the chief of the cupbearers said, Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall? that they may eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.13'>Then the chief of the cupbearers stood and cried with a loud voice [in] Jewish, and said, Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.14'>So says the king, Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.15'>Nor let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us; this city shall not be delivered into the hands of the king of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.16'>Do not listen to Hezekiah; for so says the king of Assyria, Make a blessing with me by a present, and come out to me; and let everyone eat of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and everyone drink the waters [of] his own cistern,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.17'>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.18'>[Let] not Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.19'>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where [are] the gods of Sepharvaim? And when have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.20'>Who among all the gods of these lands that have delivered their land out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.21'>But they were silent and did not answer him a word, for the king's command, saying, Do not answer him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.22'>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who [was] over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah [with their] clothes torn and told him the words of the chief of the cupbearers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.37'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.1'>And it happened when king Hezekiah heard, he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.2'>And he sent Eliakim, who [was] over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.3'>And they said to him, So says Hezekiah, This day [is] a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy! For the sons have come to the birth, and no strength to bring forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.4'>It may be Jehovah your God will hear the words of the chief of the cupbearers, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which Jehovah your God has heard. And you shall lift up [your] prayer for the remnant that is left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.5'>So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.6'>And Isaiah said to them, So you shall say to your master, So says the LORD, Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.7'>Behold, I will send a blast on him, and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.8'>So the chief of the cupbearers returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah. For he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.9'>And he heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He has come out to war with you. And he heard and sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.10'>So you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.11'>Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by completely destroying them. And shall you be delivered?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.12'>Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed: Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.13'>Where [is] the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.14'>And Hezekiah received the letter from the courier's hand, and read it. And Hezekiah went up [into] the house of the LORD and spread it before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.15'>And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.16'>O Jehovah of hosts, God of Israel, who dwells [between] the cherubs, You [are] He, God, You alone to all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.17'>Bow down Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib which he has sent to mock the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.18'>Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.19'>and have cast their gods into the fire, for they [were] no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; so they have destroyed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.20'>And now, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You [are] the LORD, You alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.21'>And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, So says Jehovah, God of Israel, Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.22'>this [is] the word which the LORD has spoken concerning him: The virgin, the daughter of Zion, has despised you [and] laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken [her] head behind you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.23'>Whom have you mocked and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised [your] voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Even against the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.24'>By your servants you have mocked Jehovah and have said, by my many chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars of it, [and] its choice fir trees; and I will go to its greatest height, the forest of its Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.25'>I have dug and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.26'>Have you not heard from afar? I made it from days of old, even I have formed it. Now I have caused it to come, and you are to cause fortified cities to crash [into] heaps, ruins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.27'>And their inhabitants [were] short of hand; dismayed and ashamed. They were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, [as] the grass on the housetops, even grain blasted before it has risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.28'>But I know your sitting down, and your going out, and your coming in, and your rage against Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.29'>Because of your raging against Me, and your arrogance has come up into My ears, therefore I will put My hook in your nose, and My bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way which you came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.30'>And this [shall be] a sign to you: You shall eat self-sown grain [this] year; and the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year you shall sow, and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.31'>The remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.32'>for out of Jerusalem shall go out a remnant, and those who escape out of Mount Zion; the zeal of Jehovah of hosts shall do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.33'>So the LORD says this to the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it [with] shield, nor cast a bank against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.34'>By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and shall not come into this city, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.35'>For I will defend this city to save it, for My own sake and for My servant David's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.36'>Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of Assyria. And they rose early in the morning, and behold! They [were] all dead corpses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.37'>And Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.38'>And it happened as he was worshiping [in] the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword. And they escaped [into] the land of Ararat; and Esar-haddon his son reigned in his place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.66.3'>He who kills an ox is [is as if] he killed a man; he who sacrifices a lamb [is as if] he broke a dog's neck; he who offers an offering [is as if] he offered swine's blood; he who burns incense [is as if] he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.4'>I also will choose the things that delude them, and I will bring their fears on them, because I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they did not hear. But they did evil before My eyes and chose [that] in which I did not delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.5'>Hear the Word of the LORD, you who tremble at His Word; your brothers who hated you, who cast you out for My name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified. But He will appear to your joy, and they will be ashamed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.66.17'>Those who sanctify themselves, and purify themselves [to go] into the gardens, behind one [tree] in the middle, eating swine's flesh, and the hateful thing, and the mouse, will be cut off together, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.18'>For I [know] their works and their thoughts; it comes to gather all the nations and the tongues; and they will come and see My glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.19'>And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those who escape from them to the nations, [to] Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, drawers of the bow; [to] Tubal, and Javan, [to] the far away coasts that have not heard My fame, nor have seen My glory.
