      <chapter osisID='Ezek.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>And it happened in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], in the fifth of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>On the fifth of the month, the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>Coming the Word of Jehovah became known] to Ezekiel, the son of Buzi, the priest in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar. And the hand of the LORD was on him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>And I looked, and behold, a windstorm came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire flashing itself, and a brightness to it all around, and out of its midst, like the color of polished bronze out of the middle of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>Also out of its midst [came] the likeness of four living creatures. And this [was] how they looked; they had the likeness of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>And four faces [were] to each, and four wings to each.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>And their feet [were] straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot. And they sparkled like the color of burnished copper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>And the [hands] of a man [extended] from under their wings on their four sides; and the four of them [had] their faces and their wings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>joining each one to the other [by] their wings. They did not turn in their going; each one went toward the front of their face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>And the likeness of their faces: the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right [side] to the four of them; and the face of an ox on the left side to the four of them; and the face of an eagle to the four of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>So their faces [were]. And their wings [were] stretched upward; to each, the two [wings] of each one were joined; and two [wings] covered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>And each went toward the front of their faces. To where the spirit was to go, there they went; they did not turn in their going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>And the likeness of the living creatures: they looked like burning coals of fire; like the appearance of torches. It was continually circling among the living creatures. And the fire [was] bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>And the living creatures kept running and returning, like the appearance of a flash of lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>And as I looked at the living creatures, behold, one wheel [was] on the earth by the living creatures, with its four faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship [was] the color of beryl, and the four of them had one likeness. And their appearance and their workmanship [was] like a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>When they went, they went on their four sides; [and] they did not turn when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>And their rims: they [were] even high; they were even awesome. And their rims [were] full of eyes all around the four of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>And in the going of the living creatures, the wheels went beside them; and in the lifting up of the living creatures from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>Wherever the spirit was to go, there they went; there the spirit [was] to go, and the wheels were lifted up along with them. For the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>In their going, [these] went; and in their standing still, these stood still. And in their lifting up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up along with them. For the spirit of the living creature [was] in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>And there [was] a likeness over the heads of the living creature; an expanse, like the color of awesome crystal stretched out over their heads from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>And under the expanse their wings [were] straight, the one toward the other. Each one had two [wings] covering on this [side], and to each two covering on that [side of] their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>And I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, in their going [was] the sound of tumult, like the sound of an army. In their standing still, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>And there was a voice from the expanse which [was] over their heads, in their standing still, and they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>And from above the expanse that [was] over their heads [was] a likeness like a sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne. And on the likeness of the throne [was] a likeness looking like a man on it from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>And I saw [Him] looking like the color of polished bronze, looking like fire all around within it. From the likeness of His loins even upward, and from the likeness of His loins even downward, I saw [Him], looking like fire, and it had brightness all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>As the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain looks, so the brightness all around looked. This was how the likeness of the glory of the LORD looked. And I saw. And I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of One speaking.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>And He said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>And the Spirit entered into me when He spoke to me, and set me on my feet, so that I heard Him who spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>And He said to me, Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to the nations, the rebelling ones who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have sinned against Me, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>And the sons [are] stiff of face, and hard of heart. I am sending you to them; and you shall say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>And they, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear; for they [are] a rebellious house. Yea, they shall know that there has been a prophet among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, and of their words, though briers and thorns [are] with you, and you dwell among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words, nor frightened by their faces, though they [are] a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>And you shall speak My words to them, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear, for they [are] rebellious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>But you, son of man, hear what I am saying to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>And I looked, and behold! A hand [was] extended to me; and lo, a roll of a book [was] in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>And He spread it before me; and it [was] written on the face and the back. And written on it [were] weepings, and mourning, and woe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>And He said to me, Son of man, eat what you find. Eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that roll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>And He said to me, Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your belly with this roll that I give you. Then I ate [it]; and in my mouth it was like honey for sweetness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>And He said to me, Son of man, go! Go up to the house of Israel and speak to them with My words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>For you [are] not sent to a people of a deep lip and of a difficult language, [but] to the house of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>not to many people of a deep lip and of a difficult language, whose words you cannot hear. Surely, if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>But the house of Israel will not listen to you, for they will not listen to Me; for all the house of Israel [are] strong of forehead and hard of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces and your forehead strong against their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>I have made your forehead as an adamant harder than flint. Do not be bowed down by their faces, though they [are] a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>And He said to me, Son of man, receive all My words which I shall speak to you in your heart, and hear with your ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>And go! Go to those of the captivity, to the sons of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, So says the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear or whether they will forbear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>And the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a sound of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed [be] the glory of the LORD from His place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>[I] also [heard] the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching one another, and the sound of the wheels along with them, and a sound of a great rushing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>Then I came to the exiles at Tel-at-abib, who lived by the river Chebar. And I sat [where] they sat; and I also dwelt seven days, being stricken dumb among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>And it happened at the end of seven days, even it happened [that] the Word of the LORD [came] to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word of My mouth, and give them warning from Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>When I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; and you do not give him warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked one shall die in his iniquity; but I will require his blood at your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>Yet if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>And when the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and when I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>But if you warn the righteous so that the righteous does not sin, and if he does not sin, he shall surely live because he is warned; also you have delivered your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>And the hand of the LORD was on me there. And He said to me, Arise, go out into the plain, and I will talk with you there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>Then I arose and went out into the plain; and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar. And I fell on my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>And the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet; and spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut yourself inside your house!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>But you, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands on you and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be dumb and shall not be one who warns them. For they [are] a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: He who hears, let him hear; and he who stops his ears, let him stop; for they [are] a rebellious house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.1'>And you, son of man, take a tile to yourself, and lay it before you, and portray on it the city Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.2'>And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mound against it. Also set the camp against it, and set [battering] rams against it all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.3'>And take an iron griddle to yourself, and set it [for] a wall of iron between you and the city. And set your face against it, and it shall be under attack. And you shall set a battle against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.4'>Also lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; [according] to the number of days that you shall lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.5'>For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days. So you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.6'>And when you have fulfilled them, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days; a day for a year; a day for a year, I have set for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.7'>And you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and your arm [shall be] uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.8'>And, behold, I will lay bands on you, and you shall not turn yourself from one side to [another] until you have ended the days of your siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.9'>Take also to yourself wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make bread of them for yourself. [According] to the number of the days that you shall lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.10'>And your food which you shall eat [shall be] by weight twenty shekels a day; from time to time you shall eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.11'>You shall also drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin. From time to time you shall drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.12'>And you shall eat it [as] barley cakes, and you shall bake it with dung of the excrement of man, in their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.13'>And the LORD said, Even so shall the sons of Israel eat their defiled bread among the nations, where I will drive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.14'>Then I said, Ah Lord Jehovah! Behold, my soul has not been defiled. For from my youth up, even till now, I have not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither did there come any unclean flesh into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.15'>Then He said to me, Lo, I have given you cow's dung for man's dung, and you shall prepare your bread with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.16'>And He said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. And they shall eat bread by weight, and with care. And they shall drink water by measure, and in silence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.17'>so that they may lack bread and water, and be stricken dumb with one another, and waste away in their iniquity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.1'>And you, son of man, take a sharp sword to yourself, take a barber's razor also, and cause [it] to pass on your head and on your beard. Then take scales to weigh, and divide the [hair].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.2'>You shall burn a third part with fire in the middle of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and you shall take a third part [and] beat around it with a sword; and you shall scatter a third part in the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.3'>Also you shall take a few of them in number, and tie them up in your skirts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.4'>Then take of them again, and throw them into the middle of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for a fire shall come forth from them into all the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.5'>So says the Lord Jehovah: This [is] Jerusalem. I have set it in the middle of the nations, and all around her [are] the lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.6'>And she has changed My judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and [defiled] My laws more than the countries that [are] all around her; for they have rejected My judgments and My laws; they have not walked in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.7'>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: Because you multiplied more than the nations that [are] all around you, [and] have not walked in My laws, neither have kept My judgments, nor have done according to the judgments of the nations all around you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.8'>therefore so says the Lord Jehovah; Behold, I, even I, [am] against you, and will carry out judgments in your midst before the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.9'>And I will do in you that which I have not done, and the like of which I will never do again, because of all your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.10'>So the fathers shall eat the sons in your midst, and the sons shall eat their fathers. And I will execute judgments in you, and I will scatter the whole remnant of you into all the winds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.11'>Therefore, [as] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, surely, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all your abominations, therefore I will also withdraw; nor shall My eye spare you, nor will I have any pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.12'>A third part of you shall die with the plague, and shall be consumed with the famine in your midst. And a third part shall fall by the sword all around you; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.13'>So My anger shall be fulfilled, and I will cause My fury to rest on them, and I will be comforted. And they shall know that I the LORD have spoken [it] in My zeal, when I have fulfilled My fury in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.14'>And I will make you a waste and a curse among the nations that [are] all around you, in the sight of all who pass by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.15'>So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an chastening and a horror to the nations which [are] all around you, when I shall execute judgments against you in anger and in fury and in rebukes [among them]. I the LORD have spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.16'>When I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for [their] ruin, which I will send to destroy you; even I will increase the famine on you, and break your staff of bread;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.17'>yea, I will send on you famine and evil beasts, and you will be bereaved. And pestilence and blood shall pass among you; and I shall bring a sword on you. I the LORD have spoken.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.1'>And it happened, the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.2'>Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.3'>And say, Mountains of Israel, hear the Word of the Lord. So says the Lord Jehovah to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers and to the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.4'>And your altars shall be wasted, and your pillars shall be broken. And I will make fall your slain before your idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.5'>And I will put the dead bodies of the sons of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones around your altars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.6'>In all the places where you live, cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be deserted; so that your altars may be laid waste and become guilty, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your pillars may be cut down, and your works wiped out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.7'>And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.8'>Yet I will leave a reminder that may be [left] to you [some] who escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered through the lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.9'>And those of you who escape shall remember Me among the nations where they shall be exiled, because I was broken [by] their whoring heart which has departed from Me, and with their whoring eyes which go after their idols. And they shall despise themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.10'>And they shall know that I [am] the LORD, [and that] I have not said in vain to do this evil to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.11'>So says the Lord Jehovah: Strike with your hand and stamp with your foot, and say, Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they shall fall by the sword, and by the famine, and by the plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.12'>He who is afar off shall die of the plague; and he who is near shall fall by the sword; and he who remains and is under siege shall die by the famine. So I will fulfill My fury on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.13'>Then you shall know that I [am] the LORD, when their dead shall be among their idols all around their altars, on every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every leafy oak, the place where they offered sweet aroma to all their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.14'>And I will stretch out My hand on them and make the land a waste, even more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all the places where they live; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.7'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.1'>And it happened, the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.2'>And you, son of man, so says the Lord Jehovah to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come on the four corners of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.3'>Now the end [is] on you, and I will send My anger on you and will judge you according to your ways, and will lay on you all your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.4'>And My eye shall not spare you, neither will I have pity. But I will repay your ways on you, and your abominations shall be in your midst; and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.5'>So says the Lord Jehovah: An evil: Behold, an only evil has come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.6'>An end has come, the end has come. It awakes against you; behold, it has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.7'>The encirclement has come to you, O dwellers of the land. The time has come, the day of tumult [is] near, and not a shout of the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.8'>And I will soon pour out My fury on you, and fulfill My anger on you. And I will judge you according to your ways, and will repay you for all your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.9'>And My eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; I will repay you according to your ways and your abominations [that] are in your midst. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD who strikes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.10'>Behold the day! Behold, it has come; the encirclement has gone out; the rod has blossomed; pride has budded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.11'>Violence has risen up for a rod of wickedness. None of them [shall remain], nor of their multitude, nor of any of their riches; nor [shall] there [be] wailing for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.12'>The time has come; the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath [is] on all her multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.13'>For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they are still alive; for the vision to all her multitude shall not return, and a man shall not hold his life strong in iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.14'>They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goes to the battle, for My wrath [is] on all her multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.15'>The sword [is] outside, and the plague and the famine inside. He who [is] in the field shall die with the sword; and he in the city shall be devoured by famine and plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.16'>But [if] their fugitives shall escape, then they shall be like doves of the valleys on the mountains, all of them mourning, each one for his iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.17'>All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall go [weak as] water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.18'>They shall also gird [on] sackcloth, and trembling shall cover them; and shame [shall be] on all faces, and baldness on all heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.19'>They shall throw their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be an impure thing. Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because their iniquity has become a stumbling-block for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.20'>And the beauty of His ornament, He set it in majesty. But they made the images of their abominations [and] of their hateful things in it; therefore I have put it to them as an impure thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.21'>And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prize, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall defile it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.22'>I will also turn My face from them, and they shall defile My secret [place]; and violent ones shall enter into it and defile it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.23'>Make a chain; for the land is full of bloody judgments, and the city is full of violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.24'>And I will bring the most evil of the nations, and they shall possess their houses. I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.25'>Ruin comes; and they shall seek peace, but none [shall be].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.26'>Disaster on disaster shall come, and rumor to rumor shall be. And they shall seek a vision from the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and wisdom from the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.27'>The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled. I will do to them according to their way, and according to their judgments I will judge them; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.8'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.1'>And it was in the sixth year, in the sixth [month], on the fifth of the month, I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me. And the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell on me there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.2'>And I looked, and behold! A likeness as the look of fire; from the appearance of His loins and downward, [like] fire. And from His loins and upward as the look of brightness, like the color of polished bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.3'>And He put out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head. And the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heavens, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the opening of the inner gate facing north, where there [was] a seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.4'>And, behold! The glory of the God of Israel [was] there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.5'>And He said to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now to the way of the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and behold, northward at the gate of the altar the image of jealousy [was] at the entrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.6'>And He said to me, Son of man, do you see what they do; even the great abominations which the house of Israel is doing here, that I should go far off from My sanctuary? But turn again, [and] you shall see greater abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.7'>And He brought me to the opening of the court; and I looked, and behold, a hole in the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.8'>And He said to me, Son of man, dig in the wall now. And I dug in the wall, and, behold, an opening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.9'>And he said to me. Go in and see the evil abominations that they do here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.10'>And I went in and saw. And behold, every kind of creeping thing, and hateful beast, and all the idols of the house of Israel, were carved on the wall all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.11'>And seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, standing among them, these were before them, and each man with his censor in his hand. And the odor of the cloud of incense was rising.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.12'>And He said to me, Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, each man in his image room? For they are saying, The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.13'>He also said to me, You turn again, [and] you shall see greater evils that they are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.14'>And He brought me to the opening of the gate of the LORD's house, toward the north. And behold, women were sitting there, weeping for Tammuz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.15'>And He said to me, Have you seen, O son of man? Turn yet again, [and] you shall see greater evils than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.16'>And He brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and behold, at the opening of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, [were] about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east; and they bowed themselves eastward to the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.17'>And He said to me, Have you seen, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they do the hateful things which they do here? For they have filled the land with violence and have turned to provoke Me to anger. And lo, they put the branch to their nose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.18'>And I will also deal with fury; My eye shall not spare, nor will I have pity. And though they cry in My ears [with] a loud voice, I will not hear them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.9'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.1'>And He cried in my ears [with] a loud voice, saying, Let the overseers of the city draw near, even each [with] his destroying weapon in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.2'>And behold, six men came from the way of the Upper Gate which faces north, and each had his shattering weapon in his hand. And one man among them [was] clothed with linen, and a writer's inkhorn by his side. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.3'>And the glory of the God of Israel had gone on from the cherub, where it was on it, to the threshold of the house. And He called to the man clothed in linen, [with] the writer's inkhorn by his side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.4'>And the LORD said to him, Go through in the midst of the city, in the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men who are groaning and are mourning because of all the abominations that are done in her midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.5'>And He said to those in my hearing, Go over in the city after him, and strike. Let not your eye spare, nor have pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.6'>Fully destroy old [men], young men and virgins, and little children and women. But do not come near any man on whom [is] the mark. And begin at My sanctuary. And they began at the old men who [were] before the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.7'>And He said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out! And they went out and killed in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.8'>And it happened as they were slaying them, and I remained, then I fell on my face and cried, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! Will You destroy all the remnant of Israel in Your pouring out of Your fury on Jerusalem?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.9'>And He said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah [is] great, and the land is full of blood, and the city is full of perversity. For they say, The LORD has forsaken the land; and, the LORD does not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.10'>And even I, My eye shall not spare, nor will I have pity, [but] I will put their way on their head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.11'>And behold, the man clothed with linen, [with] the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as You have commanded me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.10'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.1'>And I looked, and behold! In the expanse over the head of the cherubs appeared the look of the form of a throne, like a sapphire stone, above them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.2'>And He spoke to the man clothed [with] linen, and said, Go in among the wheels, under the cherub, and fill your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubs, and scatter [them] on the city. And he went in before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.3'>And the cherubs were standing on the right side of the house when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.4'>And the glory of the LORD rose from the cherub, over the threshold of the house. And the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD's glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.5'>And the sound of the cherubs' wings was heard over the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when He speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.6'>And it happened when He had commanded the man clothed [with] linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubs; he went in then and stood beside the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.7'>And a cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubs to the fire between the cherubs, and he lifted it and put [it] into the hands of the one clothed with linen. And he took [it] and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.8'>And the form of a man's hand was seen under the wings of the cherubs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.9'>And I looked, and behold, the four wheels [were] beside the cherubs, one wheel was by one cherub, and another wheel by one cherub; and the wheels looked like the color of a stone of Tarshish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.10'>And their appearance was as one, the four of them, as if the wheel were in the midst of the wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.11'>When they went, they went on their four sides. They did not turn as they went, for to the place where the head faces, after it they went. They did not turn as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.12'>And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels [were] full of eyes all around, [even] their wheels that the four of them had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.13'>As for the wheels, it was cried to them in my hearing, Whirling wheel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.14'>And four faces were to each one. The first face [was] the face of a cherub, and the second face [was] the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.15'>And the cherubs rose up. This [is] the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.16'>And when the cherubs went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubs lifted their wings to soar from the earth, the wheels did not turn from beside them, even they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.17'>When they stood still, [these] stood still, and when they rose up, [these] lifted up. For the spirit of the living creature [was] in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.18'>And the glory of the LORD went from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.19'>And the cherubs lifted up their wings and rose up from the earth in my sight. When they went out, the wheels also [were] beside them. And he stood at the door of the eastern gate of the LORD's house. And the glory of the God of Israel [was] over them from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.20'>This [is] the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar, and I knew that they [were] cherubs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.21'>Four, [even] four faces [are] to each; and four wings to each. And the form of a man's hands [was] under their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.22'>And the form of their faces, they [are] the faces that I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances even theirs. They each went straight forward.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.11'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.1'>And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the eastern gate of the LORD's house, which faces eastward. And behold, twenty-five men were at the opening of the gate; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, rulers of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.2'>And He said to me, Son of man, these [are] the men who plot evil and give wicked advice in this city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.3'>who say, [It is] not near; let us build houses; this [city is] the pot, and we [are] the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.4'>Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, O son of man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.5'>And the Spirit of the LORD fell on me, and said to me, Speak: So says the LORD: So you have said, O house of Israel, for I Myself know the elevations of your spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.6'>You have multiplied your dead in this city, and you have filled its streets with the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.7'>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom you have laid in her midst, they [are] the flesh, and this [city is] the pot. But I will bring you out of her midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.8'>You have feared the sword, and I will bring a sword on you, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.9'>And I will bring you out of her midst, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.10'>You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel, and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.11'>This [city] shall not be your pot, nor shall you be the flesh in her midst. But I will judge you in the border of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.12'>and you shall know that I [am] the LORD. For you have not walked in My statutes, nor have you done My judgments, but have done after the customs of the nations all around you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.13'>And it happened when I prophesied, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. And I fell on my face and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! Will You make a full end [of] the remnant of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.14'>Again the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.15'>Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your redemption, and all the house of Israel, of all that have heard the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying to all of them, Go far away from Jehovah; this land is given to us for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.16'>Therefore say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Though I have sent them far off among the nations, and though I scattered them among the lands, yet I will be to them as a little sanctuary in the lands where they had gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.17'>Therefore say, So says the Lord Jehovah: I will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the lands, in those where you were scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.18'>And they shall come there, and they shall take away all its hateful things and all its abominations from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.19'>And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. And I will remove the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.21'>And [as] to [those whose] heart is going [after] their hateful things, and [also] their heart [is after] their disgusting idols, I will give their way on their own heads, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.22'>And the cherubs lifted up their wings, and the wheels beside them. And the glory of the God of Israel [was] over them above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.23'>And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain which [is] on the east side of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.24'>And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the exiles. And the vision that I had seen went up from me.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.12'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.1'>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.2'>Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see and see not. They have ears to hear and hear not, for they [are] a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.3'>Therefore, son of man, prepare for yourself vessels for exile, and go into exile by day before their eyes. And you shall be exiled from your place to another place before their eyes. It may be they will consider, though they [are] a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.4'>And you shall bring out your vessels, as vessels for exile, by day before their eyes. And you shall go out at evening before their eyes, as those going into exile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.5'>Dig through the wall before their eyes, and carry out through it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.6'>Before their eyes you shall carry [it] on [your] shoulders, carry it out in the dark. You shall cover your face so that you do not see the ground, for I have set you as a sign to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.7'>And I did as I was commanded. By day I brought out my vessel as a vessel for exile. And in the evening I dug by hand through the wall. I brought [it] out in the dark, and I carried it on [my] shoulder before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.8'>And in the morning the Word of the LORD [came] to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.9'>Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, What are you doing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.10'>Say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: This burden [concerns] the king in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.11'>Say, I [am] your sign: As I have done, so it shall be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.12'>And the king who [is] among them shall carry [burdens] on [his] shoulder in the dark, and shall go out. They shall dig through the wall to carry out by it. He shall hide his face so that he does not see the ground with  his] eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.13'>I will also spread My net on him, and He shall be taken in My snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans. Yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.14'>And I will scatter to every wind all who [are] around him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.15'>And they shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations and scatter them in the countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.16'>But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the plague, so that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they come. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.17'>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.18'>Son of man, eat your bread with quaking and drink your water with trembling and anxiety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.19'>And say to the people of the land: So says the Lord Jehovah of the people of Jerusalem [and] of the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with horror, so that her land may be desolated of her fullness, because of the violence of all those who dwell in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.20'>And the cities that have people shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.21'>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.22'>Son of man, what [is] this proverb [that] you have in the land of Israel, saying, The days will go on and every vision shall fail?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.23'>Therefore tell them, So says the Lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel. But say to them, The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.24'>For there shall never again be any vain vision nor slippery divination within the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.25'>For I, the LORD, will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be done. It shall no more be delayed; for in your days, O rebellious house, I will say the word and will do it, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.26'>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.27'>Son of man, behold, the house of Israel says, The vision that he sees [is] for many days to come, and he prophesies of the times that are far off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.28'>Therefore say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: There shall none of my words be delayed any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.1'>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.2'>Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy. And say to those who prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear the Word of Jehovah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.3'>So says the Lord Jehovah, Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.4'>O Israel, your prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.5'>You have not gone up into the breaks, nor built the wall for the house of Israel, that it might stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.6'>They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD says. And the LORD has not sent them; but they hoped to confirm [their] word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.7'>Did you not see a vain vision, and speak a lying divination? Yet you say, The LORD says; although I have not spoken?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.8'>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have spoken vanity and seen a lie, therefore, behold, I [am] against you, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.9'>And My hand shall be against the prophets who see vanity and who divine a lie. They shall not be in the council of My people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.10'>Because, even because they made My people go astray, saying, Peace; and [there was] no peace; and he builds a wall, and lo, [others] daubed it with lime.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.11'>Say to those who daub [with] lime, yes, it shall fall; [there] will be a flooding rain; and you, O hailstones, shall fall, and a stormy wind will break.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.12'>And, behold, when the wall has fallen, shall it not be said to you, Where [is] the daubing with which you have daubed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.13'>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: I will even break [it with] a stormy wind in My fury. And there shall be an flooding rain in My anger, and hailstones in fury to destroy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.14'>And I will break down the wall that you have daubed [with] lime, and touch it to the ground; yea, I will bare its base. And it shall fall, and you shall be destroyed in her midst; and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.15'>And I will fulfill My wrath on the wall and on those who daubed it [with] lime. And I will say to you, The wall [is] no more; and, Those who daubed [are] no more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.16'>the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and [there is] no peace, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.17'>And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart. And prophesy against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.18'>and say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to those sewing bands to all joints of my hands, and make long veils for the head of every [man] of stature, to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of My people, and will you save alive the souls for yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.19'>And will you profane Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls that should not die; and to save alive the souls that should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.20'>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I [am] against your bands with which you are hunting the souls there, to make them fly. And I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, the souls which you are hunting, to make them fly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.21'>Also I will tear your long veils and deliver My people out of your hand, and they shall no more be in your hand to be hunted. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.22'>Because with lies you have saddened the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and have made the hands of the wicked strong, so that he should not turn from his wicked way, by promising him life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.23'>therefore you shall not see vanity, and you shall not divine any divination. and I will deliver My people out of your hands; and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.14'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.1'>And some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.2'>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.3'>Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts, and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face. Should I at all be inquired of by them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.4'>Therefore speak to them, and say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him in it by the host of his idols;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.5'>so that I may capture the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are estranged from Me by their idols, all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.6'>Therefore say to the house of Israel, So says the Lord Jehovah: Repent and turn from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.7'>For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger who lives in Israel, who separates himself from Me and sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to a prophet to ask of him concerning Me; I the LORD will answer him Myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.8'>And I will set My face against that man, and I will make him desolate for a sign and for proverbs. And I will cut him off from the midst of My people; and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.9'>And the prophet, if he is deceived, and he speaks a word, I the LORD have deceived that prophet. And I will stretch out My hand on him and will destroy him in the midst of My people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.10'>And they shall bear their iniquity. As the iniquity of the inquirer, so the iniquity of the prophet shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.11'>So that the house of Israel may never again go astray from Me, nor be defiled again with all their transgressions, but they are to Me My people, and I will be to them for God, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.12'>The Word of the LORD came again to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.13'>Son of man, when a land sins against Me by traitorous betraying, then I will stretch out My hand on it, and will break the staff of its bread, and will send famine on it, and will cut off man and beast from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.14'>And [though] these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver [only] their own souls by their righteousness, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.15'>If I cause destroying beasts to come through the land, and they spoil it so that it is deserted, so that no one may pass through because of the beasts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.16'>[though] these three men were in its midst, [as] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters. They only shall be delivered, but the land shall be deserted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.17'>Or [if] I bring a sword on that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.18'>though these three men [were] in it, [as] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they [only] shall be delivered themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.19'>Or [if] I send a plague into that land, and pour out My fury on it in blood, to cut off man and beast from it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.20'>though Noah, Daniel, and Job [were] in it, [as] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter. They shall [only] deliver their own souls by their righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.21'>For so says the Lord Jehovah: How much more when I send My four evil judgments on Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the destroying beast, and the plague, to cut off man and beast from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.22'>Yet, behold, there shall be left a remnant in it that shall be brought out, sons and daughters. Behold, they shall come out to you, and you shall see their way and their doings. And you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I brought on Jerusalem, [for] all that I have brought on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.23'>And they shall comfort you when you see their way and their doings. And you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.15'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.1'>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.2'>Son of man, how is the vine tree more than any other tree, [or than] a branch which is among the trees of the forest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.3'>Shall wood be taken from it to do work? Or will [men] take from it [for] a peg to hang any vessel on it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.4'>Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel. The fire devours both its ends, and its middle is charred. Is it fit for [any] work?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.5'>Behold, when it was whole, it was not made for work. How much less when the fire has devoured it, and it is charred? Shall it yet be made to work?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.6'>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah, As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give the people of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.7'>And I will set My face against them; they shall go out from the fire, and the fire shall devour them. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD when I set My face against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.8'>And I will make the land [to be] desolate, because they have committed a treacherous act, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.16'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.1'>Again the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.2'>Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.3'>And say, So says the Lord Jehovah to Jerusalem, Your origin and your birth [is] of the land of Canaan. Your father was an Amorite, and your mother a Hittite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.4'>And [as for] your birth, in the day you were born your navel was not cut, nor were you washed with water to cleanse [you]. And you were not salted, nor swaddled at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.5'>No eye pitied you, to do any of these to you, to have compassion on you. But you were thrown out into the open field, because your life was despised in the day that you were born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.6'>And when I passed by you and saw you squirming in your blood, I said to you in your blood, Live! Yes, I said to you in your blood, Live!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.7'>I have caused you to multiply like the bud of the field, and you are grown, and you are great; and you come [in] the finest ornaments. [Your] breasts are formed, and hair is grown, yet you [were] naked and bare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.8'>And I passed by you and looked on you, and, behold, your time [was] the time of love. And I spread my skirt over you and covered your nakedness. And I swore to you and entered into a covenant with you, says the Lord Jehovah. And you became Mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.9'>And I washed you with water; I washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.10'>I also clothed you [with] embroidered work, and I shod you [with] dugong [sandals]. And I wrapped you in fine linen, and I covered you [with] silk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.11'>And I adorned you [with] ornaments, and I put bracelets on your hands and a chain on your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.12'>And I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.13'>And you were adorned with gold and silver; and your clothing [was of] fine linen and silk and embroidered work. You ate fine flour and honey and oil; and you were exceedingly beautiful. And you advanced to regal estate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.14'>And your name went out among the nations, because of your beauty; for it [was] perfect in My beauty, which I had put on you, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.15'>But you trusted in your beauty, and played the harlot because of your name, and poured out your fornications on all who passed by; it was his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.16'>And you took from your clothes and adorned your high places with different colors, and fornicated on them, [such as] had not come, nor shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.17'>And you have taken beautiful things of My gold and of My silver, which I had given you, and made images of males, and fornicated with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.18'>And [you] took your embroidered dresses and covered them, and you have given to their face My oil and My incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.19'>Also My food which I gave you, fine flour and oil and honey [with which] I fed you, you have given it to their face for a soothing aroma. And it happened, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.20'>And you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to Me, and you gave these to them for food. [Are] your fornications small?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.21'>You have slaughtered My sons and gave them to cause these to pass through [the fire] for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.22'>And in all your hateful deeds and your fornications you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, [and] squirming in your blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.23'>Woe, woe to you says the Lord Jehovah! [For] it happened after all your evil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.24'>[that] you have also built yourself a mound, and you have made yourself a high place in every street.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.25'>You have built your high place at the head of every way, and have made your beauty to be despised, and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by, and have multiplied your fornications.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.26'>You have also whored with the Egyptians, your neighbors great of flesh, and have multiplied your fornications to provoke Me to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.27'>And, behold, therefore I have stretched out My hand over you, and drew back your portion. And I gave you to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your wicked way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.28'>You have whored with the Assyrians, without your being satisfied; yea, you whored and yet you were not satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.29'>And your whoredom is idolatry in the land of Canaan, [to the] Chaldean, and yet you were not satisfied with this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.30'>How weak is your heart, says the Lord Jehovah, since you do all these, the work of a woman, an overbearing harlot;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.31'>in that you build your mound at the head of every way, and make your high place in every street. Yet you have not been as a harlot, scorning wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.32'>[Like] the adulterous wife, instead of her husband, she takes strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.33'>They give a gift to all harlots, but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them to come to you from all around, for your fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.34'>And in you was the opposite from [those] women in your fornications, since no one whores after you, and in your giving wages, and hire is not given to you. [In] this you are opposite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.35'>Therefore, O harlot, hear the Word of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.36'>So says the Lord Jehovah: Because your lewdness was poured out and your nakedness was bared in your fornications with your lovers, and with all the idols of your abominations, and by the blood of your sons whom you gave to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.37'>behold, therefore I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have been pleased, even all [whom] you loved, with all whom you have hated; I will even gather them against you from all around, and will uncover your nakedness to them, and they will see all your nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.38'>And I will judge you with judgments of adulteresses, and with shedders of blood. And I will give you blood and fury and jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.39'>And I will also give you into their hand, and they will tear down your mound, and will demolish your high places. They shall also strip you of your clothes, and shall take your beautiful things, and leave you naked and bare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.40'>They shall also raise a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones, and cut you with their swords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.41'>And they shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women. And I will make you stop whoring; and also, you shall not give hire again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.42'>And I will make My fury to rest against you, and My jealousy shall depart from you, and I will be quiet and will be angry no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.43'>Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have troubled Me in all these [things]; so, behold, I will also repay your way on [your] head, says the Lord Jehovah. And you shall not commit this wickedness above all your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.44'>Behold, all who use proverbs shall use [this] proverb against you, saying, As the mother, [so is] her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.45'>You [are] your mother's daughter, who despises her husband and her sons. And you [are] the sister of your sisters, who despise their husbands and their sons. Your mother [was] a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.46'>And your older sister [is] Samaria, she and her daughters who dwell at your left hand. And your younger sister, who dwells at your right hand, [is] Sodom and her daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.47'>Yet you have not walked according to their ways, nor done according to their hateful deeds; but, as [if it were] a very little [thing], you were corrupted more than they were in all your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.48'>[As] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, Sodom your sister, she nor her daughters, has not done as you have done, you and your daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.49'>Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom; pride. Fullness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters. Nor did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.50'>And they were haughty and did abominable things before Me, so I turned away as I saw [fit].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.51'>Nor has Samaria sinned [as much] as half your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters in all your abominations which you have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.52'>You also, who have judged your sisters, bear your own shame for your sins which you have committed more abominable than they. They are more righteous than you! Yes, blush and bear your shame, since you have justified your sisters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.53'>When I shall return their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then [also] the captivity of your captivity in their midst;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.54'>that you may bear your shame, and blush in all that you have done, since you are a comfort to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.55'>When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, then you and your daughters shall return to your former state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.56'>For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.57'>before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of [your] reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all her neighbors, the daughters of the Philistines who hated you from all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.58'>You are bearing your wickedness and your abominations, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.59'>For so says the Lord Jehovah: I will even deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.60'>But I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.61'>And you shall remember your ways and be ashamed, when you shall receive your sisters, your older and your younger. And I will give them to you for daughters, but not by [your] covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.62'>And I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall know that I [am] the LORD;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.63'>so that you may remember and be ashamed; and it will not be [possible] to open [your] mouth any more because of your shame; in that I am propitiated for all that you have done, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.17'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.1'>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.2'>Son of man, put out a riddle and speak a parable to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.3'>And say, So says the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle with great wings, long of pinion, full of feathers, who had different colors, came to Lebanon and took the highest branch of the cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.4'>He plucked off the top of its young twigs and carried it into a land of traders. He set it in a city of merchants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.5'>He also took of the seed of the land and planted it in a fruitful field. He placed [it] by great waters and set [it] as a willow tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.6'>And it grew and became a spreading low vine, whose branches turned toward him. And its roots were under him. So it became a vine and brought out branches and shot out boughs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.7'>There was also another great eagle [with] great wings and many feathers. And behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and shot out its branches toward him, that he might water it, away from the beds of its planting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.8'>It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring out branches, and that it might bear fruit, to be a splendid vine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.9'>Say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? Shall he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, and wither it? All the leaves of its sprouting shall wither, and not with great arm, nor by many people [shall any] raise it by its roots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.10'>And behold, [being] planted, shall it prosper? Shall it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It shall wither in the beds [where] it sprouted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.11'>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.12'>Say now to the rebellious house: Do you not know what these [things mean]? Tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon has come to Jerusalem and has taken its king and its rulers, and brings them to himself to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.13'>And he has taken of the king's seed and has made a covenant with him, and has taken an oath from him. He has also taken the mighty of the land,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.6'>and has not eaten on the mountains, nor has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, nor has defiled his neighbor's wife, nor has come near a menstruating woman,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.7'>and has not ill-treated any man, [but] has given the debtor's pledge back to him, has robbed none by violence, has given his bread to the hungry and has covered the naked with a garment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.8'>he has not given out on usury, nor has taken any increase, he has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has done judgment between man and man,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.19'>Yet you say, Why? Does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done justice and right, has kept all My statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.20'>The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor shall the father bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.21'>But if the wicked will turn from all his sins which he has committed, and keep all My statutes, and do justice and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.27'>Again, when the wicked turns away from his wickedness that he has committed and does that which is lawful and righteous, he shall save his soul alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.28'>Because he looks carefully, and turns away from all his sins that he has committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.29'>Yet says the house of Israel: The way of the LORD is not fair. O house of Israel, are not My ways fair? Are not your ways unfair?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.30'>So I will judge you, O house of Israel, each one of you according to his ways, says the Lord Jehovah. Turn and be made to turn from all your sins; and iniquity shall not be your stumbling-block.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.31'>Cast away from you all your sins by which you have sinned; and make you a new heart and a new spirit; for why will you die, O house of Israel?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.23'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.1'>The Word of the LORD came again to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.2'>Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.3'>And they fornicated in Egypt; they whored in their youth, their breasts were handled, and there their virgin nipples were worked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.4'>And their names [were] Oholah, the oldest, and Oholibah, her sister. And they were Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And their names: Samaria [is] Oholah, and Jerusalem [is] Oholibah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.5'>And Oholah whored under Me. And she lusted after her lovers, to [her] Assyrian neighbors,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.6'>clothed with purple, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.7'>So she bestowed her harlotries on them, the choice sons of Assyria; [with] all of them, and with all whom she lusted after; she defiled herself with all their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.8'>Nor did she leave her fornications from Egypt. For in her youth they lay with her, and they worked her virgin nipples, and poured their fornications on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.9'>Therefore I have given her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians on whom she lusted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.10'>They uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters and killed her with the sword. And she became notorious among women, and they executed judgment on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.11'>And her sister Oholibah saw, she was more corrupt in her lustfulness than she, and her fornications were greater than her sister's whoredom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.12'>She lusted to the sons of Assyria, governors and rulers nearby, clothed most perfectly; horsemen riding horses, all of them desirable young men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.13'>And I saw that she was defiled, one way [was] to both of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.14'>And she added to her fornications. And she saw men carved on the wall; images of the Chaldeans engraved with vermilion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.15'>girded with girdles on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like rulers, like the sons of Babylon [in] Chaldea, the land of their birth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.16'>and she lusted after them, to the look of her eyes, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.17'>And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with fornications. And she was defiled with them, and her mind was alienated from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.18'>So she uncovered her fornications and uncovered her nakedness. And My soul was alienated from her just as My soul was alienated from her sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.19'>Yet she multiplied her fornications to recall the days of her youth, in which she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.20'>And she lusted on her lovers, whose flesh is like the flesh of asses and whose issue [is like] the issue of horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.21'>So you longed for the wickedness of your youth, when the Egyptians worked your nipples, for the sake of the breasts of your youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.22'>So, O Oholibah, the Lord Jehovah says this: Behold, I will raise up against you your lovers, from whom your soul is alienated; and I will bring them against you from all around;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.23'>the Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, [and] all the Assyrians with them; all of them desirable young men, governors and rulers, all of them, third heads and called ones; all of them riding on horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.24'>And they shall come against you [with] weapons, chariots, and wheels, and with an assembly of peoples; buckler and shield and helmet shall set against you all around. And I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge you by their judgments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.25'>And I will set My jealousy against you, and they shall deal with you in fury. They shall take away your nose and your ears, and the rest of you shall fall by the sword. They shall take away your sons and your daughters, and the rest of you shall be devoured by the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.26'>They shall also strip you [of] your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.27'>So I will make your wickedness to cease from you, and your fornication from the land of Egypt. And you shall not lift up your eyes to them, nor shall you remember Egypt any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.28'>For so says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give you into the hand of [those] whom you hate, into the hand of whom your soul was alienated, from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.29'>And they shall deal with you in hatred, and shall take away all your labor, and shall leave you naked and bare. And the nakedness of your fornications shall be uncovered, both your wickedness and your fornications.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.30'>These [things] will be done to you because you have whored after the nations, and because you are defiled with their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.31'>You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.32'>So says the Lord Jehovah: You shall drink of your sister's cup deep and large; you shall be laughed to scorn and mocked; for it holds much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.33'>[In] drunkenness and sorrow you are filled, the cup of horror and ruin, the cup of your sister Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.34'>You shall even drink it and empty it. And you shall break its pieces, and tear off your own breasts. For I have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.35'>So the Lord Jehovah says this: Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, therefore bear also your wickedness and your adulteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.36'>And the LORD said to me: Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah, and declare to them their abominations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.37'>that they have committed adultery, and blood [is] on their hands? And they have committed adultery with their idols and have also caused their sons whom they bore to Me to pass through the fire to them, to devour them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.38'>And yet they have done this to Me: They have defiled My sanctuary in that day, and have profaned My sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.39'>And when they had slain their sons to their idols, then they came into My sanctuary in that day to profane it. And lo, this they have done in the midst of My house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.40'>And they have even sent for men to come from far, to whom a messenger [was] sent. And lo, they came. You washed yourself for them, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.41'>and sat on a stately bed with a table prepared before it, on which you set My incense and My oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.42'>And the sound of a crowd [was] at ease with her; and drunkards from the wilderness were brought with the men of the host of mankind; and they put bracelets on their hands, and crowns of beauty on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.43'>And I said about the one worn [in] adulteries, Will they now whore with her, and she [with them] ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.44'>And they went in to her, as [they] go in to a woman of harlotry; so they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the wicked women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.45'>And [as] righteous men, they shall judge them [with] the judgment of adulteresses, and the judgment of women who shed blood; because they [are] adulteresses, and blood [is] in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.46'>For so says the Lord Jehovah: I will bring up a company on them, and will give them to be removed and stripped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.47'>And the company shall stone them [with] stones, and cut them down with their swords. They shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.48'>So I will cause wickedness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught, even not to go after your wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.49'>And they shall put your wickedness on you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols. And you shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.24'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.1'>Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth of the month, the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.2'>Son of man, write for yourself the name of the day, even of this same day. The king of Babylon has leaned toward Jerusalem this same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.3'>And speak a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: Set on a pot; set [it] on, and also pour water into it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.6'>So the Lord Jehovah says this: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum [is] in it, and whose scum has not gone out of it! Bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.7'>For her blood is in her midst; she set it on the top of a rock. She did not pour it on the ground, to cover it [with] dust,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.9'>So the Lord Jehovah says this: Woe to the bloody city! I will even heap on the pile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.10'>And heap on the wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and mix in the spice, and let the bones be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.11'>And set it empty on its coals, so that its bronze may be hot and may glow, and [that] its uncleanness may be melted in it, [that] the scum of it may be burned away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.4'>The waters made him great; the deep set him up on high with her rivers running all around his plants, and sent out her little channels to all the trees of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.5'>So his height was lifted up above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the many waters, when he sent out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.6'>All the birds of the heavens nested in his boughs, and under his branches all the beasts of the field bore their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.7'>So he was beautiful in his greatness, in the length of his branches. For his root was by great waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.8'>The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him; the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches. Nor was any tree in the garden of God like him in his beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.9'>I have made him beautiful by his many branches, so that all the trees of Eden in the garden of God envied him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.10'>So the Lord Jehovah says this: Because you have lifted yourself up in height, and he set his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.11'>so I have given him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations. He shall surely deal with him; I have expelled him for his evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.12'>And strangers have cut him off, the fearful of the nations, and have left him. On the mountains and in all the valleys his branches have fallen, and his boughs have been broken by all the rivers of the land. And all the people of the earth have gone from his shadow, and have left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.13'>On his ruin shall all the birds of the heavens remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be on his branches,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.14'>to the end that none of all the trees [by] the waters shall be exalted in their height, nor give their top among the thick boughs, nor should their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water. For all of them are given to death, to the lower parts of the earth, in the midst of the sons of men, with those who go down into the Pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.15'>So says the Lord Jehovah: In the day when he went down to the grave, I caused a mourning. I covered the deep for him, and I held back its floods, and the great waters were held back. And I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.16'>I made the nations shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with those who go down in the Pit. And all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the lower parts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.17'>They also went down into hell with him to [those who are] slain with the sword, even his arm, who lived under his shadow in the midst of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.18'>To whom are you like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet you shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lower parts of the earth. You shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with [those] slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all [his] multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.1'>Also, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, Mountains of Israel, hear the Word of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.2'>So says the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy has said against you, Aha! Even the old high places have become a possession to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.3'>Therefore prophesy and say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Because of the wasting and crushing of you from all around, that you might be a possession to the rest of the nations, and you were lifted up on the tip of the tongue, and the talking of the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.4'>so, mountains of Israel, hear the Word of the Lord Jehovah. So says the Lord Jehovah to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the deserted wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and a mockery to the rest of the nations all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.5'>So the Lord Jehovah says this: Surely in the fire of My jealousy I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Idumea, who have given My land to themselves for a possession with all joy of heart, with scorning of soul, to make it open land for a prey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.6'>So prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the rivers and to the valleys, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and in My fury, because you have borne the shame of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.7'>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: I have lifted up My hand; surely the nations around you shall bear their shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.8'>But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall put out your branches and yield your fruit to My people Israel; for they have drawn near to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.9'>For, behold, I [am] for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.10'>And I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel, all of it. And the cities shall have people, and the wastes shall be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.11'>And I will multiply men and beast on you, and they shall increase and be fruitful. And I will make you dwell as before, and I will do better [to you] than at your beginnings. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.12'>Yea, I will cause men to walk on you, even My people Israel. And they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance, and not any more will increase their bereavement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.13'>So says the Lord Jehovah: Because they say to you, You [are] a devourer of men, and you have bereaved your nations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.14'>so you shall devour men no more, nor shall you bereave your nations any more, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.15'>Nor will I allow you to hear the shame of the nations any more, nor shall you bear the shame of the peoples any more, nor shall you cause your nations to fall any more, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.16'>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.17'>Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings, even as the defilement of woman's impurity, their way was before Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.18'>So I poured My fury on them, because of the blood that they had shed on the land, and for their idols [by which] they defiled it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.19'>And I scattered them among the nations, and they were scattered through the lands. I judged them according to their way and according to their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.20'>And when they entered the nations where they went, they even profaned My holy name by saying to them, These [are] the people of the Jehovah, and they are gone out of His land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.21'>But I had pity for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.22'>Therefore say to the house of Israel, So says the Lord Jehovah: I do not do [this] for your sake, O house of Israel, but for My holy name's sake, which you have profaned among the nations where you went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.23'>And I will sanctify My great name, which was profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst. And the nations shall know that I [am] the LORD, says the Lord Jehovah, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.24'>For I will take you from among the nations and gather you out of all lands, and will gather you into your own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.25'>And I will sprinkle clean waters on you, and you shall be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from your idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.26'>And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. And I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.27'>And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you shall keep My judgments and do [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.28'>And you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers. And you shall be My people, and I will be your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.29'>I will also save you from all your defilements, and I will call for the grain, and will increase it, and will lay no famine on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.30'>And I will multiply the fruits of the tree and the increase of the field, so that you shall never again receive the curse of famine among the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.31'>And you shall remember your own evil ways, and your doings that [were] not good, and shall despise yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.32'>I do not do [this] for your sake, says the Lord Jehovah, be it known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.33'>So says the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will also cause [you] to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.34'>And the waste land shall be tilled, instead of being a ruin before all passing by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.35'>And they shall say, This land that was wasted has become like the garden of Eden. And the wasted, deserted and ruined cities now [are] fortified and inhabited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.36'>And the nations that are left all around you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined [places and] plant that which was wasted. I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.37'>So says the Lord Jehovah: yet this, I will be sought by the house of Israel to act for them. I will increase them with men like a flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.38'>As a holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.37'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.1'>The hand of the LORD was on me, and brought me by the Spirit of the LORD, and made me rest in the midst of a valley, and it [was] full of bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.2'>And He made me pass among them all around. And behold, very many [were] on the face of the valley. And lo, [they were] very dry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.3'>And he said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, You know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.4'>Again He said to me, Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the Word of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.5'>So says the Lord Jehovah to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.6'>And I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.7'>So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a noise. And behold, a shaking! And the bones came near, a bone to its bone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.8'>And I watched. And behold! The sinews and the flesh came up on them, and the skin covered them above. But [there was] no breath in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.9'>And He said to me, Prophesy to the Spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the Spirit, So says the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O Spirit, and breathe on these dead ones so that they may live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.10'>So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the Spirit came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.11'>And He said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, Our bones [are] dried and our hope is lost; we are cut off by ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.12'>Therefore prophesy and say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, O My people, I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, and will bring you into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.13'>And you shall know that I [am] the LORD when I have opened your graves, O My people, and have brought you up out of your graves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.14'>And I shall put My Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. And you shall know that I the LORD have spoken and have done it, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.15'>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.16'>And you, son of man, take a stick and write on it, For Judah and for his companions, the sons of Israel. And take another stick and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and all the house of Israel, his companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.17'>And join them to one another into one stick. And they shall become one in your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.18'>And when the sons of your people shall speak to you, saying, Will you not declare to us what these [mean] to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.19'>Say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which [is] in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions, and I will put them with him, with the stick of Judah, and will make them one stick, and they shall be one in My hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.20'>And the sticks [on] which you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.21'>And say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and will gather them on every side, and will bring them into their own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.22'>And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and one King shall be king to them all. And they shall not still be two nations, nor shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.23'>Nor shall they be defiled with their idols, even with their filthy idols, nor with all of their transgressions. But I will save them out of all their dwelling places, in them where they sinned, and will cleanse them. And they shall be to Me for a people, and I will be to them for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.24'>And David My servant [shall be] King over them. And there shall be one Shepherd to all of them. And they shall walk in My judgments, and obey My laws, and do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.25'>And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob My servant, the land in which your fathers have lived. And they shall dwell in it, even they and their sons, and the sons of their sons for ever. And My servant David [shall be their ruler forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.26'>And I will cut a covenant of peace with them. It shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them, and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in their midst forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.27'>And My tabernacle shall be with them. Yea, I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.28'>And the nations shall know that I the LORD sanctify Israel, when My sanctuary shall be in their midst forever.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.38'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.1'>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.2'>Son of man, set your face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief ruler of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.3'>And say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I [am] against you, O Gog, the chief ruler of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.4'>And I will turn you back, and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed most perfectly, a great assembly [with] buckler and shield, all of them swordsmen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.5'>Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them, all of them [with] shield and helmet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.6'>Gomer and all his bands; the house of Togarmah [from] the recesses of the north, and all his bands; [and] many peoples with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.7'>Be prepared; yea, prepare for yourself, you and all your assembly that are assembled to you, and be a guard to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.8'>After many days you will be visited. In the latter years you shall come into the land turned back from the sword, gathered out of many peoples, on the mountains of Israel, which have always been waste. (But he has been brought out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely, all of them.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.9'>And you shall go up, coming like a storm. You shall be like a cloud to cover the land, you and all your bands, and many peoples with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.10'>So says the Lord Jehovah: And it shall be in that day that things shall come into your heart, and you shall devise an evil plan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.11'>And you shall say, I will go up to the land of open spaces. I will go [to] those at ease, who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and there are no bars nor gates to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.12'>in order to take a spoil, and to steal a prize; to turn your hand on the inhabited waste places, and on the people gathered out of the nations, who have gotten cattle and goods, who dwell in the midst of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.13'>Sheba and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all their young lions, shall say to you, Have you come to take a spoil? Have you gathered your company to steal a prize, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.14'>So, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, So says the Lord Jehovah: In that day when My people of Israel dwells securely, shall you not know [it] ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.15'>And you shall come from your place out of the recesses of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company and a mighty army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.16'>And you shall come up on My people Israel like a cloud, to cover the land. It shall be in the last days, and I will bring you against My land, so that the nations may know Me when I shall be sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.17'>So says the Lord Jehovah: [Are] you he of whom I have spoken in former days, by the hand of My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days [and] years that I would bring you against them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.18'>And it shall be on that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, My fury shall come up in My face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.19'>For in My jealousy [and] in the fire of My wrath I have spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great quaking in the land of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.20'>so that the fish of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep on the earth, and all the men on the face of the earth, shall quake at My presence. And the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.21'>And I will call for a sword against him on all My mountains, says the Lord Jehovah. [Each] man's sword shall be against his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.22'>And I will judge him with a plague and with blood. And I will rain on him, and on his bands, and on the many peoples with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire and brimstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.23'>So I will magnify Myself and sanctify Myself. And I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.39'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.1'>Therefore, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I [am] against you, O Gog, the chief ruler of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.2'>And I will turn you back, and lead you on. And I will bring you up from the recesses of the north, and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.3'>And I will strike your bow out of your left hand, and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.4'>You shall fall on the mountains of Israel, you and all your bands, and the people with you. I will give you for food to the birds of prey of every kind, and [to] the beasts of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.5'>You shall fall on the face of the field, for I have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.6'>And I will send a fire on Magog, and on the secure inhabitants of the coasts. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.7'>And I will make My holy name known in the midst of My people Israel. And I will not [let them] profane My holy name any more. And the nations shall know that I [am] the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.8'>Behold, it is coming, and it will be done, says the Lord Jehovah. This [is] the day of which I have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.9'>And the inhabitants of the cities of Israel shall go out and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the javelins, and the spears. And they shall burn them with fire seven years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.10'>so that they shall take no wood out of the field, nor cut down [any] out of the forests for they shall burn the weapons for fire. And they shall plunder those who plundered them, and rob those who robbed them, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.11'>And it will be in that day I will give to Gog a place there, a grave in Israel, the valley of those who pass by, east of the sea. And it shall stop the [noses] of those who pass by. And there they shall bury Gog and all his multitude. And [they] shall call [it], The Valley of the Multitude of Gog.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.12'>And the house of Israel shall bury them, to cleanse the land, seven months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.13'>And all the people of the land shall bury. And it shall be a name to them, the day when I am glorified, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.14'>And men shall separate those who continually pass through the land, burying those who passed through, who remain on the face of the earth, to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they shall search.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.15'>And [as] they pass, those who pass through the land, and [any] man sees a bone, then he shall build a post beside it, until the buriers have buried it in The Valley of the Multitude of Gog.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.16'>And also the name of the city [is] The Multitude. And they shall cleanse the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.17'>And you, son of man, So says the Lord Jehovah. Speak to the bird of every wing, and to every beast of the field: Gather yourselves and come; gather yourselves from all around to My sacrifice that I sacrifice for you, a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, so that you may eat flesh and drink blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.18'>You shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the rulers of the earth, of rams, lambs, goats, [and] bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.19'>And you shall eat fat until you are full, and drink blood until you are drunk, of My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.20'>And you shall be filled at My table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, all the men of war, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.21'>And I will set My glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see My judgments which I have done, and My hand that I have laid on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.22'>So the house of Israel shall know that I [am] Jehovah their God from that day and forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.23'>And the nations shall know that the house of Israel was exiled for their iniquity. Because they sinned against Me, therefore I hid My face from them and gave them into the hand of their enemies. So they all fell by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.24'>According to their uncleanness and according to their sins I have done to them, and have hidden My face from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.25'>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: And I will return the captivity of Jacob, and will have mercy on the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for My holy name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.26'>[after] they have borne their shame and all their sins by which they have sinned against Me, when they dwell securely in their land and no one terrifies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.27'>when I have brought them again from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.28'>then they shall know that I [am] the LORD their God who exiled them among the nations. But I have gathered them to their own land, and have not left any of them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.39.29'>Nor will I hide My face from them any more, for I have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.40'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.1'>In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was stricken, in the same day the hand of the LORD was on me, and brought me there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.2'>In the visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel, and made me rest on a very high mountain. And it went up, as the structure of the city on the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.3'>And He brought me there, and behold, a man whose appearance [was] like the look of bronze, and a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed. And he stood in the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.4'>And the man said to me, Son of man, behold with your eyes and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I shall show you. For you are brought here so that I might show them to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.5'>And behold, a wall on the outside of the house all around, and in the man's hand [was] a measuring reed, six cubits [long], with a cubit and a span. And he measured the building's breadth, one reed; and the height, one reed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.6'>And he came to the gate which faced eastward, and went up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one reed wide, even the one threshold, one reed wide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.7'>And a room [was] one reed long and one reed wide. And between the rooms [were] five cubits. And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate from the house, one reed.</verse>
