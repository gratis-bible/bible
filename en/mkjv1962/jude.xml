      <chapter osisID='Jude.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.1'>Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to the [ones] called in God [the] Father, having been set apart, and having been kept by Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.2'>Mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.3'>Having made all haste to write to you about the common salvation, beloved, I had need to write to you to exhort [you] to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.4'>For certain men crept in secretly, those having been of old previously written into this condemnation, ungodly ones perverting the grace of our God for unbridled lust, and denying the only Master, God, even our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.5'>But I intend to remind you, you once knowing these things, that the Lord having delivered a people out of the land of Egypt, in the second place destroyed the ones not believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.6'>And those angels not having kept their first place, but having deserted their dwelling-place, He has kept in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of a great Day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.7'>as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, in like manner to these, committing fornication, and going away after other flesh, laid down an example before-times, undergoing vengeance of everlasting fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.8'>Likewise, indeed, also these dreaming ones even defile flesh, and despise rulership, and speak evil of glories.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.9'>But Michael, the archangel, when contending with the Devil, he argued about the body of Moses, he dared not bring a judgment of blasphemy, but said, Let the Lord rebuke you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.10'>But what things they do not know, they speak evil of. And what things they understand naturally, like the animals without reason, they are corrupted by these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.11'>Woe to them! For they went the way of Cain, and gave themselves up to the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.12'>These are sunken rocks in your love feasts, feasting together with you; feeding themselves without fear; waterless clouds being carried about by winds; fruitless autumn trees, having died twice, having been plucked up by the roots;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.13'>wild waves of the sea foaming up their shames; wandering stars for whom blackness of darkness has been kept forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.14'>And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, also prophesied to these, saying, Behold, the Lord came with myriads of His saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.15'>to do judgment against all, and to rebuke all the ungodly of them concerning all their ungodly works which they ungodly did, and concerning all the hard things ungodly sinners spoke against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.16'>These are murmurers, complainers, leading lives according to their lusts. And their mouth speaks proud things, admiring faces for the sake of gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.17'>But you, beloved, remember the words spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.18'>because they told you that at [the] last time there will be mockers according to their lusts, leading ungodly lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.19'>These are those setting themselves apart, animal-like ones, not having the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.20'>But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.21'>keep yourselves in the love of God, eagerly awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.22'>But pity some, making distinction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.23'>But save others with fear, snatching [them] out of the fire; hating even the garment having been stained from the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.24'>Now to Him being able to keep you without stumbling, and to set you before His glory without blemish, with unspeakable joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.25'>to the only wise God, our Savior, [be] glory and majesty and might and authority, even now and forever. Amen.</verse>
