      <chapter osisID='1Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the command of God our Savior, and of [the] Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, [my] own son in [the] faith. Grace, mercy and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>Even as I begged you to remain at Ephesus, when I was going to Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies (which provide doubts rather than the] nurture of God in faith).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>But the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>from which some, having swerved, have turned aside to foolish talking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>desiring to be teachers of the law, neither understanding what they say nor that which they affirm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>But we know that the law [is] good if a man uses it lawfully,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>knowing this, that the law [is] not made for a righteous one, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>for fornicators, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and anything else that is contrary to sound doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who strengthened me, because He counted me faithful, putting [me] into the ministry--</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>the [one] who before was a blasphemer and a persecutor and insolent. But I obtained mercy, because being ignorant, I did [it] in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>[And] the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>Faithful [is] the Word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>But for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, as a pattern to those being about to believe on Him to life everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, [the] only wise God, [be] honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>This charge I commit to you, [my] son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before [about] you, in order that you might war a good warfare by them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>holding faith and a good conscience, which some have put away and made shipwreck as to faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>Among these are Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>First of all, then, I exhort [that] supplications, prayers, intercessions, [and] giving of thanks be made for all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>For this [is] good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>who will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>For God [is] one, and [there is] one Mediator of God and of man, [the] Man Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>To this I am ordained a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie), a teacher of [the] nations, in faith and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>Therefore, I desire that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>In the same way also, I desire that women adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and sensibleness, not [adorned] with braiding, or gold, or pearls, or costly clothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>but with good works, which becomes women professing godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>But I do not allow a woman to teach, or to exercise authority [over] a man, but to be in silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>And Adam was not deceived, but [the] woman being deceived was in the transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'>But she will be kept safe through childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with sensibleness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>Faithful [is] the word: If anyone reaches out to overseership, he desires a good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>Then it behooves the overseer to be without reproach, husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, well-ordered, hospitable, apt at teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>not a drunkard, not contentious, not greedy of ill gain, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>ruling his own house well, having children in subjection with all honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>(For if a man does not know to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>not a novice, lest being puffed up he may fall into the condemnation of the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>But he must also have a good report from those on the outside, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>Likewise the deacons [are to be] reverent, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of ill gain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>having the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>And let these also first be tested, then let them minister without reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>Even so [their] wives are to [be] reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling [their] children and households well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>For they having served well gain a good grade for themselves, and much boldness in the faith, those in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>I write these things to you, hoping to come to you shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>But if I should delay, that you may know how you ought to behave in the house of God, which is [the] church of the living God, [the] pillar and foundation of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among nations, believed on in [the] world, and received up into glory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>But the Spirit expressly says that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>speaking lies in hypocrisy, being seared in [their] own conscience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>forbidding to marry, [saying] to abstain from foods which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>For every creation of God [is] good, and nothing to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>For it is sanctified through the Word of God and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>Having suggested these things to the brothers, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and by the good doctrine which you have followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>But refuse profane and old-womanish tales, and exercise yourself to godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the present life, and of that which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>Faithful [is] the Word, and worthy of all acceptance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>For to this we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the preserver of all men, especially of those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>Command and teach these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>Let no one despise your youth, but be an example of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>Until I come, attend to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Do not neglect the gift in you, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the body of elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>Meditate on these things; be in these things in order that your improvement may appear to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>Hold on to yourself and to the doctrine; continue in them, for doing this you shall both save yourself and those who hear you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>Do not sharply rebuke an elder, but exhort as a father, [and] the younger ones as brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>older women as mothers, the younger as sisters in all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>Honor widows who are widows indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to be godly to their own house, and give back to [their] forebears what is due them; for that is good and pleasing before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>But she being really a widow, and having been left alone, has set her] hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>But she who lives in self-pleasure has died while living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>And command these things so that they may be blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>But if anyone does not provide for [his] own, and especially [his] family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>Do not let a widow be enrolled having become less than sixty years old, [the] wife of one man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>well reported of for good works: if she brought up children, if she lodged strangers, if she washed the feet of saints, if she relieved the afflicted, if she followed after every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>But refuse younger widows, for whenever they grow lustful against Christ, they desire to marry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>having guilt because they have cast off the first faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>And with it all they also learn [to be] idle, going around the houses; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things they ought not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>Therefore I want the younger ones to marry, bear children, guide the house, giving no occasion to the adversary because of reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>For some have already turned aside after Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>If any believing man or believing woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be charged, so that it may relieve those who are widows indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle the ox treading out grain, and, The laborer [is] worthy of his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Do not receive an accusation against an elder except before two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>Those who sin, rebuke before all, so that the rest also may fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>I charge [you] before God and [the] Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you guard these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>Do not lay hands quickly on anyone, neither be partaker of [the] sins of others. Keep yourself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>Drink water no longer, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake, and for your frequent infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment. And some they also follow after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand, and those who are otherwise cannot be hidden.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>Let as many slaves as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name and doctrine of God may not be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>And those who have believing masters, let them not despise [them] because they are brothers. But rather let them serve, because they are faithful and beloved, those of the good service receiving in return. Teach and exhort these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>If anyone teaches otherwise, and does not consent to wholesome words (those of our Lord Jesus Christ), and to the doctrine according to godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>he is proud, knowing nothing. [He is] sick concerning doubts and arguments, from which comes envy, strife, evil speakings, evil suspicions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>meddling, of men whose minds have been corrupted and deprived of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness. Withdraw from such.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>But godliness with contentment is great gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>For we brought nothing into the world, [and it is] clear that we can carry nothing out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>But having food and clothing, we will be content.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>But they who will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and [into] many foolish and hurtful lusts which plunge men into destruction and perdition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>For the love of money is a root of all evils, of which some having lusted after, they were seduced from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>But you, O man of God, flee these things and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold on eternal life, to which you are also called and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>I charge you before God (who makes all things alive) and [in the sight of] Christ Jesus (who witnessed the good confession to Pontius Pilate),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>that you keep the commandment without spot and without blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>For He in His own time will reveal [who is] the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>who alone has immortality, dwelling in light which cannot be approached, whom no one of men have seen, nor can see; to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>Charge the rich in this world that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, He offering to us richly all things to enjoy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to share, to be generous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>O Timothy, guard the Deposit, avoiding profane [and] vain babblings, and oppositions of falsely-named science,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace [be] with you. Amen.</verse>
