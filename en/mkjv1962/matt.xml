      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, [the] son of David, [the] son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham fathered Isaac, and Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>And Judah fathered Pharez and Zarah of Tamar. And Pharez fathered Hezron, and Hezron fathered Ram,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>and Ram fathered Amminadab, and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>And Salmon fathered Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed of Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse fathered David the king. And David the king fathered Solomon of [her who had been] wife of Uriah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>And Solomon fathered Rehoboam, and Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>And Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat fathered Jehoram, and Jehoram fathered Uzziah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>And Uzziah fathered Jotham, and Jotham fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>And Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, and Manasseh fathered Amon, and Amon fathered Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>And Josiah fathered Jehoiachin and his brothers, at the time they were carried away to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the carrying away to Babylon, Jehoiachin fathered Shealtiel, and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>And Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, and Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>And Azor fathered Sadoc, and Sadoc fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>And Eliud fathered Eleazar, and Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>And Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband [to be] of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham to David [are] fourteen generations. And from David until the carrying away into Babylon, fourteen generations. And from the carrying away into Babylon until Christ, fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was this way (for His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph) before they came together, she was found to be with child by [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>But Joseph, her husband [to be], being just, and not willing to make her a public example, he purposed to put her away secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>And as he thought upon these things, behold, the angel of [the] Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take to you Mary [as] your wife. For that in her is fathered of [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she shall bear a son, and you shall call His name JESUS: for He shall save His people from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this happened so that might be fulfilled that which was] spoken of the LORD by the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>Behold, the virgin shall conceive in [her] womb, and will bear a son. And they will call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>And Joseph, being roused from sleep, did as the angel of [the] Lord commanded him and took his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>and did not know her until she bore her son, the First-born. And he called His name JESUS.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in [the] days of Herod the king, behold, wise men came from [the] east to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>saying, Where is He [who is] born king of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the east and have come to worship Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>But when Herod the king heard these [things], he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea. For so it is written by the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And you, Bethlehem, [in] the land of Judah, are not the least among the governors of Judah. For out of you shall come a Governor who shall rule My people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, inquired of them exactly what time the star appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child. And when you have found [him], bring me word again so that I may come and worship him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>When they had heard the king, they departed. And lo, the star which they saw in the east went before them until it came and stood over where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>And seeing the star, they rejoiced [with] exceedingly great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And coming into the house, they saw the child with Mary His mother. And they fell down and worshiped Him. And opening their treasures, they presented gifts to Him, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>And when they had departed, behold, the angel of [the] Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and His mother and flee into Egypt. And be there until I bring you word, for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>And he was there until the death of Herod; so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the LORD through the prophet, Out of Egypt I have called My Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was greatly enraged. And he sent and killed all the boys in Bethlehem, and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had carefully inquired of the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping [for] her children, and would not be comforted, because they are [not].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But Herod having expired, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>saying, Arise, and take the child and His mother. And go into [the] land of Israel. For the ones who sought the child's life are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And he arose and took the child and His mother and came into [the] land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Archelaus reigned in Judea in his father Herod's place, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And he came and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of [one] crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of [the] Lord, make His paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>And the same John had his clothing of camel's hair and a leather girdle about his loins. And his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then Jerusalem and all Judea went out to him, and all the region round about Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>And they were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and do not think to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as [our] father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>And now also, the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. But He who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He shall baptize you with [the] Holy Spirit and [with] fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>whose fan [is] in His hand, and He will cleanse His floor and gather His wheat into the storehouse; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus came from Galilee to Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John restrained Him, saying, I have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>And answering Jesus said to him, Allow [it] now, for it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allowed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And Jesus, when He had been baptized, went up immediately out of the water. And lo, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And lo, a voice from Heaven, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led by the Spirit up into the wilderness, to be tempted by the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He was afterwards hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And when the tempter came to Him, he said, If You are [the] Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But He answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of [the] mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the Devil took Him up into the holy city and set Him upon a pinnacle of the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>And [he] said to Him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down. For it is written, He shall give His angels charge concerning You, and in [their] hands they shall bear You up, lest at any time You dash Your foot against a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, It is written again, You shall not tempt [the] Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again, the Devil took Him up into a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>And [he] said to Him, All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus said to him, Go, Satan! For it is written, You shall worship [the] Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the Devil left him. And behold, angels came and ministered to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>But when Jesus heard that John was thrown into prison, He went back into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And leaving Nazareth, He came and lived in Capernaum, which is on the seacoast, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, [by] way of [the] sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people who sat in darkness saw a great Light; and Light has sprung up to those who sat in [the] region and shadow of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent! For the kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And walking by the Sea of Galilee, Jesus saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea. For they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And He said to them, Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And they immediately left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And going on from there, he saw another two brothers, James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And He called them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>and they immediately left the boat and their father and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And His fame went throughout all Syria. And they brought to Him all those being badly ill] suffering various diseases and torments, and [those] who had been possessed with demons, and those who had been moonstruck, and paralytics. And He healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And great multitudes of people followed Him, from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>And seeing the multitudes, He went up into a mountain. And when He had sat down, His disciples came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>And He opened His mouth and taught them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>Blessed [are] the poor in spirit! For theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed [are] they that mourn! For they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed [are] the meek! For they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed [are] they who hunger and thirst after righteousness! For they shall be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed [are] the merciful! For they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed [are] the pure in heart! For they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed [are] the peacemakers! For they shall be called the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed [are] they who have been persecuted for righteousness sake! For theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Blessed are you when [men] shall revile you and persecute [you], and shall say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for My sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for your reward in Heaven [is] great. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its savor, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything, but to be thrown out and to be trodden underfoot by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Nor do men light a lamp and put it under the grain-measure, but on a lampstand. And it gives light to all who are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Do not think that I have come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to destroy but to fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For truly I say to you, Till the heaven and the earth pass away, not one jot or one tittle shall in any way pass from the law until all is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Therefore whoever shall break one of these commandments, the least, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of Heaven. But whoever shall do and teach [them], the same shall be called great in the kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say to you that unless your righteousness shall exceed [that] of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>You have heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not kill --and, Whoever shall kill shall be liable to the judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be liable to the judgment. And whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the sanhedrin; but whoever shall say, Fool! shall be liable [to be thrown] into the fire of hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Therefore if you offer your gift on the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are in the way with him; that the opponent not deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until you have paid the last kodrantes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>You have heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you that whoever looks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>And if your right eye offends you, pluck it out and throw [it] from you. For it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not [that] your whole body should be thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if your right hand offends you, cut it off and throw [it] from you. For it is profitable for you [that] one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>It was also said, Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say to you that whoever shall put away his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery. And whoever shall marry her who is put away commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Again, you have heard that it has been said to the ancients, You shall not swear falsely, but you shall perform your oaths to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I say to you, Do not swear at all! Not by Heaven, because it is God's throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>not by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet; not by Jerusalem, because it is [the] city of the great King;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no. For whatever is more than these comes from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say to you, Do not resist evil. But whoever shall strike you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And to him desiring to sue you, and to take away your tunic, let him have [your] coat also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And whoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to him who asks of you, and you shall not turn away from him who would borrow from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who despitefully use you and persecute you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>so that you may become sons of your Father in Heaven. For He makes His sun to rise on [the] evil and on [the] good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax-collectors do the same?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>Take heed that you do not do your merciful deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward with your Father in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>Therefore when you do [your] merciful deeds, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have glory from men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But when you do merciful deeds, do not let your left hand know what your right hand does,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>so that your merciful deeds may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret Himself shall reward you openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But you, when you pray, enter into your room. And shutting your door, pray to your Father in secret; and your Father who sees in secret shall reward you openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>But when you pray, do not babble vain words, as the nations. For they think that in their much speaking they shall be heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows what things you have need of, before you ask Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>Therefore pray in this way: Our Father, who is in Heaven, Hallowed be Your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as [it is] in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>Give us this day our daily bread;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.12'>and forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.13'>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil. For Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.14'>For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.15'>but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>And when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, of a sad face. For they disfigure their faces so that they may appear to men to fast. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.17'>But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.18'>so that you do not appear to men to fast, but to your Father in secret. And your Father who sees in secret shall reward you openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.19'>Do not lay up treasures on earth for yourselves, where moth and rust corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.20'>But lay up treasures in Heaven for yourselves, where neither moth nor rust corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.21'>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.22'>The light of the body is the eye. Therefore if your eye is sound, your whole body shall be full of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.23'>But if your eye is evil, your whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light [that is] in you is darkness, how great [is] that darkness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.24'>No one can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>Therefore I say to you, Do not be anxious for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor for your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.26'>Behold the birds of the air; for they sow not, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns. Yet your heavenly Father feeds them; are you not much better than they are?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.27'>Which of you [by] being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.28'>And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They do not toil, nor do they spin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.29'>but I say to you that even Solomon in his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.30'>Therefore if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, [will He] not much rather [clothe] you, little-faiths?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.32'>For the nations seek after all these things. For your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.33'>But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow; for tomorrow shall be anxious for its own things. Sufficient to the day [is] the evil of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.7.11'>If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father in Heaven give good things to those who ask Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.12'>Therefore all things, whatever you desire that men should do to you, do even so to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.13'>Go in through the narrow gate, for wide [is] the gate and broad [is] the way that leads to destruction, and many there are who go in through it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.7.15'>Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.16'>You shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>And Jesus put [out] His hand and touched him, saying, I will; be clean! And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>And Jesus said to him, See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest. And offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>And when Jesus had entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, beseeching Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>and saying, Lord, my son lies at home paralyzed and grievously tormented.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>And Jesus says to him, I will come and heal him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; but only speak the word, and my boy will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go! And he goes; and to another, Come! And he comes; and to my servant, Do this! And he does [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>When Jesus heard, He marvelled and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you, I have not found such [great] faith, no, not in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>And I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of Heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>And when Jesus had come into Peter's house, He saw his wife's mother laid out and in a fever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>And He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>And evening coming on, they brought to Him many who had been possessed with demons. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>And lo, some of the scribes said within themselves, This one blasphemes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why do you think evil in your hearts?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>But when the crowds saw, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax-office. And He said to him, Follow Me! And he arose and followed Him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.23'>Therefore the kingdom of Heaven has been compared to a certain king who desired to make an accounting with his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.24'>And when he had begun to count, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.25'>But as he had nothing to pay, his lord commanded that he, and his wife and children, and all that he had, be sold, and payment be made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.26'>Then the servant fell down and worshiped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me and I will pay you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.27'>Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and released him and forgave him the debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.28'>But the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. And he laid hands on him and took [him] by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.29'>And his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, Have patience with me and I will pay you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.30'>And he would not, but went and cast him into prison until he should pay the debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.31'>So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were very sorry. And they came and told their lord all that was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.32'>Then his lord, after he had called him, said to him, O wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.33'>Should you not also have pitied your fellow servant, even as I had pity on you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.34'>And his lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors until he should pay all that was due to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.35'>So likewise shall My heavenly Father do also to you, unless each one of you from your hearts forgive his brother their trespasses.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>But they said, Not on the feast [day], lest there be an uproar among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>And when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>a woman came to Him, having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured [it] on His head as He reclined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>But when His disciples saw [it], they were indignant, saying, To what purpose [is] this waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>For this ointment might have been sold for very much and given to [the] poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>When Jesus understood [it], He said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work on Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For you have the poor with you always, but you do not always have Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For in putting ointment on My body, she did [it] for My burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be proclaimed in the whole world, that which this woman has done shall be spoken of also, for a memorial of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>And he said [to them], What will you give me, and I will betray Him to you? And they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>And on the first [day] of the [Feast of] Unleavened [Bread], the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, Where do You desire that we prepare for You to eat the Passover?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>And He said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Master said, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them. And they made the passover ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>And when evening had come, He sat down with the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>And as they ate, He said, Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>And grieving sorrowfully, they began to say, each one of them, Lord, not I am [the one] ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>And He answered and said, He who dips [his] hand with Me in the dish, the same shall betray Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of man goes, as it has been written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>And answering, the [one] betraying Him, Judas, said, Master, Not am I [the one]? He said to him, You said [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed [it], and broke [it], and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat, this is My body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>And He took the cup and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, Drink all of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>And singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then Jesus said to them, All of you will be offended because of Me this night. For it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after I have risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>Peter answered and said to Him, though all shall be offended because of You, I will never be offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that this night, before the cock crows, you shall deny Me three times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter said to Him, though I should die with You, yet I will not deny You. All the disciples also said the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane. And He said to the disciples, Sit here while I go and pray there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with Him, and He began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Wait here and watch with Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And He went a little further and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me. Yet not as I will, but as You [will].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>And He came to the disciples and found them asleep. And [He] said to Peter, What! Could you not watch with Me one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>He went away again the second time and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cup may not pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>And He left them and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then He came to His disciples and said to them, Sleep on now and take [your] rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into [the] hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Rise, let us be going; behold, he who is betraying Me is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>And as He was yet speaking, behold, Judas came, one of the Twelve. And with him came a great crowd with swords and clubs, being sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>And he who betrayed Him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, He is the one, lay hold on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And coming up to Jesus immediately, he said, Hail, Master! And [he] kissed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>And Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you here? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And, behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out [his] hand and drew his sword, and he struck a servant of the high priest and [cut] off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then Jesus said to him, Put up your sword again into its place; for all who take [the] sword shall perish with a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He shall presently give Me more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Have you come out in order to take Me with swords and clubs, as against a thief? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not lay hands on Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this happened that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples fled, forsaking Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>And they who had seized Jesus led [Him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Peter followed Him afar off to the high priest's court, and he went in and sat with the servants to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>And the chief priests and the elders and all the sanhedrin sought false witness against Jesus, in order to put Him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>But they found none; yea, though many false witnesses came, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came up</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>and said, This one said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And standing up, the high priest said to Him, Do you answer nothing? What [is it that] these witness against you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus was silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, I adjure you by the living God that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus said to him, You said [it]. I tell you more. From this time you shall see the Son of man sitting on [the] right [hand] of power, and coming on the clouds of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What do you think? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spat in His face and beat Him with the fist. And others struck [Him] with the palms of their hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, Prophesy to us, Christ; who is the [one] who struck you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>And Peter sat outside in the court. And a girl came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied all before [them], saying, I do not know what you say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And when he had gone out into the porch, another saw him and said to those there, This one was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>And after a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, Surely you also are [one] of them, for your speech betrays you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to curse and to swear, I do not know the man. And immediately the cock crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, Who said to him, Before the cock crows, you shall deny Me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>And [it] becoming early morning, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>And when they had bound Him, they led [Him] away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then he who had betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, sorrowing, Judas returned the thirty pieces of silver again to the chief priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>saying, I have sinned, betraying innocent blood. And they said, What [is that] to us? You see [to that].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And he threw the pieces of silver down in the temple and departed. And he went and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is [the] price of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>And they took counsel and bought the potter's field with them, to bury strangers in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Therefore that field was called, The Field of Blood, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who had been priced, whom they of the children of Israel valued,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>And Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked Him, saying, Are you the king of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, You say [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>And when He was accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to Him, Do you not hear how many things they witness against you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>And He did not answer him a word, so that the governor greatly marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now at [that] feast the governor was accustomed to release to the people a prisoner, whomever they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>And they then had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you desire that I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus [who is] called Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For he knew they had delivered Him because of envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>But as he was sitting down on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that just man, for today because of Him I have suffered many things in a dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd that they should ask [for] Barabbas and destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>The governor answered and said to them, Which of the two do you desire that I release [to] you? They said, Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate said to them, What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? [They] all said to him, Let Him be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>And the governor said, Why? What evil has He done? But they cried out the more, saying, let Him be crucified!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>But when Pilate saw that it gained nothing, but rather [that] a tumult was made, he took water and washed [his] hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person. You see to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>Then all the people answered and said, Let His blood [be] on us and on our children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released Barabbas to them. And when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered [Him] to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then taking Jesus into the praetorium, the soldiers of the governor gathered the cohort against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>And stripping Him, they put a scarlet robe around Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>And plaiting a crown of thorns, they put [it] on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they bowed the knee before Him and mocked Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And spitting at Him, [they] took the reed and struck at His head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And after they had mocked Him, they took the robe off of Him and put His own clothing on Him and led Him away to crucify [Him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They forced this one to carry His cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And coming to a place called Golgotha, which is called, Place of a Skull,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they gave Him vinegar mixed with gall to drink. And when He had tasted, He would not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And they crucified Him, dividing His garments, casting a lot; so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted My garments among them, and they cast a lot for My clothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And sitting down they guarded Him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And they put up over His head His accusation, written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then two thieves were crucified with Him, one off [the] right, one off [the] left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>And those who passed by blasphemed Him, shaking their heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, [You] destroying the temple and building [it] in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>And in the same way also the chief priests mocked, with the scribes and elders, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>He saved others, but he cannot save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusted in God, let Him deliver him now, if He will have him. (For He said, I am [the] Son of God.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>And also the thieves who were crucified with Him reviled Him, [saying] the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>And from [the] sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until [the] ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? That is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>Some of those who stood there, when they heard, said, This one calls for Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar, and he put [it] on a reed and gave it to Him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>The rest said, Let Him alone, let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>And crying again with a loud voice, Jesus released [His] spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And, behold! The veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. And the earth quaked, and the rocks were sheared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep arose,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and coming out of the tomb after His resurrection [they] went into the holy city and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>But the centurion and those guarding Jesus, seeing the earthquake, and the things that took place, [they] feared greatly, saying, Truly this One was Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>And many of the women were there, watching from a distance, [those] who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him, watching from a distance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>When the evening had come, a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, came, who also himself was Jesus' disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>He went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>When Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in clean linen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and laid it in his new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>And Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, were sitting there across from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>And on the next day, which was after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while He was living, After three days I will rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Then command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say to the people, He has risen from the dead. So the last error will be worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, You have a watch. Go and make [it] as secure as you can.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>And going they made the tomb secure, sealing the stone along with the guard.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>But late in the week, at the dawning into the first [day] of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And behold, a great earthquake occurred! For coming down from Heaven, and coming up, an angel of [the] Lord rolled back the stone from the door and [was] sitting on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>And the keepers shook for fear of him and became like dead [men].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>And the angel answered and said to the women, Do not fear, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here, for He has risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead. And, behold, He goes before you into Galilee. There you shall see Him. Lo, I have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And they quickly departed from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring His disciples word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>But as they were going to report to His disciples, behold, Jesus also met them, saying, Hail! And they came and held Him by the feet and worshiped Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid; go tell My brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>And as they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and declared all the things that were done to the chief priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>And being assembled with the elders, and taking counsel, [they] gave enough silver to the soldiers,</verse>
