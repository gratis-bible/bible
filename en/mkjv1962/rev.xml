      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>A Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to Him to declare to His servants things which must shortly come to pass. And He signified [it] by sending His angel to His servant John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>who bore record of the Word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all the things that he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed [is] the [one] who reads and hears the words of this prophecy, and the ones keeping the things written in it, for the time [is] near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who [is] coming; and from the seven spirits which are before His throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>even from Jesus Christ the faithful Witness, the First-born from the dead and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and made us kings and priests to God and His Father, to Him [be] glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, and those who pierced Him will see Him, and all the kindreds of the earth will wail because of Him. Even so, Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>I am the Alpha and Omega, [the] Beginning and [the] Ending, says the Lord, who is and who was and who [is] to come, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I, John, [who] also [am] your brother and companion in the affliction, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the island that is called Patmos, for the Word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I came to be in [the] Spirit in the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>saying, I am the Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last. Also, What you see, write in a book and send [it] to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands. And in the midst of the seven lampstands I saw [One] like [the] Son of man, clothed with a garment down to [the] feet, and tied around the breast with a golden band.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>His head and hair [were] white like wool, as white as snow. And His eyes [were] like a flame of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>And His feet were like burnished brass having been fired in a furnace. And His voice was like the sound of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>And He had seven stars in His right hand, and out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword. And His face [was] like the sun shining in its strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. And He laid His right hand upon me, saying to me, Do not fear, I am the First and the Last,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>and the Living One, and I became dead, and behold, I am alive for ever and ever, Amen. And I have the keys of hell and of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be after this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand and the seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>To the angel of the church of Ephesus write: He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands, says these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know your works and your labor and your patience, and how you cannot bear those who are evil. And [you] tried those pretending to be apostles, and are not, and have found them liars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>And [you] have borne, and have patience, and for My name's sake you have labored and have not fainted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>But I have against you that you left your first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent, and do the first works, or else I will come to you quickly and will remove your lampstand out of its place unless you repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But you have this, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: The First and the Last, who became dead and lived, says these things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I know your works and tribulation and poverty (but you are rich), and [I know] the blasphemy of those saying themselves to be Jews, and are not, but [are] the synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Do not at all fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the Devil will cast [some] of you into prison, so that you may be tried. And you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write: He who has the sharp sword with two edges says these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I know your works, and where you live, [even] where Satan's seat [is]. And you hold fast My name and have not denied My faith, even in those days in which Antipas [was] My faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold the teachings of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>So you also have those who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Repent! But if not I will come to you quickly, and will fight with them by the sword of My mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give to him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows except he who receives [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: The Son of God, He who has His eyes like a flame of fire and His feet like burnished metal, says these things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know your works and love and service and faith and your patience, and your works; and the last [to be] more than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have a few things against you because you allow that woman Jezebel to teach, she saying herself [to be] a prophetess, and to cause My servants to go astray, and to commit fornication, and to eat idol-sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I gave her time that she might repent of her fornication, and she did not repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Behold, I am throwing her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great affliction, unless they repent of their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>And I will kill her children with death. And all the churches will know that I am He who searches the reins and hearts, and I will give to every one of you according to your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak, I will put on you no other burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>But that which you have, hold fast until I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>And he who overcomes and keeps My works to the end, to him I will give power over the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>And he will rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels [of a potter] they will be broken to pieces, even as I received from My Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>And I will give him the Morning Star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars says these things. I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die. For I have not found your works being fulfilled before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Remember then how you have received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. Therefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>You have a few names even in Sardis who have not defiled their garments. And they will walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>The one who overcomes, this one will be clothed in white clothing. And I will not blot out his name out of the Book of Life, but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: He who is holy, He who is true, He who has the key of David, He who opens and no one shuts; and shuts and no one opens, says these things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>I know your works. Behold, I have given before you an open door, and no one can shut it. For you have a little strength and have kept My word and have not denied My name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Behold, I give out of those of the synagogue of Satan, those saying themselves to be Jews and are not, but lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because you have kept the word of My patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation which will come upon all the habitable world, to try those who dwell upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>Behold, I come quickly. Hold fast to that which you have, so that no one may take your crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>Him who overcomes I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will go out no more. And I will write upon him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of Heaven from My God, and My new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>And to the angel of the church of the Laodicea write: The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Head of the creation of God, says these things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I would that you were cold or hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>So because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because you say, I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I counsel you to buy from Me gold purified by fire, so that you may be rich; and white clothing, so that you may be clothed, and [so that] the shame of your nakedness does not appear. And anoint your eyes with eye salve, so that you may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; therefore be zealous and repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him and he with Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame and have sat down with My Father in His throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After these things I looked, and behold, a door [was] opened in Heaven. And the first voice which I heard [was] as it were of a trumpet talking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you what must occur after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>And immediately I became in spirit. And behold, a throne was set in Heaven, and [One] sat upon the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>And He who sat there looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. And a rainbow [was] around the throne, looking like an emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>And around the throne [I saw] twenty-four thrones. And on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white clothing. And they had crowns of gold on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And out of the throne came lightnings and thunderings and voices. And seven lamps of fire [were] burning in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>And a sea of glass [was] in front of the throne, like crystal. And in [the] midst of the throne, and around the throne, [were] four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>And the first living creature [was] like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And each one of the four living creatures had six wings about [him], and within being full of eyes. And they had no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God, the Almighty, who was and is and [is] to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And whenever the living creatures gave glory and honor and thanks to Him who sat on the throne, who lives forever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the twenty-four elders fell down before the One sitting on the throne. And they worshiped Him who lives for ever and ever, and threw their crowns before the throne, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>O Lord, You are worthy to receive glory and honor and power, because You created all things, and for Your will they are and were created.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw a book on the right of Him sitting on the throne, written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book and to loosen its seals?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no one in Heaven, nor on the earth, nor under the earth, was able to open the book or to look at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I wept very much, because no one was found worthy to open and to read the book, nor to look at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>And one of the elders said to me, Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I looked, and lo, in [the] midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, amidst the elders, a Lamb stood, as if it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>And He came and took the book out of the right [hand] of Him sitting on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when He had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having harps and golden vials full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they sang a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book and to open its seals, for You were slain and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>And You made us kings and priests to our God, and we will reign over the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>And I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, and the living creatures and the elders. And the number of them was myriads and myriads, and thousands of thousands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And I heard every creature which is in the Heaven and on the earth, and under the earth, and those that are in the sea, and all who are in them, saying, Blessing and honor and glory and power be to Him sitting on the throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped [the] One living forever and ever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures like a sound of thunder, saying, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I saw. And behold a white horse! And he sitting on it had a bow. And a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when He had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And another, a red horse, went out. And power was given to him sitting on it, to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. And there was given to him a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when He had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come and see. And I looked, and lo, a black horse. And he sitting on it had a balance in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard a voice in [the] midst of the four living creatures say, A choenix of wheat [for] a denarius, and three choenixes of barley [for] a denarius. And do not hurt the oil and the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when He had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him sitting on it [was] Death, and Hell followed with him. And authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and by the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, Until when, Master, holy and true, do You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And white robes were given to each one of them. And it was said to them that they should rest yet for a little time, until both their fellow servants and their brothers (those about to be killed as they [were] ) should have their number made complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And when He had opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold, there was a great earthquake. And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, even as a fig tree casts her untimely figs when she is shaken by a mighty wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>And [the] heaven departed like a scroll when it is rolled together. And every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>And they said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us and hide us from [the] face of Him sitting on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>for the great day of His wrath has come, and who will be able to stand?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth so that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>saying, Do not hurt the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred [and] forty-four thousands, having been sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.15.2'>And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire. And those who had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, [and] over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.3'>And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous [are] Your works, Lord God Almighty, just and true [are] Your ways, O King of saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.4'>Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You only [are] holy. For all nations shall come and worship before You, for Your righteousnesses were made known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.5'>And after these things I looked, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony was opened in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.6'>And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and were tied at the breasts with golden bands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.7'>And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.8'>And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from His authority. And no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.16'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.1'>And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the vials of the anger of God on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.2'>And the first went and poured out his vial on the earth. And a bad and grievous sore fell on the men who had the mark of the beast, and [on] those who worshiped his image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.3'>And the second angel poured out his vial on the sea. And it became like the blood of a dead one, and every living soul died in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.4'>And the third angel poured out his vial on the rivers and fountains of waters, and they became blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.5'>And I heard the angel of the waters say, Righteous is the Lord, who is, and was, and who will be, because You have judged these things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.6'>since they have poured out the blood of the saints and prophets; and You gave them blood to drink, for they were deserving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.7'>And I heard another out of the altar saying, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous [are] Your judgments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.8'>And the fourth angel poured out his vial onto the sun. And it was given to him to burn men with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.9'>And men were burned with great heat. And they blasphemed the name of God, He having authority over these plagues. And they did not repent in order to give Him glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.10'>And the fifth angel poured out his vial on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom became darkened. And they gnawed their tongues from the pain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.11'>And they blasphemed the God of Heaven because of their pains and their sores. And they did not repent of their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.12'>And the sixth angel poured out his vial on the great river Euphrates. And its water was dried up, so that the way of the kings from [the] rising of [the] sun might be prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.13'>And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs [come] out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.14'>For they are spirits of demons, working miracles, [which] go forth to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that day, the great day of God Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.15'>Behold, I am coming as a thief. Blessed [is] the [one] who watches and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.16'>And he gathered them into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.17'>And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air. And a great voice came out of the temple of Heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.18'>And voices and thunders and lightnings occurred. And there was a great earthquake, such as has not been since men were on the earth, so mighty [and] so great an earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.19'>And the great city came to be into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And great Babylon was remembered before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the anger of His wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.20'>And every island fled away, and mountains were not found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.21'>And a great hail, as the size of a talent, came down out of the heaven on men. And men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague of it was exceedingly great.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.17'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.1'>And one of the seven angels who had the seven vials came and talked with me, saying to me, Come here, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot sitting on many waters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.2'>with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and became drunk with the wine of her fornication, those inhabiting the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.3'>And he carried me away into a desert by [the] Spirit. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored beast, filled with names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.4'>And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet. And she was gilded with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.5'>And on her forehead [was] a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.6'>And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I marveled with a great marveling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.7'>And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, that has the seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.8'>The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to ascend out of the abyss and go into perdition. And those dwelling on the earth will marvel, those whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.9'>[And] here [is] the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.10'>And there are seven kings; five have fallen, and one is, [and] the other has not yet come. And when he comes, he must continue a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.11'>And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.12'>And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have received no kingdom yet, but will receive authority as kings one hour with the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.13'>These have one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.14'>These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them. For He is Lord of lords and King of kings. And those with Him [are] the called and elect and faithful ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.15'>And he says to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.16'>and the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked. And they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.17'>For God gave into their hearts to do His mind, and to act with one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God will be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.18'>And the woman whom you saw is the great city which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.18'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.1'>And after these things I saw another angel come down from Heaven, having great authority. And the earth was lighted up from his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.2'>And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great has fallen, has fallen! And it has become the dwelling-place of demons, and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a cage of every unclean bird which has been hated,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.3'>because of the wine of the anger of her fornication which all the nations have drunk. And the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her. And the merchants of the earth became rich from the power of her luxury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.4'>And I heard another voice from Heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people, that you may not be partakers of her sins, and that you may not receive of her plagues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.5'>For her sins joined together, even up to Heaven, and God has remembered her unjust deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.6'>Reward her as she has rewarded you, and double to her double, according to her works. In the cup which she mixed, mix double to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.7'>As much as she has glorified herself and has lived in luxury, so much torment and sorrow give her. For she says in her heart, I sit as a queen, and I am not a widow; and I do not see mourning at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.8'>Therefore her plagues will come in one day, death and mourning and famine. And she will be consumed with fire, for the Lord God who judges her [is] strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.9'>And the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived in luxury with her will weep for her, and will wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.10'>standing afar off for fear of her torment, saying, Woe! Woe to the great city, Babylon, that strong city! For in one hour your judgment came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.11'>And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their cargo any more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.12'>the cargo of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and every ivory vessel, and every vessel of very precious wood, and of bronze, and of iron, and of marble,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.13'>and cinnamon, and incenses, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.14'>And the fruits of the lust of your soul have departed from you, and all the fat things and the bright things departed from you, and you will find them no more, not at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.15'>The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, will stand afar off because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.16'>and saying, Woe! Woe to the great city which was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.17'>For in one hour such great riches was desolated. And every ship-pilot, and all the company on the ships, and sailors, and as many as work the sea, stood afar off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.18'>And they cried out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What [is] like the great city?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.19'>And they threw dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe! Woe to the great city, by which all who had ships in the sea were rich out of her costliness! For in one hour she was ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.20'>Rejoice over her, Heaven, and the holy apostles, and the prophets, since God judged your judgment on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.21'>And one strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw [it] into the sea, saying, So on an impulse the great city, Babylon, will be thrown down and not at all will be found any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.22'>And the voice of harpers, and of musicians. and flutists, and of trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you. And every craftsman of any craft will not be found any more in you. And the sound of a mill will never more be heard at all in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.23'>And the light of a lamp will never more shine at all in you. And the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will never more be heard at all in you. For your merchants were the great ones of the earth; for by your sorceries all nations were deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.24'>And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all those who were slain on the earth.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.19'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.1'>And after these things I heard a great sound of a numerous crowd in Heaven, saying, Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and honor and the power to the Lord our God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.2'>For true and righteous [are] His judgments. For He has judged the great harlot who defiled the earth with her fornication, and He has avenged the blood of His servants out of her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.3'>And secondly they said, Hallelujah! And her smoke rose up forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.4'>And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God sitting on the throne, saying, Amen! Hallelujah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.5'>And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all His servants, and the ones fearing Him, the small and great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.6'>And I heard as the sound of a great multitude, and as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of strong thunders, saying, Hallelujah! For the Lord God omnipotent reigns!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.7'>Let us be glad and rejoice and we will give glory to Him. For the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has prepared herself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.8'>And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.9'>And he said to me, Write, Blessed [are] those who have been called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.10'>And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See, do not do it! I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.11'>And I saw Heaven opened. And behold, a white horse! And He sitting on him [was] called Faithful and True. And in righteousness He judges and makes war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.12'>And His eyes [were] like a flame of fire, and on His head many crowns. And He had a name written, one that no one knew except Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.13'>And He had been clothed [in] a garment dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.14'>And the armies in Heaven followed Him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.15'>And out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, so that with it He should strike the nations. And He will shepherd them with a rod of iron. And He treads the winepress of the wine of the anger and of the wrath of Almighty God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.16'>And He has on [His] garment, and on His thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.17'>And I saw one angel standing in the sun. And he cried with a great voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come and gather together to the supper of the great God,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.19.19'>And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth and their armies, being gathered to make war against Him who sat on the horse, and against His army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.20'>And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet doing signs before it, (by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast), and those who had worshiped his image.

      <chapter osisID='Rev.22'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.1'>And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.2'>In the midst of its street, and of the river, from here and from there, [was] the Tree of Life, which bore twelve fruits, each yielding its fruit according to one month. And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.3'>And every curse will no longer be; but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His servants will serve Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.4'>And they will see His face, and His name [will be] in their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.5'>And there will be no night there. And they need no lamp, or light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light. And they will reign forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.6'>And he said to me, These sayings [are] faithful and true. And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel to show to His servants the things which must shortly be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.7'>Behold, I come quickly. Blessed [is] he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this Book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.8'>And I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel showing me these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.9'>Then he said to me, Behold! See, do not do it! For I am your fellow-servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this Book. Do worship to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.10'>And he said to me, Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this Book; for the time is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.11'>He acting unjustly, let him still act unjustly. And the filthy, let him be filthy still. And the righteous, let him be righteous still. And the holy, let him be holy still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.12'>And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward [is] with Me, to give to each according as his work is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.13'>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, the First and the Last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.14'>Blessed [are] they who do His commandments, that their authority will be over the Tree of Life, and they may enter in by the gates into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.15'>But outside [are] the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and makes a lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.16'>I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify these things to you over the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright and Morning Star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.17'>And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let the [one] hearing say, Come! And let the one] who is thirsty come. And he willing, let him take of the water of life freely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.18'>For I testify together [to] everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this Book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add on him the plagues that have been written in this Book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.19'>And if anyone takes away from the words of the Book of this prophecy, God will take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the holy city, and [from] the things which have been written in this Book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.20'>He who testifies these things says, Yes, I am coming quickly, Amen. Yes, come, Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.21'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with all of you. Amen.</verse>
