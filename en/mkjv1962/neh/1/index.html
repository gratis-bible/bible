And it happened in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and men of Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said to me, The remnant left of the captivity there in the province [is] in great affliction and shame. And the wall of Jerusalem [is] broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it happened when I heard these words, I sat down and wept. And I mourned [for] days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I said, I pray You, O LORD God of Heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and mercy for those who love Him and keep His commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>let Your ear now be open, and Your eyes open, so that You may hear the prayer of Your servant, which I pray before You now, day and night, for the sons of Israel Your servants, and confessing the sins of the sons of Israel which we have sinned against You. Both I and my father's house have sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>We have acted very wickedly against You, and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments which You commanded Your servant Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I pray You, remember the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, [If] you sin, I will scatter you among the nations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but [if] you turn to Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though you were cast out to the outermost part of the heavens, [yet] I will gather you from there and will bring you to the place that I have chosen to set My name there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And these [are] Your servants and Your people whom You have redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>O LORD, I pray You, let now Your ear be open to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who desire to fear Your name. And I pray You, bless Your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. (For I was the king's cupbearer.)</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
