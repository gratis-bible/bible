      <chapter osisID='Eph.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.2'>Grace [be] to you, and peace from God our Father and [from the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.3'>Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.4'>according as He chose us in Him before [the] foundation of [the] world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.5'>having predestined us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.6'>to [the] praise of [the] glory of His grace, in which He has made us accepted in the [One] having been loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.7'>In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.8'>which He caused to abound toward us in all wisdom and understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.9'>having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.10'>for an administration of the fullness of times, to head up all things in Christ, both the things in Heaven, and the things on earth, [even] in Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.11'>in whom also we have been chosen to an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His own will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.12'>for us to be to [the] praise of His glory, who previously had trusted in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.13'>in whom also you, hearing the word of truth, the gospel of our salvation, in whom also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.14'>who is the earnest of our inheritance, to [the] redemption of the purchased possession, to [the] praise of His glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.15'>Therefore I also, hearing of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love to all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.16'>do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.17'>that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in [the] knowledge of Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.18'>the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what is the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.19'>and what [is] the surpassing greatness of His power toward us, the ones believing according to the working of His mighty strength</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.20'>which He worked [in] Christ in raising Him from [the] dead, and He seated [Him] at His right hand in the heavenlies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.21'>far above all principality and authority and power and dominion, and every name being named, not only in this world, but also in the coming age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.22'>And He has put all [things] under His feet and gave Him [to be] Head over all [things] to the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.23'>which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.1'>And He [has made you alive], who were once dead in trespasses and sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.2'>in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.3'>among whom we also had our way of life in times past, in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.4'>But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love [with] which He loved us</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.5'>(even when we were dead in sins) has made us alive together with Christ (by grace you are saved),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.6'>and has raised [us] up together and made [us] sit together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.7'>so that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in [His] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.8'>For by grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, [it is] the gift of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.9'>not of works, lest anyone should boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.10'>For we are [His] workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.11'>Therefore remember that you, the nations, in time past [were] in [the] flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'>and that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.13'>But now in Christ Jesus you who were once afar off are made near by the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'>For He is our peace, He making us both one, and [He] has broken down the middle wall of partition [between us] ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'>having abolished in His flesh the enmity (the Law of commandments [contained] in ordinances) so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, making peace [between them] ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'>and so that He might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity in Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'>And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off, and to those who were near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'>For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'>Now therefore you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.20'>and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being [the] chief cornerstone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.21'>in whom every building having been fitly framed together, grows into a holy sanctuary in the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.22'>in whom you also are built together for a dwelling place of God through [the] Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.1'>For this cause, I, Paul, am the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.2'>if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given to me toward you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.3'>that by revelation He made known to me the mystery (as I wrote before in few words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.4'>by which, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.5'>which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.6'>that the nations should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partaker of His promise in Christ through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.7'>Of this [gospel] I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of His power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.8'>This grace is given to me ( who am] less than the least of all saints) to preach the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ among the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.9'>and to bring to light what [is] the fellowship of the mystery which from eternity has been hidden in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'>so that now to the rulers and powers in the heavenlies might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.11'>according to the eternal purpose which He purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.12'>in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through His faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.13'>For this reason I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'>For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.15'>of whom the whole family in Heaven and earth is named,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.16'>that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.17'>that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.18'>may be able to comprehend with all saints what [is] the breadth and length and depth and height,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.19'>and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.20'>Now to Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.21'>to Him [be] glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, forever. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>I therefore, the prisoner in [the] Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the calling with which you are called,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'>with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'>endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.4'>[There is] one body and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'>one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'>one God and Father of all, who [is] above all and through all and in you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'>But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'>Therefore He says, When He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive and gave gifts to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'>(Now that He ascended, what is it but that He also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'>He who descended is the same also as He who ascended up far above all heavens, that He might fill all things.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'>And truly He gave some [to be] apostles, and some [to be] prophets, and some [to be] evangelists, and some [to be] pastors and teachers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'>for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'>And this until we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man, to [the] measure of [the] stature of the fullness of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>so that we no longer may be infants, tossed to and fro and carried about by every wind of doctrine, in the dishonesty of men, in cunning craftiness, to the wiles of deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>But that you, speaking the truth in love, may in all things grow up to Him who is the Head, [even] Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'>from whom the whole body, fitted together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to [the] effectual working in the measure of each part, producing the growth of the body to the edifying of itself in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>This I say therefore, and testify in [the] Lord, that you should not walk from now on as other nations walk, in [the] vanity of their mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>having the understanding darkened, being alienated [from] the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>For they, being past feeling, have given themselves up to lust, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>But you have not so learned Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>if indeed you have heard Him and were taught by Him, as [the] truth is in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'>For you ought to put off the old man (according to your way of living before) who is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'>and be renewed in the spirit of your mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>And you should put on the new man, who according to God [was] created in righteousness and true holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>Therefore putting away lying, let each man speak truth with his neighbor, for we are members of one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>Be angry, and do not sin. Do not let the sun go down upon your wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'>neither give place to the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>Let him who stole steal no more, but rather let him labor, working with [his] hands the thing which [is] good, so that he may have [something] to give to him who needs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>Let not any filthy word go out of your mouth, but if any [is] good to building up [in respect of] need, that it may give grace to the ones hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you are sealed until [the] day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and tumult and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'>And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>Therefore be followers of God, as dear children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given Himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>For let fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness not be once named among you, as becomes saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>neither baseness, foolish talking, jesting, which are not becoming, but rather giving of thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>For you know this, that no fornicator, or unclean person, or covetous [one] (who is an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>Let no man deceive you with vain words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the children of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>Therefore do not be partakers with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>For you were once darkness, but now [you are] light in [the] Lord; walk as children of light</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>(for the fruit of the Spirit [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>proving what is acceptable to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest [is] light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>Therefore he says, Awake, sleeping ones! And arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord [is].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>And do not be drunk with wine, in which is excess, but be filled with the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>always giving thanks for all things to God [the] Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>Wives, submit yourselves to [your] own husbands, as to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ [is] the head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so [let] the wives [be] to their own husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>that He might present it to Himself [as] the glorious church, without spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that it should be holy and without blemish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>So men ought to love their wives as their [own] bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>For no man ever yet hated his [own] flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord loves the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>For we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two of them shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>But also let everyone of you in particular so love his wife even as himself, and the wife that she defers to her husband.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.1'>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.2'>Honor your father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.3'>so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.4'>And fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.5'>Slaves, obey [your] masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.6'>not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from [the] heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.7'>with good will doing service as to the Lord and not to men</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.8'>(knowing that whatever good thing he does, he shall receive the same from the Lord, whether [he is] a slave or a freeman).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.9'>And masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening, knowing that your Master also is in Heaven. There is no respect of persons with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.10'>Finally, my brothers, be strong in [the] Lord and in the power of His might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.11'>Put on the whole armor of God so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.12'>For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the world's rulers, of the darkness of this age, against spiritual wickedness in high [places].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.13'>Therefore take to yourselves the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.14'>Therefore stand, having your loins girded about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.15'>and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.16'>Above all, take the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</verse>
