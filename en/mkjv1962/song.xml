        <verse osisID='Song.1.6'>Do not look on me, that I [am] black, that the sun has looked on me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; [but] my vineyard I have not kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.7'>Tell me, [You] whom my soul loves, where do You feed, where do You lie down at noon? For why should I be as one who is veiled beside the flocks of Your companions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.8'>If you know not, most beautiful among women, go in the footsteps of the flock; and feed your kids beside the shepherds' tents.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.9'>My Beloved is like a roe or a young hart. Behold, [He] stands behind our wall, He looks forth at the windows, peering from the lattice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.10'>My Beloved spoke, and said to me, Rise up, My love, My beautiful one, and come away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.11'>For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over; it goes to itself.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.14'>O My dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let Me see your face, let Me hear your voice; for your voice [is] sweet, and your face [is] beautiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.15'>Take us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vines; for our vines [have] tender grapes.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Song.3'>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.1'>By night on my bed I sought Him whom my soul loved; I sought [Him], but I did not find Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.2'>I will rise now and go about the city, in the streets and in the broad ways; I will seek [Him] whom my soul loves. I sought Him, but I did not find Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.3'>The watchmen going about the city found me. [I said], Have you seen Him whom my soul loves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.4'>But a little while after I passed from them, I found [Him] whom my soul loves. I held Him and would not let Him go, until I had brought Him into my mother's house, and into the room of her who conceived me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.5'>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles, and by the does of the field, do not stir up nor awake [my] love until it pleases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.6'>Who [is] this coming up out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, from all the merchant's powders?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.7'>Behold his bed, Solomon's! Sixty mighty men [are] around it, of Israel's mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.8'>They all hold swords, instructed in war; each man has his sword on his thigh because of fear in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.9'>King Solomon made himself a litter-bed of Lebanon's trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.10'>He made its poles [of] silver, its back gold, its seat of purple, its middle was paved [with] love by the daughters of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.11'>Go forth, O daughters of Zion, and behold King Solomon with the crown [with] which his mother crowned him on his wedding day, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.4'>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.1'>Behold, you [are] beautiful, My love. Behold, you [are] beautiful; your eyes [are] like doves' from behind your veil; your hair [is] like a flock of goats that appear from Mount Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.2'>Your teeth [are] like a flock of shorn [sheep], which came up from the washing; they all are bearing twins and not one [is] barren among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.3'>Your lips [are] like a cord of scarlet, and your speech [is] becoming; your temples [are] like a piece of pomegranate behind your veil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.4'>Your neck [is] like the tower of David built for an armory, on which there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.5'>Your two breasts [are] like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, feeding among the lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.6'>Until when the day blows, and the shadows flee away, I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.7'>You [are] all fair, My love; no blemish [is] in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.8'>Come with Me from Lebanon, [My] spouse; with Me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.9'>You have ravished My heart, My sister, [My] spouse; you have ravished My heart with one of your eyes, with one chain of your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.10'>How fair is your love, My sister, [My] spouse! How [much] better [is] your love than wine, and the smell of your ointments than all spices!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.11'>Your lips, [My] spouse, drop like the honeycomb; honey and milk [are] under your tongue; and the smell of your garments [is] like the smell of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.12'>A locked garden [is] My sister, [My] spouse; a rock heap locked up, a fountain sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.13'>Your plants [are] an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; with henna [and] spikenard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.14'>spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.15'>a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.16'>Awake, O north [wind]; and come, south [wind]; blow on my garden, so [that] the spices of it may flow out. Let my Beloved come into His garden and eat His pleasant fruits.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.5'>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.1'>I have come into My garden, My sister, [My] spouse; I have gathered My myrrh with My spice; I have eaten My honeycomb with My honey; I have drunk My wine with My milk. Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O Beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.2'>I sleep, but my heart is awake. [It is] the sound of my Beloved that knocks, [saying], Open to Me, My sister, My love, My dove, My undefiled; for My head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.3'>I have put off My coat; How shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.5.5'>I rose up to open to my Beloved; and my hands dripped [with] myrrh, and my fingers flowing [with] myrrh on the handles of the bolt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.6'>I opened to my Beloved, but my Beloved had left. He passed on. My soul went out when He spoke; I sought Him, but I could not find Him. I called Him, but He did not answer me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.7'>The watchmen who went about the city found me [and] struck me; they wounded me. The keepers of the wall lifted my veil from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.8'>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my Beloved, what do you tell Him? That I [am] sick [with] love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.9'>What [is] your Beloved more than [another] beloved, most beautiful among women? What [is] your Beloved more than [another] beloved, that you adjure us so?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.5.11'>His head [is like] refined gold; His locks [are] bushy, black as a raven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.12'>His eyes [are] as doves' [eyes] on the rivers of waters, washed with milk, sitting on a setting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.13'>His cheeks [are] like a bed of spices, a raised bed of aromatic herbs. His lips [are as] lilies dropping flowing myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.14'>His hands [are like] rings of gold filled with jewels; His body an ivory plate overlaid with sapphires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.15'>His legs [are like] pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold; His face [is like] Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.16'>His mouth [is] most sweet; yes, He [is] altogether lovely. This [is] my Beloved, and this [is] my Friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.6'>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.1'>Where has your Beloved gone, most beautiful among women? Where has your Beloved turned? For we seek Him along with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.2'>My Beloved has gone down to His garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens and to gather lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.3'>I [am] my Beloved's, and my Beloved [is] mine; He feeds among the lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.4'>O my love, you [are] as beautiful as Tirzah, as lovely as Jerusalem, as inspiring as an army with banners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.5'>Turn away your eyes from Me, for they have overcome Me; your hair [is] like a flock of goats that appears from Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.6'>Your teeth [are] like a flock of ewes which go up from the washing; they all [are] bearing twins, and a barren one [is] not among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.7'>Your temples behind your veil [are] like a piece of pomegranate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.8'>There [are] sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and virgins without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.9'>But My dove, My undefiled is one [alone]. She [is] the [only] one of her mother. She [is] the choice of her who bore her. The daughters saw [her] and blessed her; the queens and the concubines saw her, and they praised her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.10'>Who [is] she who looks forth like the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, awesome [armies] with banners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.11'>I went down into the garden of nuts to see the greenery of the valley, to see whether the vine flowered [and] the pomegranates budded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.12'>I did not know, [but] my soul set me [on] the chariots of my princely people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.13'>Return, return, O Shulamite! Return, return, that we may look on you. What will you see in the Shulamite? As it were the dance of two camps.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.7'>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.1'>How beautiful [are] your feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! The curves of your thighs [are] like jewels, the work of the hands of a skillful workman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.2'>Your navel [is like] a round goblet, which never lacks mixed wine; your belly [is like] a heap of wheat set about with lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.3'>Your two breasts [are] like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.4'>Your neck [is like] a tower of ivory; your eyes [like] the fish-pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Beth-rabbim; your nose [is like] the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.5'>Your head on you [is like] Carmel, and the hair of your head like purple cloth; the King [is] held captive in its tresses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.6'>How beautiful and how pleasant you [are], O love, for delights!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.7'>Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts [are] like clusters [of grapes].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.8'>I said, I will go up in the palm tree, I will take hold of its stalk. And please let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the smell of your nose like apples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.9'>and the roof of your mouth like the best wine for my Beloved, that goes [down] smoothly for My Beloved, flowing softly [over] the lips of sleeping ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.10'>I [am] my Beloved's, and His desire [is] toward me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.11'>Come, my Beloved, let us go out into the field; let us stay in the villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.12'>Let us rise up early to the vineyards; let us see [if] the vine flowers, whether the tender grape appears, and the pomegranates bud forth; there I will give You my loves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.13'>The love-apples give a scent, and over our doors [are] all pleasant [fruits], new and old, which I have laid up for You, O my Beloved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.8'>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.1'>Who could give You to me [as] my brother, who sucked my mother's breasts? [When] I find You outside, I would kiss You; yea, they would not despise me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.2'>I would lead You, [and] bring You into my mother's house. You would instruct me; I would cause You to drink spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.3'>His left hand [would be] under my head, and His right embrace me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.4'>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, why should you stir up or awaken [my] Love until it pleases?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.5'>Who [is] this coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her Beloved? I awakened you under the apple tree; there your mother travailed with you; there she travailed and bore you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.6'>Set me as a seal on Your heart, as a seal on Your arm; for love [is] strong as death. Jealousy [is] cruel as the grave; its flames [are] flames of fire, a flame of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.7'>Many waters cannot quench love, nor will the rivers overflow it. If [a] man would give all the wealth of his house for love, it would be scorned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.8'>We have a little sister, and she has no breasts; what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.9'>If she [is] a wall, we will build on her a palace of silver; and if she [is] a door, we will enclose her [with] boards of cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.10'>I [was] a wall, and my breasts like towers; then I was in His eyes as one finding peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.11'>Solomon had a vineyard in Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; everyone for its fruit was to bring a thousand of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.12'>My vineyard, which [is] mine, [is] before me; you, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and for the keepers of its fruit, two hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.13'>You who dwell in the gardens, the companions listen to your voice; cause me to hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.14'>Hurry, my Beloved, and be like a gazelle, or a young deer, the stag, on the mountains of spices.</verse>
