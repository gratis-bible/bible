      <chapter osisID='Judg.1'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.1'>And it happened after the death of Joshua, the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites to fight against them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.2'>And the LORD said, Judah shall go up. Behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.3'>And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot so that we may fight against the Canaanites. And I likewise will go with you into your lot. So Simeon went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.4'>And Judah went up. And the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand. And they killed ten thousand men of them in Bezek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.5'>And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek. And, they fought against him, and they killed the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.6'>And Adoni-bezek fled. And they ran after him and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.7'>And Adoni-bezek said, Seventy kings [with] their thumbs and big toes cut off have gathered under my table. As I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.8'>And the sons of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and had struck it with the edge of the sword, and had set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.9'>And afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.10'>And Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron; (and the name of Hebron before [was] Kirjath-arba). And they killed Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.11'>And from there he went against those who lived in Debir. And the name of Debir before [was] Kirjath-sepher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.12'>And Caleb said, He who strikes Kirjath-sepher and takes it, I will give Achsah my daughter to him for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.13'>And Othniel, the son of Caleb's younger brother Kenaz, took it. And he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.14'>And it happened when she came, she moved him to ask for a field from her father. And she dismounted from the ass. And Caleb said to her, What do you desire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.15'>And she said to him, Give me a blessing. For you have given me a south land. Give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.16'>And the sons of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the sons of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which [is] in the south of Arad. And they went and lived among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.17'>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they killed the Canaanites who lived in Zephath and destroyed it. And the name of the city [was called] Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.18'>Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and Askelon with its border, and Ekron with its border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.19'>And the LORD was with Judah. And he took possession of the mountain. But he could not drive out those who lived in the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.20'>And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses said. And he expelled the three sons of Anak from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.21'>And the sons of Benjamin did not expel the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem. But the Jebusites live with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.22'>And the house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the LORD [was] with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.23'>And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. And the name of the city before [was] Luz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.24'>And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said to him, Please show us the gate into the city, and we will show you mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.25'>And when he showed them the gate into the city, they struck the city with the edge of the sword. But they let the man and all his family go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.26'>And the man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city, and called the name of it Luz, which [is] the name of it to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.27'>And Manasseh had not taken possession of Beth-shean and its daughter- villages], nor Taanach and its daughter- villages], nor [struck] the inhabitants of Dor and its daughter- villages], nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its daughter- villages], nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its daughter- villages]. For the Canaanites were determined to live in that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.28'>And it happened, when Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not completely expel them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.29'>And Ephraim did not expel the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.30'>And Zebulun did not expel those who lived in Kitron, nor those who lived in Nahalol. But the Canaanites lived among them and became tributaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.31'>And Asher did not expel those who lived in Accho, and the inhabitants of Sidon, and Ahlab, and Achzib, and Helbah, and Aphik, and Rehob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.32'>But the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, those who lived in the land, for they did not expel them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.33'>And Naphtali did not expel those who lived in Beth-shemesh, and the inhabitants of Beth-anath, and they lived among the Canaanites, those who lived in the land. But those who lived in Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath became tributaries to them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.34'>And the Amorites forced the sons of Dan into the mountain. For they would not allow them to come down to the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.35'>But the Amorites desired to stay in Mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim. Yet the hand of the house of Joseph was heavy so that they became tributaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.36'>And the border of the Amorites [was] from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock and upward.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.2'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.1'>And the Angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you go up out of Egypt, and have brought you into the land which I swore to your fathers. And I said, I will never break My covenant with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.2'>And you shall make no treaty with those who live in this land. You shall throw down their altars. But you have not obeyed My voice. What [is] this that you have done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.3'>And I also said, I will not drive them out from before you, but they shall be thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.4'>And it happened when the Angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.5'>And they called the name of that place The Place of Weeping. And they sacrificed there to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.6'>And when Joshua had let the people go, the sons of Israel left, each man to his inheritance, to possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.7'>And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD that He did for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.8'>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being a hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.9'>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.10'>And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them who did not know the LORD, nor even the works which He had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.11'>And the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.12'>And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt. And they followed other gods of the gods of the people who were around them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked the LORD to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.13'>And they forsook the LORD and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.14'>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and He delivered them into the hand of spoilers who spoiled them. And He sold them into the hand of their enemies all around, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.15'>Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them. And they were greatly distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.16'>But the LORD raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who spoiled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.17'>And yet they would not listen to their judges, but they went lusting after other gods, and bowed themselves to them. They turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, for they had obeyed the commandments of the LORD; these did not do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.18'>And when the LORD raised judges up for them, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For the LORD took pity because of their groanings before their oppressors and their crushers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.19'>And it happened when the judge was dead, they returned and made themselves more rotten than their fathers in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them. They did not cease from their own doings nor from their stubborn way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.20'>And the anger of the LORD glowed against Israel. And He said, Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not listened to My voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.21'>I also from now on will not expel any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.22'>so that by them I may test Israel, whether they are keeping the way of the LORD, to go in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.23'>And the LORD left those nations, without driving them out quickly. And He did not deliver them into the hand of Joshua.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.3'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.1'>And these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.2'>only that the generations of the sons of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least those who before knew nothing of it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.3'>five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that lived in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon to the border of Hamath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.4'>And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to the commands of the LORD, which He commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.5'>And the sons of Israel lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.6'>And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.7'>And the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baals and the Asherahs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.8'>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia. And the sons of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.9'>And when the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the sons of Israel, who delivered them, Othniel, the son of Caleb's younger brother Kenaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.10'>And the spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel and went out to war. And the LORD delivered Chushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, into his hand. And his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.11'>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.12'>And the sons of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD. And the LORD made Eglon the king of Moab strong against Israel because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.13'>And he gathered to him the sons of Ammon and Amalek. And he went forth and struck Israel, and took the city of palm trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.14'>So the sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.15'>But when the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a left-handed man. And the sons of Israel sent a present to Eglon the king of Moab by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.16'>But Ehud made himself a dagger which had two edges, a cubit long. And he tied it under his clothing upon his right thigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.17'>And he brought the present to Eglon king of Moab. And Eglon was a very fat man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.18'>And when he had finished offering the present, he sent away the people who carried the present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.19'>But he himself turned again from the graven images by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret message for you, O, king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.20'>And Ehud came to him. And he was sitting [in] the cool roof room which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God to you. And he rose out of his seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.21'>And Ehud put forth his left hand and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.22'>And the haft also went in after the blade. And the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly. And the dung came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.23'>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the room upon him, and locked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.24'>And when he had gone out, his servants came. And they looked, and, behold, the doors of the roof room were locked, they said, Surely he [is] covering his feet in his cool roof room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.25'>And they waited until they were ashamed. And, behold, he did not open the doors of the room. And they took a key and opened them. And behold, their lord [had] fallen down dead on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.26'>And Ehud escaped while they waited, and passed beyond the graven images, and escaped to Seirath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.27'>And it happened, when he had come, he blew a ram's horn in the mountain of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel went down with him from the mountain, and he before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.28'>And he said to them, Follow after me. For the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and did not allow a man to pass over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.29'>And they killed about ten thousand of the men of Moab at that time, all lusty, and all men of might. And there did not escape a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.30'>So Moab was subdued under the hand of Israel that day. And the land had rest eighty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.31'>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad. And he also delivered Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.4'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.1'>And the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD when Ehud was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.2'>And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who ruled in Hazor. The captain of his host was Sisera who lived in Harosheth of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.3'>And the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron. And he mightily oppressed the sons of Israel twenty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.4'>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, judged Israel at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.5'>And she lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim. And the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.6'>And she sent and called for Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.7'>And I will draw Sisera to you, the captain of Jabin's army, at the river Kishon, together with his chariots and his multitude. And I will deliver him into your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.8'>And Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go. But if you will not go with me, I will not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.9'>And she said, I will surely go with you. But the journey that you take shall not be for your honor, for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.10'>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh. And he went up with ten thousand men at his feet. And Deborah went up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.11'>And Heber the Kenite, of the sons of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent toward the plain of Zaanaim, near Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.12'>And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.13'>And Sisera gathered all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people with him, from Harosheth of the nations to the river of Kishon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.14'>And Deborah said to Barak, Up! For this [is] the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand. Has not the LORD gone out before you? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.15'>And the LORD struck Sisera, and all the chariots, and all the army, with the edge of the sword in front of Barak, so that Sisera got down from the chariot and fled on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.16'>But Barak pursued the chariots and after the army, to Harosheth of the nations. And all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. There was not a man left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.17'>And Sisera fled on his feet to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite. For [there was] peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.18'>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in my lord, turn in to me. Do not fear. When he had turned in to her into the tent, she covered him with a rug.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.19'>And he said to her, Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty. And she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink, and covered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.20'>Again he said to her, Stand [in] the door of the tent, and it shall be when any man comes asking of you, saying, Is there any man here? You shall say, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.21'>Then Jael, Heber's wife, took a peg of the tent and put a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the peg into his temple, and beat it into the ground. For he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.22'>And behold, as Barak followed Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said to him, Come and I will show you the man whom you seek. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the peg was in his temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.23'>And on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.24'>And the hand of the sons of Israel went on, and pressed hard against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.5'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.1'>Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.2'>Praise the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.3'>Hear, O, kings. Give ear, O, princes. I, [even] I, will sing to the LORD, I will sing to the LORD God of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.6.38'>And it was so. For he rose up early in the morning and gathered the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.39'>And Gideon said to God, Let not Your anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once. I pray You, let me test but this once with the fleece. Let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.7.1'>And Jerubbaal (he [is] Gideon) and all the people that were with him, rose up early and pitched beside the well of Harod, so that the army of the Midianites was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.2'>And the LORD said to Gideon, The people with you [are] too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel boast themselves against Me, saying, My own hand has saved me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.3'>Now, therefore, speak in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and go away early from Mount Gilead. And twenty-two thousand of the people returned. And there remained ten thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.4'>And the LORD said to Gideon, The people are still [too] many. Bring them down to the water, and I will separate them for you there.

        <verse osisID='Judg.7.5'>And he brought down the people to the water. And the LORD said to Gideon, Everyone who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set him apart; also everyone who bows down upon his knees to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.6'>And the number of them who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, [was] three hundred men. But all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.7'>And the LORD said to Gideon, I will save you by the three hundred men who lapped, and will deliver the Midianites into your hand. And let all the other people go, each man to his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.8'>And the people took provisions in their hand, and their ram's horns. And he sent away all the rest of Israel, each man to his tent, and kept those three hundred men. And the army of Midian was below him in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.9'>And it happened on that night, the LORD said to him, Arise, go down to the army, for I have delivered it into your hand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.7.11'>And you shall hear what they shall say. And afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down to the army. Then he went down with Phurah his servant to the edge of the ranks in the army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.12'>And the Midianites and the Amalekites, and all the sons of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude, and their camels without number, like the sand by the seaside for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.13'>And when Gideon had come, behold, a man told a dream to his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came to a tent, and struck it so that it fell, and overturned it, so that the tent lay along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.14'>And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else except the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. For into his hand God has delivered Midian and all the army.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.7.16'>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies. And he put a ram's horn in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and torches inside the pitchers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.17'>And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise. And, behold, when I come to the edge of the camp, it shall be, as I do, so you shall do.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.9.2'>I pray you, speak in the ears of all the men of Shechem: Which is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? Remember also that I [am] your bone and your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.3'>And his mother's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem with all these words. And their hearts were bent toward Abimelech, for they said, He is our brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.4'>And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless persons who followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.5'>And he went to his father's house at Ophrah and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy persons, upon one stone. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, was still left; for he hid himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.6'>And all the leaders of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo. And [they] came and made Abimelech king beside the plain of the pillar in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.7'>And when they told Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim. And he lifted up his voice and cried, and said to them, Listen to me, leaders of Shechem, so that God may listen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.8'>The trees went forth to anoint a king over them. And they said to the olive tree, Reign over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.9'>But the olive tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness with which they honor God and man by me, and go to be promoted over the trees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.10'>And the trees said to the fig tree, You come and reign over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.11'>But the fig tree said to them, Should I forsake my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.12'>Then the trees said to the vine, You come and reign over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.13'>And the vine said to them, Should I leave my wine, which cheers God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.14'>Then all the trees said to the bramble-bush, You come and reign over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.15'>And the bramble-bush said to the trees, If you truly anoint me king over you, come put your trust in my shadow. And if not, let fire come out of the bramble and burn up the cedars of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.16'>And now, if you have done truly and sincerely in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to what his hands did,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.17'>[in] which my father fought for you and much endangered his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.18'>And you have risen up against my father's house today, and have killed his sons, seventy persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his slave woman, king over the men of Shechem, because he [is] your brother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.19'>if then you have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house today, rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.20'>But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and burn up the men of Shechem and the house of Millo. And let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and burn up Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.21'>And Jotham ran away and fled, and went to Beer, and lived there for fear of Abimelech his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.22'>And Abimelech reigned three years over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.23'>And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem. And the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.24'>so that the cruelty to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and upon the men of Shechem who helped him in the killing of his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.25'>And the men of Shechem set men lying in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that passed by. And it was told to Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.26'>And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and went over to Shechem. And the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.27'>And [they] went out into the fields and gathered their vineyards and trod the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.28'>And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who [is] Abimelech, and who [is] Shechem, that we should serve him? Is [he] not the son of Jerubbaal, and Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.29'>And I wish this people were under my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase your army, and come out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.30'>And Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, and his anger was kindled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.31'>And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem. And behold, they fortify the city against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.32'>And now come up by night, you and the people with you, and lie in wait in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.33'>And it shall be in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, it shall be that you shall rise early and set upon the city. And behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you may do to them as you desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.34'>And Abimelech rose up by night, and all the people with him, and they lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.35'>And Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city. And Abimelech rose up, and the people with him, from lying in wait.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.36'>And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, people are coming down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, You are seeing the shadow of the mountains like men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.37'>And Gaal spoke again and said, See, people [are] coming by the middle of the land, and another company coming along by way of the Sorcerers' Oak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.38'>And Zebul said to him, Where is your mouth now, [with] which you said, Who [is] Abimelech, that we should serve him? Is not this the people whom you have despised? I pray you, go out now and fight with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.39'>And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.40'>And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, to the entrance of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.41'>And Abimelech lived at Arumah. And Zebul put Gaal and his brothers out, so that they should not live in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.42'>And it happened on the next day the people went out into the field. And they told Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.43'>And he took the people and divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field. And they looked, and behold, the people came forth out of the city. And he rose up against them, and struck them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.44'>And Abimelech and the company with him rushed forward and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city. And the two companies ran upon all the people in the field, and killed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.45'>And Abimelech fought against the city all that day. And he took the city and killed the people in it. And he beat down the city and sowed it [with] salt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.46'>And all the men of the tower of Shechem heard, and entered into a stronghold of the house of the god Berith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.47'>And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.48'>And Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people with him. And Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a limb from the trees, and took it and laid it on his shoulder, and said to the people who were with him, What you have seen me do, hurry and do likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.49'>And all the people also, each man, cut down a limb for themselves, and followed Abimelech, and set [them] at the stronghold, and set on fire the stronghold. And about a thousand men and women, all the men of the tower of Shechem, died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.50'>And Abimelech went to Thebez, and camped against Thebez, and took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.51'>But there was a strong tower in the middle of the city, and all the men and women, and all the leaders of the city, fled there, and shut [it] behind them, and got up to the top of the tower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.52'>And Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and went hard to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.53'>And a certain woman threw a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head and crushed his skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.54'>Then he called hastily to the young man who was his armor-bearer, and said to him, Draw your sword and kill me, so that men may not say of me, A woman killed him! And his young man thrust him through, and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.55'>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, each one of them left to go to his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.56'>And God repaid the evil of Abimelech, that which he did to his father in killing his seventy brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.57'>And all the evil of the men of Shechem God sent back upon their heads. And upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.10'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.1'>And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar. And he lived in Shamir in Mount Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.2'>And he judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.3'>And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty-two years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.4'>And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities which are called Havoth-jair to this day in the land of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.5'>And Jair died and was buried in Kamon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.6'>And the sons of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served the Baals and Ashtoreths, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the sons of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines. And they left the LORD, and did not serve Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.7'>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.8'>And that year they troubled and oppressed the sons of Israel; all the sons of Israel on the other side of Jordan, in the land of the Amorites, which [is] in Gilead, for eighteen years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.9'>And the sons of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was very distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.10'>And the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, saying, We have sinned against You, both because we have forsaken our God and also have served the Baals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.11'>And the LORD said to the sons of Israel, Did not [I deliver you] from Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the sons of Ammon, and from the Philistines?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.12'>And the Sidonians and the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you. And you cried to Me, and I delivered you out of their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.13'>Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods; therefore, I will deliver you no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.14'>Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen. Let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.15'>And the sons of Israel said to the LORD, We have sinned. Do You to us whatever [is] good in Your eyes; only deliver us, we pray You, today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.16'>And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD. And His soul was moved by the misery of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.17'>Then the sons of Ammon were gathered and camped in Gilead. And the sons of Israel assembled themselves together and camped in Mizpeh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.18'>And the people and rulers of Gilead said to one another, What man [is] there who will begin to fight against the sons of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.11'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.1'>Now Jephthah, the Gileadite, was a mighty man of war. And he [was] the son of a harlot. And Gilead fathered Jephthah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.2'>And Gilead's wife bore him sons. And his wife's sons grew up, and [they] threw Jephthah out and said to him, You shall not inherit in our father's house. For you [are] the son of another woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.3'>Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. And worthless men were gathered to Jephthah, and went out with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.4'>And it happened after some time the sons of Ammon made war against Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.5'>And when the sons of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah out of the land of Tob.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.11.8'>And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, For this reason we turn again to you now, so that you may go with us and fight against the sons of Ammon, and be our head over all the people of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.9'>And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If you bring me home again to fight against the sons of Ammon, and the LORD delivers them before me, shall I be your head?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.10'>And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, The LORD is witness between us if we do not do so according to your word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.11'>And Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them. And Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.12'>And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the sons of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you have come against me to fight in my land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.13'>And the king of the sons of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and to Jordan. Now therefore restore those lands peaceably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.14'>And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.15'>And he said to him, So says Jephthah, Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.16'>But when they came up from Egypt, Israel walked through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.17'>And Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, I pray you, let me pass through your land. But the king of Edom would not listen. And in the same way they sent to the king of Moab, but he would not. And Israel stayed in Kadesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.18'>And they went along through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but they did not come within the border of Moab; for Arnon was the border of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.19'>And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon. And Israel said to him, We pray you, let us pass through your land to my place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.20'>But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his border. But Sihon gathered all his people together and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.21'>And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them. So Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, who lived in that country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.22'>And they possessed all the borders of the Amorites, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.23'>So now the LORD God of Israel has put out the Amorites before His people Israel, and should you possess it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.24'>Will you not possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whomever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, we will possess them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.25'>And now [are] you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.26'>when Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities which [are] along by the borders of Arnon, for three hundred years? Why then did you not deliver them in that time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.27'>So I have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me. The LORD, the Judge, will judge this day between the sons of Israel and the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.28'>And the king of the sons of Ammon did not listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.29'>Then the Spirit of the LORD came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead passed over [to] the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.30'>And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If You will indeed give the sons of Ammon into my hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.31'>then it shall be that whatever comes out from the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon, surely it shall belong to the LORD, or I will offer it up [instead of] a burnt offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.32'>And Jephthah passed over to the sons of Ammon to fight against them. And the LORD delivered them into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.33'>And he struck them from Aroer even until you come to Minnith, twenty cities, and to the meadow of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. So were the sons of Ammon subdued before the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.34'>And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances. And she [was his] only child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.35'>And it happened when he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are one of those who trouble me. For I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot go back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.36'>And she said to him, My father, you have opened your mouth to the Lord; do to me according to that which has come out of your mouth, because the LORD has taken vengeance for you upon your enemies, even of the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.37'>And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me. Let me alone two months, so that I may go up and down upon the mountains and weep for my virginity, I and my companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.38'>And he said, Go. And he sent her away [for] two months. And she went with her companions and wept for her virginity upon the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.39'>And it happened at the end of two months she returned to her father, who did to her his vow which he had vowed. And she knew no man. And it is a custom in Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.40'>that the daughters of Israel went yearly to tell again of the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite, four days in a year.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.13.1'>And the sons of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD. And the LORD delivered them into the hands of the Philistines forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.2'>And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name [was] Manoah. And his wife was barren and did not bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.3'>And the Angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, Behold now, you [are] barren and do not bear. But you shall conceive and bear a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.4'>And now, please take heed, and do not drink wine nor strong drink, and do not eat any unclean [thing].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.5'>For lo, you shall conceive and bear a son. And no razor shall come upon his head. For the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb. And he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.6'>And the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and His face [was] like the face of an Angel of God, very terrifying. But I did not ask Him where He came from, neither did He tell me His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.7'>But He said to me, Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. And now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean [thing], for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.8'>And Manoah prayed to the LORD and said, O, my Lord, let the Man of God, whom You sent, come again to us and teach us what we shall do to the boy that shall be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.9'>And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the Angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field. But Manoah her husband [was] not with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.10'>And the woman hurried and ran, and told her husband, and said to him, Behold, the Man has appeared to Me, the one who came to me the [other] day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.11'>And Manoah arose and went after his wife, and came to the Man, and said to Him, [Are] You the Man who spoke to the woman? And He said, I [am].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.12'>And Manoah said, Now let Your words come to pass. [How] shall we order the child, and what shall we do to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.13'>And the Angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.14'>She may not eat of all that comes from the vine, neither let her drink wine nor strong drink, nor eat any unclean [thing]. Let her do all that I commanded her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.15'>And Manoah said to the Angel of the LORD, I pray You, let us keep You until we have made a kid ready for You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.16'>And the Angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Though you keep Me, I will not eat of your bread. And if you will offer a burnt offering, you must offer it to the LORD. For Manoah did not know that He [was] the Angel of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.17'>And Manoah said to the Angel of the LORD, What [is] Your name, so that when Your sayings come to pass we may do You honor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.18'>And the Angel of the LORD said to him, Why do you ask after My name in this way? Yea, it [is] Wonderful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.19'>And Manoah took a kid with a food offering, and offered [it] upon a rock to the LORD, and did wonderfully. And Manoah and his wife looked on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.20'>For it happened when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, the Angel of the LORD went up in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on [it] and fell on their faces to. the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.21'>But the Angel of the LORD did not appear any more to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that He [was] an Angel of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.22'>And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die because we have seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.23'>But his wife said to him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, He would not have received a burnt offering and a food offering at our hands, neither would He have showed us all these [things, nor have told us [such things] as these at this time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.24'>And the woman bore a son and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.25'>And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.14'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.1'>And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.2'>And he came up and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines. And now get her for me for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.3'>And his father and his mother said to him, [Is there] no woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her for me, for she pleases me very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.4'>But his father and his mother did not know that it [was] from the LORD, that He [was] looking for an occasion against the Philistines. For at that time the Philistines had the rule over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.5'>And Samson and his father and his mother went down to Timnath. And they came to the vineyards of Timnath. And, behold, a young lion roared to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.6'>And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he tore it as he would have torn a kid; and nothing was in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.7'>And he went down and talked with the woman. And she pleased Samson very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.8'>And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the dead body of the lion. And behold! A swarm of bees and honey [was] in the dead body of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.9'>And he took some of it in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother. And he gave to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the dead body of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.10'>And his father went down to the woman. And Samson made a feast there, for so the young men used to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.11'>And it happened when they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.12'>And Samson said to them, I will now put forth a riddle to you. If you certainly tell it to me [within] the seven days of the feast, and find [it] out, then I will give you thirty linen blouses and thirty changes of garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.13'>But if you cannot tell me, then you shall give me thirty linen blouses and thirty changes of garments. And they said to him, Put forth your riddle so that we may hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.14'>And he said to them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And in] three days they were not able to declare the riddle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.15'>And it happened on the seventh day they said to Samson's wife, Lure your husband so that he may tell the riddle to us, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you called us to take what we have? [Is it] not [so] ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.16'>And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, You only hate me, and do not love [me]. You have put forth a riddle to the sons of my people, and have not told [it] to me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not told my father nor to my mother, and shall I tell you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.17'>And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted. And on the seventh day, he told her, because she pressed hard upon him. And she told the riddle to the sons of her people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.18'>And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What [is] sweeter than honey, and what stronger than a lion? And he said to them, If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found [out my riddle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.19'>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave changes of garments to them who told what the riddle meant. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.20'>But Samson's wife was [given] to his companion, who had served as his friend.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.15'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.1'>And it happened afterward, in the days of wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a kid. And [he] said, I will go in to my wife into the room. But her father would not allow him to go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.2'>And her father said, I truly thought that you utterly hated her, and I gave her to your companion. [Is] not her younger sister fairer than she is? Please, let her be for you instead of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.3'>And Samson said concerning them, Now I shall be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do evil with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.4'>And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes and took fire brands, and turned tail to tail, and put a fire brand in the middle between two tails.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.5'>And [he] set the brands on fire, he let [them] go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both the shocks and also the standing grain, with the vineyards and olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.6'>And the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.7'>And Samson said to them, Though you have done this, yet I will be avenged of you, and after that I will stop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.8'>And he struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter. And he went down and lived in the top of the rock Etam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.9'>And the Philistines went up and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.10'>And the men of Judah said, Why have you come up against us? And they answered, We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.11'>Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Do you not know that the Philistines [are] rulers over us? What have you done to us? And he said to them, As they have done to me, so I have done to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.12'>And they said to him, We have come to bind you so that we may deliver you into the hands of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me that you will not fall upon me yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.13'>And they spoke to him, saying, No, but we will tie you up and deliver you into their hand. But surely we will not kill you. And they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.14'>He came to Lehi, and the Philistines shouted against him. And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords on his arms became as flax that has been burned with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.15'>And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand and took it, and killed a thousand men with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.16'>And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of an ass I have killed a thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.17'>And it happened when he had made an end of speaking, he threw away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Hill of the Jawbone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.18'>And he was very thirsty and called upon the LORD and said, You have given this great deliverance into the hand of Your servant. And now shall I die with thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.19'>But God cut open a hollow place and water came out there. And he drank, and his spirit came again, and he revived. Therefore, its name [is] called Fountain of the Praying One, which is in Lehi to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.20'>And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.16'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.1'>Then Samson went to Gaza. And he saw a harlot there, and went in to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.2'>The Gazites [were told], saying, Samson has come here. And they surrounded him and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, Until the light of the morning, then we shall kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.3'>And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took hold of the leaves of the gate of the city and the two posts, and picked them up, with the bar, and put [them] on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of a hill that [is] before Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.4'>And it happened afterwards, he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name [was] Delilah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.5'>And the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Lure him and see where his great strength [lies], and by what means we may prevail against him, so that we may tie him to afflict him. And each one of us will give you eleven hundred pieces [of] silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.6'>And Delilah said to Samson, Please tell me where your great strength [lies], and with what you may be bound to afflict you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.7'>And Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried, then I shall be weak and be as another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.8'>Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.9'>And the ambush [was] sitting for her in the inner room. And she said to him, The Philistines [are] upon you, Samson! And he broke the cords like a thread of tow when it smells fire. And his strength was not known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.10'>And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, you have mocked me and told me lies. Now, please, tell me with what you may be bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.11'>And he said to her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that have never been used, then I shall be weak and be as another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.12'>And Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them, and said to him, The Philistines [are] upon you, Samson! And the ambush [was] sitting for her in the inner room. And he broke them from off his arms like a thread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.13'>And Delilah said to Samson, You have mocked me until now, and told me lies. Tell me with what you may be bound. And he said to her, If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.14'>And she fastened [it] with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines are upon you, Samson! And He awakened out of his sleep, and pulled out the pin, the hand-loom and the web.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.15'>And she said to him, How can you say, I love you, and your heart [is] not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and have not told me in what your great strength [lies].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.16'>And it happened because she distressed him with her words daily, and urged him; and his soul was grieved to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.17'>And he told her all his heart, and said to her, A razor has not come on my hair, for I [am] a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb. If I am shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I will become weak and be like any man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.18'>And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come this once, for he has showed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought silver in their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.19'>And she made him sleep upon her knees. And she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head. And she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.20'>And she said, The Philistines [are] upon you, Samson! And he awoke out of his sleep and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he did not know that the LORD had departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.21'>And the Philistines took him and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass. And he ground in the prison house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.22'>However the hair of his head began to grow again after he had been shaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.23'>Then the lords of the Philistines gathered in order to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice. For they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.24'>And the people saw him and praised their god. For they said, Our god has delivered our enemy into our hand, and the destroyer of our country, who killed many of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.25'>And when their hearts were merry, it happened that they said, Call for Samson and he will make sport for us. And they called for Samson out of the prison house. And he made sport for them, and they set him between the pillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.26'>And Samson said to the lad who held him by the hand, Allow me to feel the pillars upon which the house stands, so that I may lean upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.27'>Now the house was full of men and women. And all the lords of the Philistines [were] there. And on the roof were about three thousand men and women who watched while Samson made sport.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.28'>And Samson called to the LORD and said, O, Lord GOD, remember me, I pray You, and strengthen me, I pray You, only this once, O God, so that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.29'>And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was held up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.30'>And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself mightily, and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death [were] more than those he killed in his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.31'>Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought [him] up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.17.3'>And when he had given back the eleven hundred of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly given the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image. And now I am giving it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.4'>And he gave the money back to his mother. And his mother took two hundred [shekels] of silver and gave them to a refiner, who made of it an engraved image and a molten image. And they were in the house of Micah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.5'>And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod and household gods, and anointed one of his sons, who became his priest.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.18'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.1'>In those days no king [was] in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites looked for an inheritance for them to live in. For to that day it had not fallen to them by inheritance among the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.2'>And the sons of Dan sent from their family five men from their borders, men of war, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to search it.
