      <chapter osisID='Jer.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.1'>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who [were] in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.2'>[to] whom the Word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.3'>It also came in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the exiling of Jerusalem in the fifth month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.4'>And it happened, the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.5'>Before I formed you in the belly I knew you; and before you came forth out of the womb I consecrated you, [and] I ordained you a prophet to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.6'>Then I said, Alas, Lord Jehovah! Behold, I do not know to speak; for I [am] a boy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.7'>But the LORD said to me, Do not say, I [am] a boy; for you shall go to all that I shall send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.8'>Do not be afraid of their faces; for I [am] with you to deliver you, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.9'>And the LORD put forth His hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have put My words in your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.10'>Behold! I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.11'>And the word of the LORD [came] to me, saying, Jeremiah, what do you see? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.12'>And the LORD said to me, You have seen well; for I will watch over My Word to perform it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.13'>And the Word of the LORD [came] to me the second time, saying, What do you see? And I said, I see a boiling pot; and its face [is] from the face of the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.14'>And the LORD said to me, Out of the north an evil will be set loose on all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.15'>For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says the LORD. And they shall come, and they shall each one set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its wall all around, and against all the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.16'>And I will pronounce My judgments against them regarding all their evil, [those] who have forsaken Me, and burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.17'>And you must gird up your loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be terrified at their faces, lest I prostrate you before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.18'>For, behold, I have made you a fortified city this day, and an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its rulers, against its priests, and against the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.19'>And they shall fight against you; but they shall not overcome you. For I [am] with you, says the LORD, to deliver you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.1'>And the Word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.2'>Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, So says the LORD, I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your betrothals, when you went after Me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.3'>Israel [was] holiness to the LORD, and the firstfruits of His increase. All that devour him shall offend; evil shall come on them, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.4'>Hear the Word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.5'>So says the LORD, What injustice have your fathers found in Me, that they have gone far from Me and have walked after vanity, and have become vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.6'>Nor did they say, Where [is] the LORD who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of dry places, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man lived?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.7'>And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat its fruit and its goodness; but when you entered, you defiled My land and made My inheritance an abomination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.8'>The priests did not say, Where [is] the LORD? And they who handle the law did not know Me; the shepherds also rebelled against Me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things not profitable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.9'>Therefore I will contend with you, says the LORD, and with your son's sons I will enter into judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.10'>For pass over the coasts of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and carefully consider, and see if there is [such a] thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.11'>Has a nation changed [their] gods who are yet no gods? But My people have changed their Glory for that which does not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.12'>Be amazed, O heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid; be completely desolated, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.13'>For My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me, the Fountain of living waters, to hew out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.14'>[Is] Israel a servant? Or [is] he a servant of the house? Why has he become a prey?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.15'>The young lions roared against him; they gave their voice. And they made his land a waste; his cities are burned without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.16'>Also the sons of Noph and Tahapanes have fed on the crown of your head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.17'>Have you not brought this on yourself, in that you have forsaken Jehovah your God, when He led you by the way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.18'>And now what is for you toward the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? Or what for you toward Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.19'>Your own evil shall correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you, therefore know and see that [it is] an evil and bitter [thing] that you have forsaken Jehovah your God, and that My fear [is] not in you, says the Lord Jehovah of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.20'>For long ago you broke your yoke [and] tore up your bonds; and you said, I will not transgress, when on every high hill and under every green tree you lay down [like] a harlot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.21'>Yet I planted you a noble vine, wholly a true seed. How then have you turned into the degenerate [shoots of] an alien vine to Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.22'>For though you wash yourself with potash, and multiply soap for yourself, [yet] your iniquity is marked before Me, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.23'>How can you say, I am not defiled; I have not gone after the Baals? See your way in the valley, know what you have done! [You are] a swift camel crossing its ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.24'>a wild ass used to the wilderness; in the desire of her passion she snuffs at the wind; [in] her time who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not tire themselves; in her month they will find her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.25'>Withhold your foot from [being] bare, and your throat from thirst. But you said, There is no hope; no; for I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.26'>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their rulers, and their priests, and their prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.27'>saying to a tree, You [are] my father; and to a stone, You gave [me] birth. For they have turned [their] back to Me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise and save us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.28'>But where [are] your gods that you have made for yourselves? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble; for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.29'>Why will you plead with Me? You all have sinned against Me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.30'>In vain I have stricken your sons; they received no correction. Your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.31'>O generation, see the Word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of darkness? Why do My people say, We roam [freely]; we will come no more to You?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.32'>Can a virgin forget her ornaments, [or] a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me days without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.33'>Why did you trim your way to seek love? Therefore you have also taught the evil women your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.34'>Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents; you did not find them breaking in, but on all these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.35'>Yet you say, Because I am innocent, surely His anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with you, because you say, I have not sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.36'>Why do you go about so much to change your way? You also shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.37'>Yes, you shall go out from this [place], and your hands on your head. For the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper by them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.1'>[They] say, If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him and will be for another man, will he return to her again? Would not that land be greatly defiled? But you play the harlot with many lovers; yet come back to Me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.2'>Lift up your eyes to the high places, and see. Where have you not been lain with? By the highways you have sat for them, like the Arabian in the wilderness; and you have defiled the land with your fornications and with your wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.3'>Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you had a harlot's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.4'>Will you not from this time cry to Me, My father, [You are] the guide of my youth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.5'>Will He keep [His anger] forever? Will He keep it to the end? Behold, you have spoken and done [all] the evil things you could do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.6'>The LORD also said to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and has fornicated there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.7'>And I said after she had done all these [things], Turn to Me! But she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.8'>And I saw, when for all the causes [for] which backsliding Israel committed adultery, I sent her away and gave a bill of divorce to her, yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she went and whored, she also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.9'>And it happened, from the folly of her whoredom, she defiled the land and fornicated with stones and stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.10'>And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not turned to Me with her whole heart, but with falsehood, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.11'>And the LORD said to me, The backsliding Israel has justified herself more than treacherous Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.12'>Go and cry these words toward the north, and say, Return, O backsliding Israel, says the LORD; [and] I will not cause My anger to fall on you; for I [am] merciful, says the LORD, [and] I will not keep anger forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.13'>Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have sinned against the LORD your God and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed My voice, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.14'>Turn, O backsliding sons, says the LORD; for I am married to you; and I will take you one from a city, and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.15'>And I will give you shepherds according to My heart, who shall feed you [with] knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.16'>And it will be when you have multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD! Nor shall it come to mind; nor shall they remember it; nor shall they visit [it]; nor shall it be made any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.17'>At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem. Nor shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.18'>In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance to your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.19'>But I said, How shall I put you among the sons, and give you a pleasant land, a beautiful inheritance [among] the hosts of nations? And I said, You shall call Me, My Father, and shall not turn away from Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.20'>Surely [as] a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so you have dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.21'>A voice was heard on the high places weeping, cryings of the sons of Israel; for they have perverted their way, [and] they have forgotten Jehovah their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.22'>Return, O backsliding sons, [and] I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come to You; for You are Jehovah our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.23'>Truly, for delusion [comes] from the high hills, tumult [on] the mountains. Truly, in Jehovah our God [is] the salvation of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.24'>For shame has eaten up the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.25'>We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covers us; for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.1'>If you will return, O Israel, says the LORD, return to Me. And if you will put away your abominations out of your sight, then you shall not be moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.2'>And you shall swear, The LORD lives, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in Him, and in Him they shall glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.3'>For so says the LORD to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and do not sow among thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.4'>Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, men of Judah and people of Jerusalem; lest My fury come forth like fire, and burn so that none can put [it] out; because of the evil of your doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.5'>Declare in Judah, and let it be heard in Jerusalem; and say, Blow the trumpet in the land; cry, gather together, and say, Gather yourselves and let us go into the fortified cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.6'>Set up the banner toward Zion; flee for safety and do not wait; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.7'>The lion has come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the nations has set out; he has left his place to make your land a waste. Your cities will fall into ruins without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.8'>Put on sackcloth for this, wail and howl; for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.9'>And it shall be at that day, says the LORD, the king's heart will perish, and the heart of the rulers; and the priests will be amazed, and the prophets will be astounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.10'>Then I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Surely You have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You shall have peace; but the sword reaches to the soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.11'>At that time it shall be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind [from] the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of My people, not to sift nor to cleanse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.12'>A wind more full than these shall come for Me. Now also I will utter judgments against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.13'>Behold, he shall come up like clouds, and his chariots like a tempest. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, for we are plundered!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.14'>O Jerusalem, cleanse your heart from evil so that you may be saved. How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.15'>For a voice declares from Dan, and proclaims affliction from mount Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.16'>Tell [it] to the nations: Behold! proclaim against Jerusalem! Besiegers are going to come from a distant land; and they will set their voice against the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.17'>Like watchmen of a field, they are against her all around; because she rebelled against Me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.18'>Your way and your doings have brought these [things] on you; this is your evil, because it is bitter, because it reaches to your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.19'>My bowels, my bowels! I convulse in pain. O walls of my heart! My heart is restless within me; I cannot be silent because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the ram's horn, the alarm of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.20'>Ruin on ruin is cried; for the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are laid waste, my curtains in a moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.21'>How long shall I see the banner [and] hear the sound of the ram's horn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.22'>For My people [are] foolish; they have not known Me; they are stupid sons, and they have no understanding. They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.23'>I looked on the earth, and, lo, [it was] without form and void; and the heavens, and they [had] no light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.24'>I looked on the mountains, and, lo, they quaked; and all the hills were shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.25'>I looked, and, lo, [there was] no man, and all the birds of the heavens had fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.26'>I looked, and, lo, the fruitful place [was] a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down before the face of the LORD, before His fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.27'>For so the LORD has said, The whole land shall be desolate, yet I will not make a full end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.28'>The earth shall mourn for this, and the heavens above shall be black, because I have spoken, I have purposed, and will not repent, nor will I turn back from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.29'>Every city shall flee from the sound of the horsemen and bowmen. They shall go into thickets and climb up among the rocks. All the city is abandoned, and not a man shall live in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.30'>And you, O desolate one, what will you do? Though you dress with crimson, though you put on ornaments of gold, though you make your eyes large with paint, you shall make yourself beautiful in vain; your lovers will despise you; they will seek your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.31'>For I have heard a voice as of a woman in labor, the anguish as one bearing her first child, the voice of Zion's daughter, gasping and spreading her hands, [saying], Woe to me now! For my soul faints because of murderers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.1'>Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in her open places, if you can find a man, if there is one who does justice, who seeks the truth; and I will pardon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.2'>And though they say, [As] the LORD lives; surely they swear falsely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.3'>O LORD, [are] not Your eyes on the truth? You have stricken them, but they have not grieved; You have destroyed them, but they have refused to receive correction; they have made their faces harder than rock; they have refused to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.4'>So I said, Surely these [are] poor; they are foolish; for they do not know the way of the LORD, [nor] the judgment of their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.5'>I will go up for myself to the great men, and will speak to them; for they have known the way of the LORD [and] the judgment of their God. But these have broken the yoke together and have torn off the bonds!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.6'>Therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them, [and] a wolf of the deserts shall rob them; a leopard shall watch over their cities. Everyone who goes out from them shall be torn in pieces, because their sins are many [and] their backslidings are multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.7'>Why shall I pardon you for this? Your sons have forsaken Me, and have sworn by No-gods. When I adjured them, then they committed adultery, and gathered themselves by troops in a harlot's house.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.10'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.1'>Hear the word which the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.2'>So says the LORD, Do not learn the way of the nations, and do not be terrified at the signs of the heavens; for the nations are terrified at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.3'>For the customs of the people [are] vain; for one cuts a tree out of the forest with the axe, the work of the hands of the workman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.4'>They adorn it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and hammers, so that it will not wobble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.5'>They [are] like a rounded post, and they cannot speak. They must surely be lifted, because they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them; for they cannot do evil nor good, for it is not in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.6'>[There is] none like You, O LORD; You [are] great, and Your name [is] great in might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.7'>Who would not fear You, O King of nations? For fear belongs to You, because among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, [there is] none like You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.8'>But they are all at once foolish and animal-like; the tree [is] an example of vanities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.9'>Silver beaten into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the goldsmith. Violet and purple [is] their clothing; they [are] all the work of skillful ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.10'>But the LORD [is] the true God, He [is] the living God, and the everlasting King. At His wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to stand His fury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.11'>So you shall say to them, The gods who have not made the heavens and the earth, they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.12'>He has made the earth by His power; He has established the world by His wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by His judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.13'>When He utters His voice, [there is] a noise of many waters in the heavens. He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; He makes lightnings with rain, and brings forth the wind out of His treasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.14'>Every man is stupid for [lack of] knowledge; every refiner is put to shame by the graven image; for his molten image is a lie, and no breath is in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.15'>They [are] vanity, the work of delusion; in the time of their judgment they shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.16'>The Portion of Jacob [is] not like them; for He [is] the Maker of all things; and Israel [is] the rod of His inheritance. Jehovah of hosts [is] His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.17'>Gather up your bundle from the ground, you who live under the siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.18'>For so says the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the people of the land at this time, and will distress them, so that they may find [Me].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.19'>Woe [to] me for my breaking! My wound is grievous; but I said, Truly this [is] a malady, and I must bear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.20'>My tabernacle is ravaged, and all my cords are broken; My sons went away from me, and they [are] not. [There is] none to stretch out My tabernacle any more, and to set up My curtains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.21'>For the pastors have become stupid, and have not sought the LORD, therefore they shall not be blessed, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.22'>Behold, the noise of the rumor has come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a den of jackals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.23'>O LORD, I know that the way of man does not [belong] to man; [it is] not in man who walks to direct his steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.24'>O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in Your anger, lest You bring me to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.25'>Pour out Your fury on the nations who do not know You, and on the families who do not call on Your name; for they have eaten up Jacob and have devoured him, and have destroyed him, and have made his dwelling desolate.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.11.1'>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.2'>Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the people of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.3'>And say to them, So says Jehovah, God of Israel, Cursed [is] the man who does not obey the words of this covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.4'>which I commanded your fathers in the day [that] I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey My voice and do them according to all that I command you; so you shall be My people, and I will be your God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.5'>so that I may fulfil the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as [it is] this day. Then I answered and said, Amen, O LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.6'>Then the LORD said to me, Declare all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.7'>For I earnestly testified to your fathers in the day I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and testifying, saying, Obey My voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.8'>Yet they did not obey nor bow down their ear, but walked each one in the stubbornness of his evil heart. So I will bring on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded [them] to do; but they did not do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.9'>And the LORD said to me, A plot is found among the men of Judah, and among the people of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.10'>They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear My words. And they went after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.11'>So the LORD says this: Behold, I will bring evil on them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry to Me, I will not listen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.12'>Then shall the cities of Judah and the people of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to whom they offer incense. But they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.13'>For [according to] the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah. And [according to] the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to [that] shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.14'>And you, do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them. For I will not hear [them] in the time they cry to Me for their trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.15'>What [is to] My beloved in My house, [since] she has committed her many evils? And has the holy flesh caused your evil to pass from you? [How] then do you exult?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.16'>The LORD called your name, a green olive tree, fair, [with] fine fruit. With the sound of a great storm He has set fire to it, and its branches are worthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.17'>And Jehovah of hosts who planted you has spoken evil against you, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done to themselves to provoke Me to anger by offering incense to Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.18'>And the LORD made me know, and I knew. Then You showed me their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.19'>But I [was] like a docile lamb being brought to the slaughter. And I did not know that they had plotted evils against me, [saying], Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, so that his name may be remembered no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.20'>But, O Jehovah of hosts who judges rightly, who tries the heart and the mind, let me see Your vengeance on them. For to You I have revealed my cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.21'>Therefore so says the LORD of the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, that you do not die by our hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.22'>So says Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.12'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.1'>Righteous [are] You, O LORD, that I might contend with You; yet let me speak with You about [Your] judgments. Why does the way of the wicked prosper? [Why] are all [those] happy who deal treacherously?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.2'>You have planted them; yea, they take root. They grow, yea, they make fruit. You [are] near in their mouth and far from their reins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.3'>But You, O LORD, know me. You have seen me and tried my heart toward You. Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and devote them for the day of slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.4'>How long shall the land mourn, and the grass of every field wither from the evil of those who dwell in it? The beasts and the birds have been destroyed, because they said, He shall not see our last end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.5'>If you have run with footmen, and they wore you out, then how can you compete with horses? And [if] you feel secure in the land of peace, then how will you do in the swelling of Jordan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.6'>For even your brothers and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you. Yea, they have called a multitude after you. Do not believe them, though they speak good things to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.7'>I have forsaken My house; I have left My inheritance. I have given the dearly beloved of My soul into the hand of her enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.8'>My inheritance is to Me as a lion in the forest; it cries out against Me; therefore I have hated it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.9'>My inheritance [is like] a speckled bird to Me; the birds all around [are] against her. Go, gather all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.10'>Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard; they have trampled My portion under foot; they have made My pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.11'>One has made it a desolation, it mourns to Me. The whole land is made desolate because no man lays [it] to heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.12'>The ravagers have come on all high places through the wilderness; for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the [one] end of the land even to the [other] end of the land. No flesh shall have peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.13'>They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns. They are worn out, [but] they do not profit. And they shall be ashamed of your harvests because of the fierce anger of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.14'>So says the LORD against all My evil neighbors who touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit: Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.15'>And it will be after I have plucked them out, I will return and have pity on them, and will bring them again, each man to his inheritance and each man to his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.16'>And it will be if they will carefully learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, [As] the LORD lives; as they taught the people to swear by Baal; then they shall be built in the midst of My people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.17'>But if they will not obey, I will uproot and destroy that nation, says the LORD.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.13'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.1'>So says the LORD to me, Go and buy for yourself a linen girdle, and put it on your loins, and do not put [it] in water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.2'>So I bought a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put [it] on my loins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.3'>And the word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.4'>Take the girdle that you bought, which [is] on your loins, and arise. Go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.5'>So I went and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.6'>And it happened at the end of many days the LORD said to me, Arise, go to Euphrates and take the girdle from there, which I commanded you to hide there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.7'>Then I went to Euphrates and dug, and took the girdle from the place where I had hidden it. And, behold, the girdle was rotted; it was not good for anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.8'>Then the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.9'>So says the LORD, In this way I will spoil the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.10'>This evil people, who refuse to hear My words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart and walk after other gods to serve them and to worship them, shall even be like this girdle, which is good for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.11'>For as the girdle holds fast to the loins of a man, so I have caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to Me, says the LORD; so that they might be to Me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory; but they would not hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.12'>So you will speak to them this word: So says Jehovah, God of Israel, Every skin shall be filled with wine. And they shall say to you, Do we not surely know that every skin shall be filled with wine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.13'>Then you shall say to them, So says the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the people of this land, even the kings that sit on David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.14'>And I will smash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, says the LORD. I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, [to keep them] from their destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.15'>Hear and give ear; do not be proud; for the LORD has spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.16'>Give glory to the LORD your God, before He causes darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and, while you look for light, He turns it into the shadow of death, setting up deep gloom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.17'>But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for [your] pride. And my eye shall weep sore and run down with tears, because the LORD's flock was captured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.18'>Say to the king and to the queen mother, Humble yourselves, sit down; for your greatness shall come down, even the crown of your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.19'>The cities of the south have been shut up, and none are opening; Judah has been exiled, all of it has been peacefully exiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.20'>Lift up your eyes and behold those who come from the north. Where [is] the flock [that] was given to you, your beautiful flock?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.21'>What will you say when he comes to punish you? For you have taught them [to be] rulers over you for a head. Do not pangs seize you, like a woman in travail?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.22'>And if you say in your heart, Why do these things come on me? [It is] because of the greatness of your iniquity; your skirts are bared, [and] your heels suffer violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.23'>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard its spots? [Then] you also may do good, who are accustomed to doing evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.26.18'>Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, So says Jehovah of hosts: Zion shall be plowed [like] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house like the high places of a forest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.19'>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah indeed put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD, and pray to the LORD, and the LORD repented of the evil which He had spoken against them? So we are doing great evil against our souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.20'>And there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.31.18'>I have surely heard Ephraim mourning to himself, [saying], You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bull not broken in; turn me, and I shall be turned. For You [are] the LORD my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.19'>Surely after I was turned, I repented; and after I was taught, I struck on [my] thigh. I was ashamed, yea, I even blushed, because I bore the disgrace of my youth.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.32'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.1'>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which [was] the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.2'>For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem. And Jeremiah the prophet was shut in the court of the guard, which [was] in the king of Judah's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.3'>For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy and say, So says the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.4'>and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.5'>and he shall lead Zedekiah into Babylon, and there he shall be until I visit him, says the LORD; though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.6'>And Jeremiah said, The Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.7'>Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you, saying, Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth; for the right to redeem it [is] yours, to buy [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.8'>So Hanameel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD and said to me, Please buy my field in Anathoth, which [is] in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance [is] yours, and the right to redeem [is] yours. Buy [it] for yourself. Then I knew that this [was] the word of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.9'>And I bought the field in Anathoth, of Hanameel my uncle's son, and weighed him the silver, seventeen shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.10'>And I wrote it in the document, and sealed [it], and called witnesses, and weighed the silver in the scales.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.11'>So I took the document of the purchase, that which was sealed [according] to the law and custom, and the open copy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.12'>And I gave the document of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, before the eyes of Hanameel my uncle's [son], and before the eyes of the witnesses who wrote in the purchase document, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.13'>And I commanded Baruch before them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.14'>So says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these books, the purchase document, the one sealed and the open book, and put them in an earthen vessel so that they may stand many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.15'>For so says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall be owned again in this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.16'>And after I gave the purchase document to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.17'>Ah, Lord Jehovah! You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and stretched out arm. Nothing is too great for You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.18'>You show loving-kindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them. The great, the mighty God, Jehovah of hosts, [is] His name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.19'>great in wisdom and mighty in work; for Your eyes [are] open on all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.20'>For You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, until this day, and in Israel, and among men; and have made You a name, as at this day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.21'>and have brought forth Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.22'>And You have given them this land, which You swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.23'>And they came in and possessed it, but they did not obey Your voice, nor did they walk in Your law. They have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have caused all this evil to come on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.24'>Behold, the siege mounds have come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the plague. And what You have spoken has happened; and, behold, You saw [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.25'>And You have said to me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.26'>Then the Word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.27'>Behold, I [am] the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.28'>Therefore so says the LORD: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.29'>And the Chaldeans who fight against this city shall come up and set this city on fire, and burn it with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke Me to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.30'>For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have only done evil before Me from their youth. For the sons of Israel have only provoked Me to anger with the work of their hands, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.31'>For this city has been to Me as a cause of My anger and of My fury from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before My face</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.32'>because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and of the sons of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger, they, their kings, their rulers, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.33'>And they have turned the back to Me, and not the face; though I taught them, rising up early and teaching [them], yet they have not listened to receive instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.34'>But they set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, to defile it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.35'>And they built the high places of Baal, in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I did not command them, nor did it come into My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.36'>And now therefore, so says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the plague:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.37'>Behold, I will gather them out of all the lands where I have driven them in My anger, and in My fury, and in great wrath. And I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.38'>And they shall be My people, and I will be their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.39'>And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me forever, for their good and for the good of their sons after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.40'>And I will cut an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good. But I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.41'>Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will truly plant them in this land with all My heart and all My whole soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.42'>For so says the LORD: As I have brought all this great evil on this people, so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.43'>And fields shall be bought in this land of which you say, [It is] a desert without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.44'>Men shall buy fields for silver, and write it in a book, and seal [it], and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south.

        <verse osisID='Jer.33.1'>And the Word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still shut up in the court of the guard, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.33.9'>And it shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise and an honor before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them. And they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the riches that I bring to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.10'>So says the LORD: Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say [is] a waste without man and without beast, [even] in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast;</verse>

For I will cause the captivity of the land to return, as at the first, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.12'>So says the LORD of hosts: Again in this place which is a desert without man and without beast, and in all its cities, there [shall be] a home of shepherds causing [their] flocks to lie down.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.34.2'>So says the LORD, the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, So says the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.3'>And you shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand. And your eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.34.5'>You shall die in peace; and as the burnings of spices [for] your fathers, the former kings which were before you, so they shall burn [spices] for you. And they will mourn you, saying, Ah, lord! For I have spoken the word, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.6'>Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.7'>when the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem and against all the remaining cities of Judah; against Lachish, and against Azekah; for these fortified cities remained of the cities of Judah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.34.11'>But afterward they turned and caused the slaves and slave women whom they had let go free, to return! And they subjected them for slaves and slave women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.12'>So the Word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.13'>So says the LORD, the God of Israel: I cut a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.14'>At the end of seven years each man should let go his brother, a Hebrew, and who has been sold to him. And when he has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you. But your fathers did not listen to me, nor bow down their ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.15'>And you had turned today, and had done right in My sight to call for liberty, each man to his neighbor. And you had cut a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.16'>But you turned and defiled My name, and each man caused his slave, and each man caused his slave woman, whom you had set free to do as they pleased, to return. And you brought them into service to be slaves and slave women to you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.35.8'>So we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he has commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.35.15'>I have also sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending, saying, Return now each man from his evil way, and make your doings good, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers. But you have not bowed down your ear, nor listened to Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.16'>Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have done the commandment of their father, which He commanded them; but this people has not listened to Me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.17'>therefore so says Jehovah, God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all the people of Jerusalem all the evil that I have spoken against them.

Repay her according to her work; according to all that she has done, do to her. For she has been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.30'>So her young men shall fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be silenced in that day, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.31'>Behold, I [am] against you, O proud ones, says the Lord Jehovah of hosts; for your day has come, the time that I will judge you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.32'>And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up. And I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall burn up everything all around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.33'>So says Jehovah of hosts: The sons of Israel and the sons of Judah [were] oppressed together. And all who captured them held them fast; they refused to let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.34'>Their Redeemer [is] strong; Jehovah of hosts, [is] His name. He shall thoroughly plead their cause, so that he may give rest to the land, and give trouble to the people of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.35'>A sword [is] on the Chaldeans, says the LORD, and on the people of Babylon, and on her rulers, and on her wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.36'>A sword [is] on the liars, and they shall become fools. A sword [is] on her mighty men, and they shall be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.37'>A sword [is] on their horses and their chariots, and on all the mixed people in her midst; and they shall become as women. A sword [is] to her treasuries, and they shall be robbed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.38'>A drought [is] on her waters; and they shall be dried up. For it [is] the land of idols, and they act madly [with] idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.39'>So the beasts of the desert shall dwell there with jackals. And the daughters of the ostrich shall dwell in her again. And it shall not again have anyone [in it] forever; it shall not be lived in until generation and generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.40'>As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors, says the LORD, no man shall live there; nor shall any son of man live in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.41'>Behold, a people shall come from the north, even a great nation; and many kings shall be stirred up from the farthest parts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.42'>They lay hold on a bow and spear; they [are] cruel and will not show mercy. Their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride on horses arrayed like a man for the battle against you, O daughter of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.43'>The king of Babylon has heard the report of them, and his hands became feeble. Anguish took hold of him, [and] pangs like [those of] a woman in labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.44'>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan to the home of the strong. But I will make them suddenly run away from her. And who [is] a chosen [one whom] I will appoint over her? For who [is] like Me? And who will set Me the time? And who [is] that shepherd who will stand before Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.45'>Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD that He has taken against Babylon; and His purposes which He has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans. Surely the least of the flock shall drag them; surely He shall make [their] dwelling a desert with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.50.46'>At the sound of the capture of Babylon the earth shall tremble, and a cry is heard among the nations.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.51'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.1'>So says the LORD: Behold, I will raise up a destroying wind against Babylon, and against those dwelling in the heart of My foes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.2'>And I will send aliens to Babylon who will sift her and will empty her land. For in the day of trouble they shall be against her all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.3'>Do not let the treader fully tread his bow; nor lift himself up in his armor. And do not spare her young men; utterly destroy all her army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.4'>So the dead shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, [those] thrust through in her streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.5'>For neither Israel nor Judah [has been] forsaken by his God, by Jehovah of hosts, though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.6'>Flee out of the middle of Babylon, and each man deliver his soul. Be not cut off in her iniquity, for this [is] the time of the LORD's vengeance; He will give to her a just reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.7'>Babylon [has been] a golden cup in the LORD's hand, which made all the earth drunk. The nations have drunk of her wine; therefore the nations rage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.8'>Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed. Wail for her; take balm for her pain, if perhaps she may be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.9'>We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed. Forsake her and let us go, each one into his own country; for her judgment reaches to the heavens and is lifted up to the skies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.10'>The LORD has brought forth our righteousness; come and let us declare in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.11'>Sharpen the arrows; gather the shields; the LORD has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes. For His plan [is] against Babylon, to destroy [it]; because it [is] the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of His temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.12'>Set up the banner on the walls of Babylon; make the watch strong; set up the watchmen; prepare the ambushes. For the LORD has both planned and done that which He spoke against the people of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.13'>O you who live on many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, [and] the measure of your unjust gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.14'>Jehovah of hosts has sworn by Himself, [saying], Surely I will fill you with men as with locusts; and they shall lift up a shout against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.15'>He has made the earth by His power; He has established the world by His wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by His understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.16'>When He utters [His] voice, [there is] a multitude of waters in the heavens; and He causes the mists to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings with rain and brings forth the wind out of His treasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.17'>Every man is brutish in knowledge; every refiner is put to shame by idols. For his molded image [is] a lie, and no breath [is] in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.18'>They [are] vanity, the work of errors; in the time of their judgment they shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.19'>The Portion of Jacob [is] not like them; for He [is] the Former of all things, and [Israel is] the rod of His inheritance. Jehovah of hosts [is] His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.20'>You [are] My war-club [and] weapons of war; for with you I will shatter nations; and with you I will destroy kingdoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.21'>And with you I will shatter the horse and his rider; and with you I will shatter the chariot and his rider.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.22'>Also with you I will shatter man and woman; and with you I will shatter old and young; and with you I will shatter the young man and the girl.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.24'>And I will give to Babylon, and to all the people of Chaldea, all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.25'>Behold, I [am] against you, O destroying mountain, says the LORD, who destroys all the earth. And I will stretch out My hand on you and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burned mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.26'>And they shall not take a stone from you for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but you shall be a waste forever, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.27'>Set up a banner in the land; blow a trumpet among the nations; prepare the nations against her. Call the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz together against her; set a commander against her. Cause the horses to come up as the rough locusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.28'>Consecrate nations against her, with the kings of the Medes, her governors and all her rulers, and all the land of his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.29'>And the land shall tremble and writhe. For every purpose of the LORD shall be done against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desert without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.30'>The mighty men of Babylon have stopped fighting; they have remained in strongholds; their might has failed. They became like women; they have burned her houses; her bars are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.31'>A runner shall run to meet a runner, and a herald to a herald, to announce to the king of Babylon that his city is captured from end [to end] ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.32'>and that the fords are stopped. And they have burned the reeds with fire, and the men of war are frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.33'>For so says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon [is] like a threshing floor; [it is] time to thresh her. Yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.34'>Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me; he has crushed me; he has made me an empty vessel. He has swallowed me up like a jackal; he has filled his belly with good things; he has thrown me out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.35'>the violence done to me and to my flesh [shall be] on Babylon; the dweller in Zion shall say. And, My blood [shall be] on the people of Chaldea, Jerusalem shall say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.36'>So the LORD says this: Behold, I will plead your cause and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.37'>And Babylon shall become heaps, a home for jackals, a horror and a hissing, without an inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.38'>They shall roar together like lions; they shall growl like lions' cubs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.39'>In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunk so that they may rejoice and sleep a never-ending sleep, and never awaken, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.40'>I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.41'>How Sheshach is captured! And how the praise of the whole earth is seized! How Babylon has become a horror among the nations!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.42'>The sea has come up over Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of its waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.43'>Her cities are a desert, a dry land and a wilderness, a land in which no man dwells, nor does [any] son of man pass by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.44'>And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up. And the nations shall not flow together any more to him; yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.45'>My people, go out of her midst; and let each man deliver his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.46'>And let not your heart faint, nor fear the rumor that shall be heard in the land. The report [shall come] in a year. And after that a report [shall come] in [another] year; and violence  shall be] in the land, ruler against ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.47'>So, behold, the days come that I will punish the idols of Babylon. And all her land shall be put to shame, and all her slain shall fall in her midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.48'>And the heavens and the earth, and all that [is] in them, shall shout for Babylon; for the plunderers shall come to her from the north, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.49'>As Babylon is to fall for the dead of Israel, so at Babylon the dead of all the earth shall fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.50'>You who have escaped the sword, go away; do not stand still. Remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.51'>We have turned pale because we have heard reproach; shame has covered our faces, for foreigners have come into the holy places of the LORD's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.52'>So, behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, that I will punish her idols, and through all her land the wounded shall groan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.53'>Though Babylon should mount up to the heavens, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, [yet] plunderers shall come to her from Me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.54'>A sound of a cry [comes] from Babylon, and great ruin from the land of the Chaldeans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.55'>because the LORD is stripping Babylon, and the great voice will perish out of her. And her waves will roar like great waters; the noise of their voice is given,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.56'>because the ravager has come on her, even on Babylon, and her mighty men are captured. Every one of their bows is broken, for Jehovah, God of vengeance, shall surely repay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.57'>And I will make her rulers drunk, also her wise ones, her governors, and her rulers, and her mighty men. And they shall sleep a never-ending sleep and not awaken, says the King whose name [is] Jehovah of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.58'>So says Jehovah of hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be completely broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labor in vain, and the people shall be in the fire, and they shall be weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.59'>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah [into] Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And Seraiah [was] a quiet prince.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.60'>So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon, all these words that are written against Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.61'>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you come to Babylon, and shall see and shall read all these words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.62'>then you shall say, O LORD, You have spoken against this place to cut it off, so that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be a ruin forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.63'>And it shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book, you shall tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.64'>And you shall say, In this way shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring on her. And they shall be weary. So far [are] the words of Jeremiah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.52'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.1'>Zedekiah [was] twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.2'>And he did evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.3'>For it was because of the anger of the LORD in Jerusalem and Judah (until He had cast them out from His presence) that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.4'>And it happened in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it and built forts against it all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.5'>So the city was under attack until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.6'>And in the fourth month, in the ninth of the month, the famine was very grievous in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.7'>And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which [was] by the king's garden. (And the Chaldeans lay around the city all around.) And they went by the way of the plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.8'>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And all his army was scattered from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.9'>And they took the king and carried him up to the king of Babylon, to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgments against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.10'>And the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also killed all the rulers of Judah in Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.11'>And he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah. And the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.12'>And in the fifth month, in the tenth of the month, which [was] the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, chief of the executioners, [who] served the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.13'>And he burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house. And he burned with fire all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.14'>And all the army of the Chaldeans with the chief of the executioners broke down all Jerusalem's walls all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.15'>And Nebuzaradan the chief of the executioners exiled [some] of the poor of the people, and the rest of the people who remained in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.16'>But Nebuzaradan the chief of the executioners left [some] of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for farmers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.17'>Also the Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that [were] in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the bronze sea in the house of the LORD, and carried all the bronze of them to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.18'>They also took away the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they served.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.19'>And the chief of the executioners took away the basins, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the spoons, and the cups; what [was] gold, [in] gold; and what [was] silver, [in] silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.20'>the two pillars, one sea, and twelve bronze bulls that [were] under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD; the bronze of all these vessels was without weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.21'>And the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits. And a line of twelve cubits went around it, and the thickness of it [was] four fingers. [It was] hollow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.22'>And a capital of bronze [was] on it. And the height of one capital [was] five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capitals all around, all [of] bronze. The second pillar also, and the pomegranates, [were] like these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.23'>And there were ninety-six pomegranates on a side; all the pomegranates on the network [were] a hundred all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.24'>And the chief of the executioners took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.25'>He also took out of the city a eunuch who was in charge of the men of war; and seven men from those who were near the king's person, who were found in the city; and the chief scribe of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the middle of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.26'>And Nebuzaradan the chief of the executioners took them and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.27'>And the king of Babylon struck them and slaughtered them in Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was exiled out of his own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.28'>This [is] the people whom Nebuchadnezzar exiled: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.29'>in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he exiled from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.30'>in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the chief of the executioners exiled seven hundred and forty-five persons of the Jews. All the persons [were] four thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.31'>And it happened in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty-fifth of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the [first] year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him out from prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.32'>and spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who [were] with him in Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.33'>And he changed his prison garments, and he ate bread before him all the days of his life.</verse>
