      <chapter osisID='Gen.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>And the earth was without form and empty. And darkness [was] on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>And God said, Let there be light. And there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>And God saw the light that [it was] good. And God divided between the light and the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>And God called the light, Day. And He called the darkness, Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>And God said, Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters [from] the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>And God made the expanse, and divided the waters which [were] under the expanse from the waters which [were] above the expanse; and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>And God called the expanse, Heavens. And the evening and the morning were the second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>And God called the dry land, Earth. And He called the gathering together of the waters, Seas. And God saw that [it was] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>And God said, Let the earth bring forth tender sprouts ( the] herb seeding seed [and] the fruit tree producing fruit after its kind, whose seed [is] in itself) upon the earth; and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>And the earth brought forth tender sprouts, [the] herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree producing fruit after its kind, whose seed [was] in itself. And God saw that [it was] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>And the evening and the morning were the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to divide between the day and the night. And let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>And let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>And God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day and the smaller light to rule the night, and the stars [also.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>and to rule over the day and over the night; and to divide between the light and the darkness. And God saw that [it was] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>And God said, Let the waters swarm [with] swarmers [having] a living soul; and let birds fly over the earth on the face of the expanse of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>And God created great sea-animals, and every living soul that creeps [with] which the waters swarmed after their kind; and every winged fowl after its kind. And God saw that [it was] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters of the seas and let the fowl multiply in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle, and creepers, and its beasts of the earth after its kind; and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'>And God made the beasts of the earth after its kind, and cattle after their kind, and all creepers upon the earth after their kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>And God said, Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over all the creepers creeping on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'>And God created man in His image; in the image of God He created him. He created them male and female.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'>And God blessed them. And God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply and fill the earth, and subdue it. And have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the heavens, and all animals that move upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>And God said, Behold! I have given you every herb seeding seed which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which [is the] fruit of a tree seeding seed; to you it shall be for food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to every creeper on the earth which [has] in it a living soul every green plant [is] for food; and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'>And God saw everything that He had made, and behold, [it was] very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made. And He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He had rested from all His work which God created to make.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>These [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they [were] created in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>and every shrub of the field was not yet on the earth, and every plant of the field had not yet sprung up. For the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and [there was] no man to till the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>But there went up from the earth a mist and watered all the face of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>And the LORD God formed man [of the] dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden. And there He put the man whom He had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>And out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food. The tree of life also was in the middle of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden. And from there it was divided and became four heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>The name of the first [is] Pishon; that [is it] which surrounds all the land of Havilah, where [there is] gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>And the gold of that land [is] good. There [is] bdellium and the onyx stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>And the name of the second river [is] Gihon; it [is] the one that surrounds the whole land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>And the name of the third river [is] Tigris; it [is] that which goes toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river [is] Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>And the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, You may freely eat of every tree in the garden,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>but you shall not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. For in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>And the LORD God said, [It is] not good that the man should be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>And out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal of the field and every fowl of the air, and brought [them] to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called [each] living creature, that [was] its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>And Adam gave names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field. But there was not found a suitable helper for Adam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept. And He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh underneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>And the LORD God made the rib (which He had taken from the man) into a woman. And He brought her to the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>And Adam said, This [is] now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. [She] shall be called Woman because [she] was taken out of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife and they shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'>And they were both naked, the man and his wife; and they were not ashamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, [Is it] so that God has said, You shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the middle of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>for God knows that in the day you eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it was pleasing to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make wise, she took of its fruit, and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>And the eyes of both of them were opened. And they knew that they [were] naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made girdles for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God in the middle of the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>And the LORD God called to Adam and said to him, Where [are] you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>And he said, I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I [am] naked, and I hid myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>And He said, Who told you that you [were] naked? Have you eaten of the tree which I commanded you that you should not eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>And the man said, The woman whom You gave [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>And the LORD God said to the woman, What [is] this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because you have done this you [are] cursed more than all cattle, and more than every animal of the field. You shall go upon your belly, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He will bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>To the woman He said, I will greatly increase your sorrow and your conception. In pain you shall bear sons, and your desire shall be toward your husband, and he shall rule over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>And to Adam He said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat [of] it! The ground [is] cursed for your sake. In pain shall you eat of it all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>It shall also bring forth thorns and thistles to you, and you shall eat the herb of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you [are], and to dust you shall return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>And for Adam and his wife the LORD God made coats of skins, and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>And the LORD God said, Behold, the man has become as one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he had been taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>And He drove out the man. And He placed cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>And Adam knew Eve his wife. And she conceived and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>And she bore again, his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>And in the end of days, it happened, Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>And Abel also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat of it. And the LORD had respect to Abel and to his offering,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>but He did not have respect to Cain and to his offering. And Cain glowed with anger, and his face fell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>And the LORD said to Cain, Why have you angrily glowed? And why did your face fall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>If you do well, shall you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin crouches at the door; and its desire [is] for you, and you shall rule over it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>And Cain talked with his brother Abel. And it happened when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>And the LORD said unto Cain, Where [is] your brother Abel? And he said, I do not know. [Am] I my brother's keeper?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>And He said, What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries to Me from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>And now you [are] cursed more than the ground which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>When you till the ground, it will not again give its strength to you. And you shall be a vagabond and a fugitive in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment [is] greater than I can bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>Behold! You have driven me out from the face of the earth today, and I shall be hidden from Your face. And I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth, and it shall be [that] anyone who finds me shall kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever kills Cain shall be avenged seven times. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain so that anyone who found him should not kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and lived in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>And Irad was born to Enoch. And Irad fathered Mehujael. And Mehujael fathered Methusael. And Methusael fathered Lamech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>And Lamech took two wives to himself. The name of the first one [was] Adah, and the name of the other [was] Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents, and with cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>And his brother's name [was] Jubal; he was the father of all those playing the harp and the organ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>And Zillah also bore Tubalcain, [the] hammerer of every engraving tool of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, wives of Lamech, listen to my speech. For I have killed a man because of my wound, and a young man because of my hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>For Cain is avenged seven times, and Lamech seventy-seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>And Adam knew his wife again. And she bore a son, and called his name Seth. For she said, God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>And there was also a son born to Seth, and he called his name Enos. Then men began to call upon the name of the LORD.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.1'>This [is] the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.18.28'>Perhaps there will be five lacking from the fifty righteous. Will You destroy all the city for lack of five? And He said, If I find there forty-five, I will not destroy [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.29'>And he spoke to Him yet again, and said, Perhaps there shall be forty found there. And He said, I will not do [it] for forty's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.30'>And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak. Perhaps there shall be thirty found there. And He said, I will not do [it] if I find thirty there.</verse>
