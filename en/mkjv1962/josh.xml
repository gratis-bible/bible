      <chapter osisID='Josh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'>And it happened after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'>My servant Moses is dead. Now, therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people to the land which I give to them, to the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, I have given that to you, as I said to Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'>From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'>No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, [so] I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'>Be strong and of good courage. For you shall divide for an inheritance to this people, the land which I swore to their fathers, to give it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'>Only be strong and very courageous so that you may be careful to do according to all the law which My servant Moses commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may act wisely wherever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'>This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it by day and by night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall act wisely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'>Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage. Do not be afraid, neither be dismayed. For the LORD your God [is] with you in all places where you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'>Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare food for yourselves, for within three days you are crossing over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'>And Joshua spoke to the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to half the tribe of Manasseh, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'>Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you saying, The LORD your God has given you rest and has given you this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan. But you shall go armed before your brothers, all the mighty men of valor, and help them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'>until the LORD has given your brothers rest, even as you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God gives them; and you shall return to the land of your possession and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave you on this side Jordan, towards the sunrise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'>And they answered Joshua, saying: We will do all that you command us, and wherever you send us we will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'>Just as we listened to Moses in all things, so we will listen to you. Only may the LORD your God be with you as He was with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'>Whoever rebels against your command and will not listen to your words in all that you command him, he shall be put to death. Only be strong and of a good courage.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'>And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go look over the land, even Jericho. And they went and came to the house of a harlot named Rahab. And they stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'>And the king of Jericho was told about it, saying, Behold, men from the sons of Israel came in here tonight, to search out the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring out the men that have come to you, those who have entered into your house. For they have come to search out all the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'>And the woman took the two men and hid them. And she said, Two men came to me, but I did not know from where they came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'>And it happened when it was dark, [at the time of] shutting the gate, the men went out. Where the men went I do not know. Go after them quickly, for you shall overtake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'>But she had brought them up on the roof, and had hidden them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'>And the men went after them on the way to Jordan, to the fords. And when they who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'>And before they had laid down, she came up to them on the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.9'>And she said to the men, I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that your terror has fallen on us, and that all those who live in the land faint because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'>For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'>And we had heard, and our hearts melted, nor did any more spirit remain in any man, because of you. For the LORD your God, He is God in Heaven above and in earth beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'>Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have dealt with you in kindness, that you will also deal with kindness to my father's house. And give me a true token,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'>and shall save alive my father and my mother, and my brothers and my sisters, and all that they [have], and deliver our lives from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'>And the men answered her, Our life shall be for yours, if you do not tell our business. And when the LORD has given us the land, we will deal kindly and truly with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'>Then she let them go down by a cord through the window. For her house [was] on the town wall, and she lived on the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'>And she said to them, Get up into the mountain lest the pursuers meet you. And hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers have returned. And afterward you may go your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'>And the men said to her, We [will be] blameless of this oath to you which you have made us swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'>Behold, [when] we come into the land, you shall set this line of scarlet thread in the window from which you let us down. And you shall bring your father and your mother, and your brothers, and all your father's household, home to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'>And it shall be, whoever shall go out of the doors of your house, his blood [shall be] on his head, and we [will be] blameless. And whoever shall be with you in the house, his blood [shall be] on our head if a hand is on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'>And if you tell our business, then we will be free of the oath which you have made us swear to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'>And she said, Let [it be] according to your word. And she sent them away, and they departed. And she set the scarlet line in the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'>And they went and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days until the pursuers had returned. And the pursuers looked for [them] throughout all the way, but did not find [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'>And the two men returned and came down from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun. And they told him all that happened to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'>And they said to Joshua, Truly the LORD has delivered all the land into our hands, for even all those who live in the country faint because of us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'>And Joshua rose early in the morning. And they moved from Shittim and came to Jordan, he and all the sons of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'>And it happened after three days the officers went through the host.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'>And [they] commanded the people saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall move from your place and go after it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'>Yet keep a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near it, so that you may know the way by which you must go. For you have not passed [this] way before now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'>And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'>And Joshua spoke to the priests saying, Take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'>And the LORD said to Joshua, Today, I will begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel so that they may know that I will be with you, as I was with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'>And you shall command the priests that carry the ark of the covenant, saying, When you have come to the brink of the water of Jordan, you shall stand still in Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'>And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, Come here and hear the words of the LORD your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'>And Joshua said, By this you shall know that the living God [is] among you, and He will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'>And now take yourselves twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'>And it shall be, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that carry the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, the waters of Jordan shall be cut off [from] the waters that come down from above. And they shall stand all in a heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'>And it happened, when the people moved from their tents to pass over Jordan, and as the priests carried the ark of the covenant before the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'>and as those who bore the ark had come to Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the edge of the water (for Jordan overflows all its banks, all the time of harvest);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'>that the waters which came down from above stopped [and] rose up all in a heap, very far from the city Adam that [is] beside Zaretan. And those that came down toward the sea of the plain, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. And the people passed over across from Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'>And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of Jordan. And all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people had passed completely over Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'>And it happened when all the people had completely passed over the Jordan, the LORD spoke to Joshua saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'>Take twelve men for you out of the people, a man out of every tribe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'>and command them saying, Take twelve stones from here, out of the middle of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm. And you shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the place where you shall stay tonight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'>Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared from the sons of Israel, a man out of every tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'>And Joshua said to them, Pass over in front of the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. And every man take a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'>so that this may be a sign to you when your sons ask in time to come, saying, What do you [mean] by these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'>Then you shall answer them, The waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off, and these stones shall be for a memorial to the sons of Israel forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'>And the sons of Israel did as Joshua commanded. And they took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as the LORD spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they stayed, and laid them down there;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'>even the twelve stones Joshua lifted up in the middle of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant, stood. And they are there to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'>For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan until everything was finished, all that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. And the people hurried and passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'>And it happened, when all the people had finished passing over, the ark of the LORD and the priests passed over before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'>And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed in front of the sons of Israel, as Moses spoke to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'>about forty thousand armed men of the army passed over before the LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'>On that day the LORD made Joshua great in the sight of all Israel. And they feared him, even as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.15'>And the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.16'>Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.17'>Joshua, therefore, commanded the priests saying, Come up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.18'>And it happened, when the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come up out of the midst of the Jordan, the soles of the feet of the priests were lifted up to the dry land, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and flowed over all its banks, as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.19'>And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth of the first month, and camped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.20'>And those twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan, were raised by Joshua in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.21'>And he spoke to the sons of Israel saying, When your sons shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What do these stones [mean] ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.22'>Then you shall let your sons know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.23'>For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you until you had passed over, even as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea which He dried up from before us until we had gone over;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.24'>so that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, [is] mighty and so that you might fear the LORD your God forever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'>And it happened, when all the kings of the Amorites who [were] on the west side of the Jordan, and all the kings of the Canaanites who [were] by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan in front of the sons of Israel until we had passed over, that their hearts melted. Neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'>At that time the LORD said to Joshua, Make sharp knives for yourselves and circumcise the sons of Israel again, the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.3'>And Joshua made sharp knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.4'>And this [is] the reason why Joshua circumcised. All the people that came out of Egypt, the males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the wayside, after they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.5'>For all the people who came out were circumcised. But all the people born in the wilderness by the wayside, as they came forth out of Egypt, had not been circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.6'>For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the people, the men of war, who came out of Egypt, were destroyed, because they did not obey the voice of the LORD. To them the LORD swore that He would not show them the land which the LORD swore to their fathers that He would give us, a land that flows with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.7'>And Joshua circumcised their sons, [whom] He raised up in their place. For they were not circumcised, because they had not been circumcised by the wayside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.8'>And it happened when they had finished circumcising all the people, they stayed in their places in the camp until they were well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.9'>And the LORD said to Joshua, Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you. Therefore, the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.10'>And the sons of Israel camped in Gilgal and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.11'>And they ate of the old grain of the land on the next day after the Passover, unleavened cakes and roasted grain in the same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.12'>And the manna stopped on the next day after they had eaten the old grain of the land. And there was no more manna to the sons of Israel, but they ate the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.13'>And it happened, when Joshua was beside Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked. And, behold, there stood a Man in front of him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, [Are] You for us, or for our foes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.14'>And He said, No, but I have come [as] the Commander of the army of the LORD. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth. And he worshiped and said to Him, What does my Lord say to His servant?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.15'>And the Commander of the LORD's army said to Joshua, Take your shoe off your foot, for the place on which you stand [is] holy. And Joshua did so.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.1'>And Jericho was completely shut up because of the sons of Israel. None went out and none came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.2'>And the LORD said to Joshua, See, I have given Jericho into your hand, and its king, [and] the mighty men of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.3'>And you shall go around the city, all the men of war. Go around the city once. So you shall do for six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.4'>And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of ram's horns in front of the ark. And the seventh day you shall go around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.5'>And it shall be when they make a long [blast] with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout. And the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up, each man straight before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.6'>And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry seven ram's horns in front of the ark of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.7'>And he said to the people, Pass on, and go around the city. And let him who is armed pass on in front of the ark of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.8'>And it happened when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven ram's horns passed on before the LORD and blew the ram's horns. And the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.9'>And the armed men went before the priests who blew with the ram's horns. And the gathering army came after the ark, as [the priests] were going on and blowing with the ram's horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.10'>And Joshua had commanded the people saying, You shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall [any] word come out of your mouth until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.11'>And the ark of the LORD went around the city, going around [it] once. And they came into the camp and stayed in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.12'>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.13'>And seven priests carrying seven ram's horns before the ark of the LORD went on without stopping and blew with the ram's horns. And the armed men went in front of them. But the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD as [the priests were going on and blowing with the ram's horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.14'>And the second day they went around the city once, and returned to the camp. So they did six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.15'>And it happened on the seventh day they rose early, at the dawning of the day, and circled the city in the same way seven times. Only on that day did they go around the city seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.16'>And it happened, at the seventh time, when the priest blew with the ram's horns, Joshua said to the people, Shout! For the LORD has given you the city!</verse>
