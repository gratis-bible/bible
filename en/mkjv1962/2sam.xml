      <chapter osisID='2Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.1'>And it happened after the death of Saul, David returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David stayed two days in Ziklag,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.2'>on the third day, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes torn and earth upon his head. And it happened when he came to David, he fell to the earth and bowed to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.3'>And David said to him, Where do you come from? And he said to him, I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.4'>And David said to him, How did the matter go? Please tell me. And he answered, The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.5'>And David said to the young man who told him, How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan [are] dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.6'>And the young man who told him said, As I happened to be upon Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear. And, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.7'>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here [am] I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.8'>And he said to me, Who [are] you? And I answered him, I [am] an Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.9'>He said to me again, Please stand over me and kill me, for anguish has come upon me, because all my life [is] still in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.10'>And I stood over him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown on his head, and [the] bracelet on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.11'>And David took hold on his garments, and tore them. And likewise all the men with him [did] so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.12'>And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for his son Jonathan, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.13'>And David said to the young man who told him, From where [are] you? And he answered, I [am] the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.14'>And David said, Why were you not afraid to stretch forth your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.15'>And David called one of the young men and said, Go near; fall on him. And he struck him so that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.16'>And David said to him, Your blood [be] upon your head, for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.17'>And David chanted this death dirge over Saul and over his son Jonathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.18'>And he said to teach the sons of Judah [The Song of] the Bow. Behold, it is written in the Book of Jasher:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.19'>The beauty of Israel is slain upon your high places! How are the mighty fallen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.20'>Tell [it] not in Gath, do not let it be known in the streets of Askelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.21'>Mountains of Gilboa, [let] not dew or rain [be] on you, nor fields of offerings. For there the shield of the mighty has been evilly cast away, the shield of Saul not [being] anointed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.22'>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.23'>Saul and Jonathan [were] lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided. They were swifter than eagles; they were stronger than lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.24'>Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and with delights; who put ornaments of gold on your clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.25'>How [are] the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.26'>I [am] distressed for you, my brother Jonathan. Very pleasant you have been to me. Your love to me was wonderful, more than the love of women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.27'>How [are] the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.1'>And it happened after this, David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said to him, Go up! And David said, Where shall I go? And He said, To Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.2'>And David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.3'>And David brought up his men with him, each man with his household. And they lived in the cities of Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.4'>And the men of Judah came, and they anointed David king over the house of Judah there. And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead buried Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.5'>And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead. And he said to them, Blessed [are] you of the LORD, that you have shown this kindness to your lord, to Saul, and have buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.6'>And now may the LORD do kindness and truth to you. And I also do good to you, because you have done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.7'>And now let your hands be strengthened, and be brave. For your master Saul [is] dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.8'>But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.9'>And [he] made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.10'>Ishbosheth, Saul's son, [was] forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.11'>And it happened, the number of days that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.12'>And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.13'>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and met by the pool of Gibeon and sat down, the one on the one [side] of the pool, and the other on the other [side] of the pool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.14'>And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.15'>And they arose and went over by number, twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul; and twelve of the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.16'>And each one lay hold on the head, of his companion and [thrust] his sword in his companion's side, so that they fell together. And [one] called that place The Field of Rocks, which is in Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.17'>And there was a very grievous battle that day. And Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.18'>And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel. And Asahel [was] swift with his feet, like one of the gazelles in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.19'>And Asahel ran after Abner, and in going he did not turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.20'>And Abner looked behind him and said, [Are] you Asahel? And he answered, I [am].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.21'>And Abner said to him, Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay hold on one of the young men, and take for yourself. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.22'>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.23'>However he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him with the blunt end of the spear in the belly, and the spear came out behind him. And he fell down there, and died in the same place. And it happened that everyone who came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.24'>And Joab and Abishai ran after Abner. And the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, which [lies] before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.25'>And the sons of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of a hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.26'>Then Abner called to Joab and said, Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the end? How long shall it be then before you command the people to return from chasing their brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.27'>And Joab said, [As] God lives, unless you had spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone up each one from following his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.28'>And Joab blew a ram's horn, and all the people stood still and did not pursue after Israel any more, nor did they fight any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.29'>And Abner and his men went all that night through the plain and passed over Jordan, and went all the forenoon and came to Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.30'>And Joab returned from following Abner. And when [he] had gathered all the people together, nineteen men and Asahel were missing from David's servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.31'>But the servants of David had stricken three hundred and sixty men of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, who died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.32'>And they took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which [was in] Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at the break of day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.1'>And there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. But David [became] stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.2'>And sons were born to David in Hebron. And his first-born [was] Amnon, [the son of] Ahinoam of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.3'>And his second was Chileab, of Abigail of Carmel, the former wife of Nabal. And the third [was] Absalom, the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.4'>And the fourth [was] Adonijah, the son of Haggith. And the fifth [was] Shephatiah, the son of Abital.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.5'>And the sixth [was] Ithream, by Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.6'>And it happened, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.7'>And Saul had a concubine whose name [was] Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And [Ishbosheth] said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.8'>And Abner was very angry over the words of Ishbosheth, and said, [Am] I a dog's head, who shows kindness against Judah this day to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David? [Am] I a dog's head that you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman today?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.9'>So may God do to Abner, and more also, if I do not do to David as the LORD has sworn,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.10'>to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.11'>And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.12'>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose [is] the land? He said, Cut your covenant with me, and, behold, my hand [shall be] with you, to bring about all Israel to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.13'>And he said, Good! I will cut a covenant with you, but one thing I ask of you, saying, You shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.14'>And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying, Deliver my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.15'>And Ishbosheth sent and took her from [her] husband, from Phaltiel the son of Laish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.16'>And her husband went along with her, weeping behind her, to Bahurim. And Abner said to him, Go, return! And he returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.17'>The word of Abner was with the elders of Israel, saying, You sought for David in times past [to be] king over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.18'>And then do [it], for the LORD has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.19'>And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin. And Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and all that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.20'>And Abner came to David at Hebron, and twenty men came with him. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who [were] with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.21'>And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and so that you may reign over all that your heart desires. And David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.22'>And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from [pursuing] a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them. But Abner [was] not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.23'>And Joab and all the army with him came, and they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.24'>And Joab came to the king and said, What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why [is] this, [that] you have sent him away, and he has already gone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.25'>You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.26'>And Joab left David and sent messengers after Abner, who brought him again from the well of Sirah. But David did not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.27'>And Abner returned to Hebron. And Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him privately. And [he] struck him there in the belly, and he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.28'>And afterward David heard, and said, My kingdom and I [are] guiltless before the LORD forever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.29'>Let it whirl about the head of Joab, and on all his father's house. And let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls on the sword, or who lacks bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.30'>And Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.31'>And David said to Joab and to all the people with him, Tear your clothes and gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.32'>And they buried Abner in Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner. And all the people wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.33'>And the king mourned over Abner and said, Did Abner die like a fool dies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.34'>Your hands [were] not bound, nor your feet put into fetters; as a man falls before wicked men, so you fell. And all the people wept again over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.35'>And all the people came to cause David to eat food while it was still day; David swore, saying, So let God do to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else until the sun is down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.36'>And all the people took notice, and it pleased them, as whatever the king did pleased all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.37'>For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.38'>And the king said to his servants, Do you not know that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.39'>And I [am] weak this day, though anointed king. And these men, the sons of Zeruiah, [are] too hard for me. The LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.1'>And Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron. And his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.2'>And Saul's son had two men [that were] captains of bands. The name of the one [was] Baanah, and the name of the other was Rechab, the sons of Rimmon of Beeroth, of the sons of Benjamin. For Beeroth also was counted to Benjamin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.3'>and the men of Beeroth fled to Gittaim and were strangers there until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.4'>And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who [was] lame in [his] feet. He was five years old when the news of Saul and Jonathan came out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled. And as she made haste to flee he fell and became lame. And his name [was] Mephibosheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.5'>And the sons of Rimmon of Beeroth, Rechab and Baanah, came at the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth. And he was lying [on his] bed [at] noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.6'>And they came to the midst of the house, bringing wheat. And they struck him in the belly. And Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.7'>And they came into the house, and he lay in his bed in his bedroom. And they struck him and killed him, and beheaded him and took his head and got away through the plain all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.8'>And [they] brought the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron. and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, your enemy who sought your life. And the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and of his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.9'>And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon of Beeroth, and said to them, [As] the Lord lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.10'>when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, [thinking] to have brought good news, I took hold of him and killed him in Ziklag. I gave that to him as a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.11'>Indeed when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.12'>And David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged [them] up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner in Hebron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.1'>And all the tribes of Israel came to David, to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we [are] your bone and your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.2'>Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were he who led Israel out and brought them in. And the LORD said to you, You shall feed My people Israel, and you shall be a leader over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.3'>And all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron. And king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD. And they anointed David king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.4'>David [was] thirty years old when he began to reign. He reigned forty years.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.3'>And Absalom said to him, See! Your matters [are] good and right. But no listener from the king [will hear] you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.4'>And Absalom said, Oh that I might be made judge in the land, so that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.5'>And it was [so], when any man came near to bow down to him, he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.12'>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel of Giloh, David's counselor, from his city Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people with Absalom grew more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.13'>And a messenger came to David saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.14'>And David said to all his servants with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee! For [otherwise] we shall not escape from Absalom. Make haste to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.8'>For, Hushai said, you know your father and his men, that they [are] mighty men, and they [are] bitter of soul, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. And your father [is] a man of war, and will not stay the night with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.9'>Behold, he is hidden now in some pit, or in one of the places. And it shall be, at the falling among them at the first, whoever hears will say, There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.11'>Therefore I advise that all Israel be generally gathered to you, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, like the sand that [is] by the sea for multitude. And you yourself shall go into battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.12'>And we shall come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him like the dew falls upon the ground. And of all the men that [are] with him, not even one shall be left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.13'>And if he has gotten into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river until there is not one small stone found there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.14'>And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite [is] better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil on Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.15'>And Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, This and this Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this and this I have advised.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.21'>And it happened after they had departed, they came up out of the well, and went and told King David. And [they] said to David, Arise and pass quickly over the waters, for this is what Ahithophel has advised against you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.1'>And these [are] the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.2'>The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, and His word [was] in my tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.3'>The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me: he who rules over men justly, ruling [in] the fear of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.4'>is as the light of the morning, as the sun rises, a morning without clouds. The tender grass [springs] out of the earth through shining after rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.5'>Although my house [is] not so with God, yet He has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure. For all my salvation, and all my desire, will He not make it grow?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.6'>But the wicked, all of them, [shall be] like a thorn thrust away, because they cannot be taken by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.7'>But the man who shall touch them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear. And they shall be utterly burned in [their] place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.8'>These [are] the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth the Tachmonite, chief of the three; he [was called] Adino the Eznite, because of the eight hundred [he] killed at one time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.9'>And after him [was] Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there to battle; and the men of Israel had gone up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.10'>[he] arose and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and until his hand clung to the sword. And the LORD worked a great victory that day. And the people returned after him only to spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.11'>And next [was] Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where there was a piece of ground full of lentils. And the people fled from the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.12'>But he stood in the middle of the ground and delivered it, and killed the Philistines. And the LORD worked a great victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.13'>And three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David in the harvest time into the cave of Adullam. And the troop of the Philistines pitched in the Valley of the Giants.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.15'>And David longed and said, Oh that someone would give me a drink from the water of the well of Bethlehem by the gate!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.16'>And the three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem by the gate, and took [it], and brought [it] to David. But he would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.17'>And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this. [Is it not] the blood of the men who went [in danger of] their lives? And he would not drink it. These three mighty men did these [things].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.18'>And Abishai the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, [was] chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred [and] killed [them], and had the name among three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.19'>Surely he was honored more than the three. And he was their commander. However he did not attain to the [first] three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.20'>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada from Kabzeel, a son of a mighty man, great [in] deeds. He killed two lion-like men of Moab. He went down also and killed a lion in the middle of a pit in time of snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.21'>And he killed an Egyptian, a man of form. And the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.22'>These [things] did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty ones.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.1'>And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and He moved David against them to say, Go count Israel and Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.2'>For the king said to Joab the commander of the army, who [was] with him, Go around through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beer-sheba, and count the people so that I may know the number of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.3'>And Joab said to the king, And may the LORD your God add to the people however many they be, a hundred times as many, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king delight in this thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.4'>But the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the commanders of the army. And Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.5'>And they passed over Jordan and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that [is] in the middle of the Valley of Gad, and to Jazer.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.10'>And David's heart struck him after he had numbered the people. And David said to the LORD, I have sinned greatly in what I have done. And now, I beseech You, O LORD, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.11'>And David rose up in the morning. And the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.12'>Go and say to David, So says the LORD, I offer you three [things]. Choose one of them, so that I may do [it] to you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.22'>And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what [seems] good to him. Behold, oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments, and instruments of the oxen for wood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.25'>And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And the LORD was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</verse>
