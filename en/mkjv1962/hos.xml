      <chapter osisID='Hos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.1'>The Word of the LORD that came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.2'>The beginning of the LORD speaking by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take to yourself a wife of adultery and children of adultery. For the land has utterly gone lusting away from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.3'>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, who conceived and bore him a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.4'>And the LORD said to him, Call his name God Will Sow. For still [in] a little [while], and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.5'>And it shall be, at that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.6'>And she conceived again and bore a daughter. And [God] said to him, Call her name No-mercy, for I will no more have mercy [on] the house of Israel. But I will utterly take them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.7'>But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.8'>And when she had weaned No-mercy she conceived and bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.9'>And He said, Call his name Not-my-people. For you [are] not My people, and I will not be for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.10'>Yet the number of the sons of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered. And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them, You [are] not My people, there it shall be said to them, [You are the sons of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.11'>Then the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel shall be gathered together, and shall set over themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land. For great [shall be] the day of Jezreel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.1'>Say to your brothers, A People; and to your sisters, Mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.2'>Contend! Contend with your mother, for she [is] not my wife, nor am I her husband. Let her therefore put away her fornications out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.3'>lest I strip her naked and set her out as in the day that she was born; and lest I make her as the wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.4'>And I will not have mercy on her sons, for they [are] the sons of adulteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.5'>For their mother has prostituted [herself]. She who conceived them has done shamefully. For she said, I will go after my lovers who give my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.6'>Therefore behold, I will hedge your way with thorns, and wall up her wall, that she shall not find her paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.7'>And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them. She shall seek them, but shall not find [them]. Then she shall say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then [it was] better with me than now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.8'>For she did not know that I gave her grain, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, [which] they prepared for Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.9'>So I will return and take away My grain in its time, and my wine in its season, and will recover my wool and my flax [given] to cover her nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.10'>And now I will uncover her shamefulness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.11'>I will also cause all her joy to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her appointed feasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.12'>And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, of which she has said, They [are] my rewards that my lovers have given me. And I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.13'>And I will visit on her the days of the Baals, in which she burned incense to them, and she adorned herself with her nose-rings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers and forgot Me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.14'>Therefore, behold, I will lure her and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.15'>And I will give her vineyards to her from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope. And she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.16'>And it shall be at that day, says the LORD, you shall call Me, My Husband, and shall no more call Me, My Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.17'>For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they will no more be remembered by their name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.18'>And in that day I will cut a covenant for them, with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and [with] the creeping things of the ground. And I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.19'>And I will betroth you to Me forever. Yea, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.20'>I will even betroth you to Me in faithfulness. And you shall know the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.21'>And it will be, in that day I will answer, says the LORD. I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.22'>and the earth shall hear the grain and the wine and the oil. And they shall hear Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.23'>And I will sow her to Me in the earth. And I will have mercy on No-mercy. And I will say to Not-my-people, You are My people. And they shall say, My God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.1'>And the LORD said to me, Go again. Love a woman beloved by a friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the sons of Israel, who turn to other gods, and love raisin-cakes of grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.2'>So I bought her to me for fifteen [pieces of] silver, and [for] a homer of barley and a half homer of barley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.3'>And I said to her, You shall abide for me many days. You shall not be a harlot, nor be for a man. And I also [will be] for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.4'>For the sons of Israel shall live many days [with] no king, and no ruler, and with no sacrifice, and no pillars, and no ephod, or teraphim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.5'>Afterward the sons of Israel shall return and seek the LORD their God and David their king. And they shall fear the LORD and His goodness in the ends of the days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.1'>Hear the Word of the LORD, sons of Israel. For the LORD [has] a quarrel with the people of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.2'>There is lying, and swearing, and killing, and stealing, and the committing of adultery; and blood touches blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.3'>Therefore the land shall mourn, and everyone who dwells in it shall droop, with the beasts of the field and with the birds of the heavens. Yes, the fish of the sea shall also be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.4'>Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another. For your people [are] as those who strive with the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.5'>And you shall stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with you [in the] night, and I will cut off your mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.6'>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you from being priest to Me. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your sons, even I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.7'>As they were increased, so they sinned against Me. I will change their glory into shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.8'>They eat up the sin of My people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.9'>And it has become, Like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them for their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.10'>For they shall eat and not have enough. They shall fornicate and not increase, because they have stopped taking heed to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.11'>Fornication and wine and new wine take away the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.12'>My people seek advice from their wooden [idols], and their rod declares to them. For the spirit of harlotry has caused them to go astray, and they have gone lusting away from under their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.13'>They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because its shade is good. So your daughters shall be harlots, and your brides shall commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.14'>I will not punish your daughters when they fornicate, nor your wives when they commit adultery. For the men themselves go aside with harlots, and they sacrifice with temple prostitutes. The people [who] do not understand are thrown down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.15'>Though you, Israel, fornicate, yet do not let Judah become guilty. And do not come [to] Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-aven, nor swear, [As] the LORD lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.16'>For Israel slides back like a backsliding heifer. Now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.17'>Ephraim [is] joined to idols; let him alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.18'>Their drink is sour; they are continually fornicating; her rulers dearly love shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.19'>The wind has bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.1'>Hear this, O priests, and listen, house of Israel. And give ear, house of the king. For judgment [is] toward you, because you have been a snare on Mizpah and a net spread on Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.2'>And revolters have gone deep [in] slaughtering, and I chasten all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.3'>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me. For now, O Ephraim, you have fornicated; Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.4'>Their doings will not allow [them] to turn to their God; for the spirit of fornication [is] in their midst, and they have not known the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.5'>And the pride of Israel testifies to his face. So Israel and Ephraim shall fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.6'>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find Him. He has withdrawn Himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.7'>They have acted treacherously against the LORD, for they have brought out strange sons. Now a new moon shall devour them with their portions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.8'>Blow the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah; cry aloud at Beth-aven, after you, O Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.9'>Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke. Among the tribes of Israel I have made known that which is confirmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.10'>The rulers of Judah were like movers of a border; I will pour out My wrath on them like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.11'>Ephraim [is] crushed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.12'>Therefore I [am] as a moth to Ephraim, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.13'>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then Ephraim went to the Assyrian and sent to king Jareb. Yet he could not heal you nor cure you of your wound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.14'>For I [will be] to Ephraim as a lion, and as a strong lion to the house of Judah. I, [even] I, will tear and go away. I will take away, and none shall rescue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.15'>I will go; I will return to My place until they confess their guilt and seek My face; in their affliction they will seek Me diligently.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.1'>Come and let us return to the LORD. For He has torn, and He will heal us; He has stricken, and He will bind us up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.2'>After two days He will bring us to life; in the third day He will raise us up, and we shall live in His sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.3'>Then we shall know, [if] we follow on to know the LORD. His going out is prepared as the morning; and He shall come to us as the rain, as the latter [and] former rain to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.4'>O Ephraim, what shall I do to you? O Judah, what shall I do to you? For your goodness [is] like a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.5'>So I have cut [them] down by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth. And your judgments [were as] the light that goes out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.6'>For I desired mercy and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.7'>But, like Adam, they have broken the covenant. They have acted like traitors against Me there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.8'>Gilead [is] a city of trouble-makers, slippery with blood marks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.9'>And as troops of robbers wait for a man, the company of priests murder [in] the way of Shechem; for they committed wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.10'>I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel; the harlotry of Ephraim [is] there; Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.11'>Also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed to you, when I return the captivity of My people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.1'>When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria. For they have worked falsehood. And the thief comes in, the troop of robbers plunders outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.2'>And they do not say within their hearts that I remember all their evil. Now their own doings have hemmed them in; they are before My face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.3'>They make the king glad with their evil, and the rulers with their lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.4'>They [are] all adulterers, like an oven heated by the baker; he stops stirring, from kneading the dough, while it is leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.5'>[In] the day of our king, the rulers have sickened themselves [with] the heat of wine. He stretches out his hand with scorners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.6'>For they have brought their heart near like an oven, while they lie in wait. Their baker sleeps at night; in the morning it burns like a flaming fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.7'>They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges. All their kings have fallen; there is none among them who calls to Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.8'>Ephraim mixed himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.9'>Strangers have eaten up his strength, and he does not know. Yea, gray hairs are here and there on him, yet he knows it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.10'>And the pride of Israel testifies to his face. And they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek Him in all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.11'>Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart; they call [to] Egypt; they go [to] Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.12'>When they go, I will spread My net on them; I will bring them down like the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, as a report to their congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.13'>Woe to them! For they have fled from Me. Ruin to them! Because they have sinned against Me. Though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.14'>And they have not cried to Me with their heart, when they howled on their beds; they gather themselves for grain and wine, and they rebel against Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.15'>Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet they think evil against Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.16'>They return, but not to the [Most] High. They are like a deceitful bow; their rulers shall fall by the sword from the rage of their tongue. This [shall be] their scorn in the land of Egypt.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.1'>Put a trumpet to your mouth. [He comes] like an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have broken My covenant and have sinned against My law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.2'>Israel shall cry to Me, My God, we know You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.3'>Israel has thrown off good; the enemy shall pursue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.4'>They have set up kings, but not by Me; they have made rulers, and I knew it not. They have made themselves idols [with] their silver and their gold, so that they may be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.5'>Your calf, O Samaria, has cast [you] off. My anger is kindled against them. Until when will they not attain purity?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.6'>For from Israel it [came] also. The craftsman made it, but [it is] not God. For the calf of Samaria shall be splinters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.7'>For they sow the wind, and they reap the whirlwind. It has no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal; if it does yield, strangers shall swallow it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.8'>Israel is swallowed up; now they shall be among the nations as a vessel in which there is no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.9'>For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself. Ephraim has hired lovers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.10'>Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now I will gather them. And they began to be few, from the burden of the king of rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.11'>Because Ephraim has made many altars to sin, altars shall be to him to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.12'>I have written to him the great things of My law, but they were counted as a strange thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.13'>They sacrifice flesh [for] the sacrifices of My offerings, and eat it; but the LORD does not receive them. Now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins. They shall return [to] Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.14'>For Israel has forgotten his Maker, and builds temples. And Judah has multiplied cities. But I will send a fire on his cities, and it shall burn up her palaces.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.9'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.1'>O Israel, rejoice not for joy, like the peoples. For you have gone lusting away from your God; you have loved a reward on every grain floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.2'>The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.3'>They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.4'>They shall not pour wine to the LORD, nor shall they be pleasing to Him. Their sacrifices [shall be] like the bread of sorrows to them; all who eat of them shall be defiled. For their bread is for their soul, it shall not come into the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.5'>What will you do in the day of meeting, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.6'>For lo, they have left because of destruction. Egypt shall gather them up; Memphis shall bury them. Nettles shall possess the desirable things of their silver; thorns [shall be] in their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.7'>The days of her judgment have come; the days of vengeance have come; Israel shall know it. The prophet is a fool, the spiritual man [is] insane, because of the greatness of your iniquity and the great hatred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.8'>The watchman of Ephraim [was] with my God. The prophet [is] a snare of a fowler in all his ways, [and] hatred in the house of his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.9'>They have deeply corrupted, as [in] days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity; He will punish their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.10'>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the first-fruit in the fig tree at her first time. But they went [to] Baal-peor and set themselves apart to a shameful thing; and they became abominable like that which they loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.11'>Ephraim is like a bird; their glory shall fly away from birth, and from the womb, and from conception.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.12'>Though they bring up their sons, yet I will make them childless, without a man. Yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.13'>Ephraim, when I looked toward Tyre, was planted in a pleasant place. But Ephraim shall bring out his sons to the murderer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.14'>Give them, O Lord; what will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.15'>All their wickedness [is] in Gilgal, for there I hated them. I will drive them out of My house for the wickedness of their doings. I will love them no more; all their rulers [are] revolters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.16'>Ephraim is stricken; their root is dried up; they shall bear no fruit. Yea, though they bear, yet I will slay the beloved ones of their womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.17'>My God shall cast them away because they did not listen to Him. And they shall be wanderers among the nations.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Hos.10'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.1'>Israel [is] an luxuriant vine; he brings out fruit to himself. According to the multitude of his fruit, he has increased the altars. They have made beautiful images according to the goodness of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.2'>Their heart is divided; now they shall be guilty. He shall break down their altars, and He shall spoil their images.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.3'>For now they shall say, We have no king because we did not fear the LORD; what then should a king do to us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.4'>They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant. So judgment springs up like hemlock in the furrows of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.5'>Because of the calves of Beth-aven, the people of Samaria shall dread. For its people shall mourn over it, and its priest rejoiced on it for its glory, because it has departed from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.6'>It shall also be carried to Assyria for a present to king Jareb. Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.7'>As for Samaria, her king is cut off as a bough on the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.8'>Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed. The thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us, and to the hills, Fall on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.9'>O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah. There they stood; the battle against the sons of iniquity did not overtake them in Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.10'>When I desire, I shall bind them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves to their two perversities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.11'>And Ephraim [is] like a trained heifer, trying to tread out. But I passed over on the goodness of her neck. I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.12'>Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground. For [it is] time to seek the LORD, until He comes and rains righteousness on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.13'>You have plowed wickedness; you have reaped iniquity; you have eaten the fruit of lies, because you trusted in your way, in the multitude of your mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.14'>And an uproar shall arise among your peoples, and all your fortresses shall be spoiled, as the ruin [of] Beth-arbel by Shalman in the day of battle. The mother was dashed in pieces on [her] sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.15'>So He does to you, Bethel, because of your great evil. In a morning the king of Israel shall be utterly cut off.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Hos.11'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.1'>When Israel [was] a child, then I loved him and called My son out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.2'>As they called them, so they went from them. They sacrifice to the Baals, and burn incense to graven images.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.3'>I also taught Ephraim to go; He took them on His arm. But they did not know that I healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.4'>I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as those who take off the yoke on their jaws, and I gently give food to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.5'>He shall not return to the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian [shall be] his king, because they refused to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.6'>And the sword shall remain on his cities, and shall destroy his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.7'>And My people are bent on backsliding from Me. Though they called them to the Most High, none at all would exalt [Him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.8'>How shall I give you up, Ephraim? How shall I deliver you, Israel? How shall I make you like Admah? How shall I set you as Zeboim? My heart is turned within Me; My compassions are kindled together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.9'>I will not carry out the heat of My anger; I will not return to destroy Ephraim. For I [am] God and not man, the Holy One in your midst; and I will not enter into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.10'>They shall walk after the LORD; He shall roar like a lion. When He shall roar, then the sons shall tremble from the west.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.11'>They shall tremble like a bird out of Egypt, and like a dove out of the land of Assyria. And I will place them in their houses, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.12'>Ephraim [circles] around Me with lying, and the house of Israel with deceit. But Judah still rules with God, and is faithful with the saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.12'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.1'>Ephraim feeds on wind and follows after the east wind. He daily multiplies lies and cruelty. And they make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.2'>The LORD also has a quarrel with Judah and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings He will repay him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.3'>He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.4'>Yes, he wept and cried to Him, and he had power over the Angel and overcame. He found him [in] Bethel, and there He spoke with us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.5'>even the LORD God of hosts. Jehovah [is] his memorial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.6'>Therefore turn to your God; keep mercy and judgment, and wait on your God forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.7'>He [is] a merchant; the scales of deceit [are] in his hand; he loves to oppress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.8'>And Ephraim said, Yet I have become rich, I have found much wealth for myself. [In] all my labors they shall find in me no iniquity that is sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.9'>And I the LORD, who have been your God from the land of Egypt, will yet make you to dwell in tents as in the days of the appointed feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.10'>I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions and have used parables by the hand of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.11'>[Is there] iniquity in Gilead? Surely they are vanity; they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal. Yes, their altars [are] as heaps in the furrows of the fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.12'>And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept watch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.13'>And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was kept safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.14'>Ephraim provoked [Me] to anger most bitterly; therefore he shall leave his blood on him, and his Lord shall turn his reproach to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.13'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.1'>When Ephraim spoke trembling, he was lifted up in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.2'>And now they sin more and more, and have made themselves a molten image of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen. They say of them, Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.3'>Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passes away, as the chaff storm-driven out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.4'>Yet I [am] the LORD your God from the land of Egypt, and you shall know no God but Me. For there is no Savior besides Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.5'>I have known you in the wilderness, in the land of great dryness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.6'>According to their pasture, so were they filled. They were filled and their heart was lifted up. Therefore they have forgotten Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.7'>Therefore I will be as a lion to them; as a leopard by the way I will watch them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.8'>I will meet them like a bereaved bear, and will tear the lining of their heart. And there I will devour them like a lion; the wild beast shall tear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.9'>O Israel, you have destroyed yourself; but in Me [is] your help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.10'>Where [is] your king now, that he may save you in all your cities; and your judges of whom you said, Give me a king and rulers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.11'>I gave you a king in My anger, and took [him] away in My wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.12'>The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.13'>The pains of a woman in travail shall come to him. He [is] an unwise son; for he cannot stand still in the time of the breaking forth of sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.14'>I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death. O Death, where [are] your plagues; O Grave, where [is] your ruin! Repentance shall be hidden from My eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.15'>Though he is fruitful among his brothers, an east wind shall come. The wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall be ashamed, and his fountain shall be dried up. He shall plunder the treasure of all desirable vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.16'>Samaria shall become a waste, for she has rebelled against her God. They shall fall by the sword. Their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women shall be ripped up.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.14'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.1'>O Israel, return to the LORD your God, for you have fallen by your iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.2'>Take with you words, and turn to the LORD. Say to Him, Take away all iniquity, and receive [us] graciously, that we may repay [with] the calves of our lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.3'>Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride on horses. Nor shall we say any more to the work of our hands, Our gods, for in You the fatherless finds mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.4'>I will heal their backslidings; I will love them freely; for My anger has turned away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.5'>I will be as the dew to Israel; he shall grow as the lily and cast out his roots like Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.6'>His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.7'>They who dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive like the grain, and grow like the vine. Their scent [shall be] as the wine of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.8'>Ephraim [shall say], What [have] I to do any more with idols? I have heard [him] and watched him; I [am] like a green fir tree. Your fruit is found from Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.9'>Who [is] wise, and he shall understand these things? Understanding, and he shall know them? For the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them; but sinners shall fall in them.</verse>
