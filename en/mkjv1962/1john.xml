      <chapter osisID='1John.1'>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.1'>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.2'>(for the Life was revealed, and we have seen [it] and bear witness, and show to you the everlasting Life, who was with the Father and was revealed to us),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.3'>that which we have seen and heard we declare unto you, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And truly our fellowship [is] with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.4'>And we write these things to you so that your joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.5'>And this is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you, that God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.6'>If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.7'>But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.8'>If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.9'>If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.10'>If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His Word is not in us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.2'>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>My little children, I write these things to you so] that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ [the] righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'>And He is [the] propitiation concerning our sins, and not concerning ours only, but also concerning [the sins of] all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'>And by this we know that we have known Him, if we keep His commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'>He who says, I have known Him, and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.5'>But whoever keeps His Word, truly in this one the love of God is perfected. By this we know that we are in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.6'>He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk even as He walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'>Brothers, I do not write a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from [the] beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from [the] beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'>Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true Light now shines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'>He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in darkness until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'>He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no offense in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'>But he who hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because darkness has blinded his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.12'>I write to you, little children, because [your] sins are forgiven you for His name's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'>I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him [who is] from [the] beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'>I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him [who is] from [the] beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Do not love the world, nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'>because all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'>And the world passes away, and the lust of it, but he who does the will of God abides forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'>Little children, it is the last time. And just as you have heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have risen up, from which we know that it is the last hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they were of us, they would have continued with us. But [they went out] so that it might be revealed that they were not all of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.20'>But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.21'>I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and know that no lie is of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.22'>Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He who denies the Father and the Son is antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'>Everyone who denies the Son neither has the Father. The [one] confessing the Son also has the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'>Therefore what you heard from the beginning, let it abide in you. If what you heard from [the] beginning remains in you, you will abide in both the Son and in the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.25'>And this is the promise that He has promised us: everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'>These [things] I have written to you concerning those leading you astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'>But the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as His anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true and no lie, and as He has taught you, abide in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.28'>And now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He is revealed, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him in His coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.29'>If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone who does righteousness has been born of Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.3'>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.1'>Behold what manner of love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God. Therefore the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.2'>Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be. But we know that when He shall be revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'>And everyone who has this hope on him purifies himself, even as that [One] is pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'>Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, for sin is lawlessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'>And you know that He was revealed that He might take away our sins, and in Him is no sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'>Everyone who abides in Him does not sin. Everyone who sins has not seen Him nor known Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.7'>Little children, let no one deceive you. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as that [One] is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>He who practices sin is of the Devil, for the Devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was revealed, that He might undo the works of the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>Everyone who has been born of God does not commit sin, because His seed remains in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the Devil: everyone not practicing righteousness is not of God, also he who does not love his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'>For this is the message that you have heard from [the] beginning, that we should love one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'>not as Cain [who] was of the evil one, and killed his brother. And for what did he kill him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's things were righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.13'>Do not marvel, my brothers, if the world hates you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers. He who does not love [his] brother abides in death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.15'>Everyone hating his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer has everlasting life abiding in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'>By this we have known the love [of God], because He laid down His life for us. And we ought to lay down [our] lives for the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'>But whoever has this world's goods and sees his brother having need, and shuts up his bowels from him, how does the love of God dwell in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'>My children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'>And in this we shall know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'>that if our heart accuses us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'>Beloved, if our heart does not accuse us, we have confidence toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'>And whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.23'>And this is His commandment, that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as He gave us commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.24'>And he who keeps His commandment dwells in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit which He gave to us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.4'>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.1'>Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but try the spirits to see if they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.2'>By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in [the] flesh is of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.3'>and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in [the] flesh is not of God. And this is the antichrist you heard is coming, and even now is already in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.4'>You are of God, little children, and you have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.5'>They are of the world, therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.6'>We are of God. He who knows God hears us. The one who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.7'>Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God, and everyone who loves has been born of God, and knows God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.8'>The one who does not love has not known God. For God is love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.9'>In this the love of God was revealed in us, because God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might live through Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.10'>In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son [to be] the propitiation concerning our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.11'>Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.12'>No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and His love is perfected in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.13'>By this we know that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.14'>And we have seen and testify that the Father sent the Son [to be] the Savior of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.15'>Whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him and he in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.16'>And we have known and believed the love that God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.17'>In this is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, that as He is, so also we are in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.18'>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has torment. He who fears has not been perfected in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.19'>We love Him because He first loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.20'>If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For if he does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.21'>And we have this commandment from Him, that he who loves God should love his brother also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.5'>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.1'>Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God. And everyone who loves Him who begets also loves him who has been born of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.2'>By this we know that we love the children of God, whenever we love God and keep His commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.3'>For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments, and His commandments are not burdensome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.4'>For everything that has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.5'>Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.6'>This is He who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ, not by water only, but by the water and blood. And the Spirit is He who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.7'>For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.8'>And there are three that bear witness on the earth:] the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the three are into the one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.9'>If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. For this is the witness of God which He has testified about His Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.10'>He who believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself. He who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he does not believe the record that God gave of His Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.11'>And this is the record, that God has given to us everlasting life, and this life is in His Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.12'>He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.13'>I have written these things to you who believe on the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have everlasting life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.14'>And this is the confidence that we have toward Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.15'>And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.16'>If anyone sees his brother sin a sin not to death, he shall ask, and He shall give him life for those that do not sin to death. There is a sin to death, I do not say that he shall pray for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.17'>All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.18'>We know that everyone who has been born of God does not continue to sin, but the one born of God guards himself, and the evil one does not touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.19'>We know that we are of God, and all the world lies in evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.20'>And we know that the Son of God has come, and [He] has given us an understanding so that we may know Him who is true. And we are in Him that is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and the everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.21'>Little children, guard yourselves from idols. Amen.</verse>
