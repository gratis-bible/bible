And the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if his hand cannot reach to a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass which he has committed, two turtle-doves or two young pigeons to the LORD-- one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer for the sin offering first, and shall wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood shall be drained at the bottom of the altar. It [is] a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the ordinance. And the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if he is not able to bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering. He shall put no oil on it, neither shall he put frankincense on it. For it [is] a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his full handful of it, a memorial of it, and burn [it] on the altar, on the fire offering to the LORD. It is a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin that he has sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him. And [the rest] shall be the priest's, as a food offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a soul commits a trespass and sins through ignorance in the holy things of the LORD, then he shall bring for his trespass to the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flock, together with an amount set by you, by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he shall make it good [in] which he has sinned, in the holy thing, and he shall add the fifth part of it, and give it to the priest. And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if a soul sins, and he has done that which ought not to be done, any one from all the commands of the LORD, and does not know, and he is guilty and bears his iniquity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>then he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, at your evaluation, for a trespass offering, to the priest. And the priest shall make an atonement for him for his ignorance in which he erred without knowing it, and it shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It [is] a trespass offering.
