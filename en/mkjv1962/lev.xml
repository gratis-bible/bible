        <verse osisID='Lev.26.26'>When I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver [you] your bread again by weight. And you shall eat and not be satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.27'>And if you will not for all of this listen to Me, but will walk contrary to Me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.28'>then I will walk contrary to you also in fury. And I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.29'>And you shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters you shall eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.30'>And I will destroy your high places and cut down your images, and throw your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols, and My soul shall despise you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.31'>And I will make your cities waste and cause your sanctuaries to be deserted. And I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.32'>And I will turn the land into wasteland. And your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.33'>And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you. And your land shall be waste, and your cities waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.34'>Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lies waste, and [you are] in your enemies' land; then shall the land rest and enjoy its sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.35'>As long as it lies waste it shall rest, because it did not rest in your sabbaths when you lived on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.36'>And on those of you that are left I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. And the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee as if fleeing from a sword. And they shall fall when none pursues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.37'>And they shall fall on one another, as if it were before a sword, when none pursues. And you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.26.39'>And they that are left of you shall putrefy in their wilful sin in your enemies' lands. And also they shall putrefy with them in the perversities of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.40'>If they shall confess their wilfulness and the wilfulness of their fathers, with their sin which they sinned against Me, and that also they have walked contrary to Me--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.41'>I also have walked contrary to them and have brought them into the land of their enemies. If then their uncircumcised hearts are humbled, and they then pay for their iniquity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.42'>then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham I will remember. And I will remember the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.43'>The land also shall be forsaken by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lies waste without them. And they shall accept the punishment of their iniquities; because, even because they despised My judgments, and because their soul hated My statutes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.44'>And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I hate them, to destroy them utterly and to break My covenant with them. For I [am] the LORD their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.45'>But for their sakes, I will remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, so that I might be their God. I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.46'>These [are] the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord made between Him and the sons of Israel in Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lev.27'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.1'>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.2'>Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When a man shall make a special vow, the persons [shall be] for the LORD by your evaluation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.3'>And your judgment shall be of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your judgment shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.4'>And if it [is] a female, then your judgment shall be thirty shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.5'>And if from five years old to twenty years old, then your judgment shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.6'>And if from a month old to five years old, then your judgment shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female your judgment [shall be] three shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.7'>And if from sixty years old and above, if it is a male then your judgment shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.8'>But if he is poorer than your judgment, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him. The priest shall value him according to the ability of him who vowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.9'>And if [it is] an animal of which they bring an offering to the LORD, all that one gives of such to the LORD shall be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.10'>He shall not alter it nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. And if he shall at all change animal for animal, then it and the exchange of it shall be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.11'>And if [it is] any unclean animal, of which they do not offer a sacrifice to the LORD, then he shall present the animal before the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.12'>And the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad. As you the priest value it, so shall it be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.13'>But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth [part] of it to what you judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.14'>And when a man shall sanctify his house [to be] holy to the LORD, then the priest shall judge it, whether it is good or bad. As the priest shall judge it, so shall it stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.15'>And if he who sanctified it desires to redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth [part] of the silver of your judgment, and it shall be his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.16'>And if a man shall sanctify to the LORD [some part] of a field that he owns, then your judgment shall be according to its seed; a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.17'>If he sanctifies his field from the year of jubilee, according to your judgment it shall stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.18'>But if he sanctifies his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the silver according to the years that remain, even until the year of jubilee, and it shall be taken from your estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.19'>And if he who sanctified the field desires in any way to redeem it, then he shall add the fifth [part] of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be made sure to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.20'>And if he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.21'>But the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field devoted. The possession of it shall be the priest's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.22'>And if [a man] sanctifies to the LORD a field which he has bought, which [is] not of the fields he owns,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.23'>then the priest shall count to him the worth of your estimation, until the year of jubilee. And he shall give your estimation in that day, a holy thing to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.24'>In the year of the jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, to him who owns [it in] the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.25'>And all your judgments shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary, twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.26'>However, the first-born of an animal, which should be the LORD's first-born, no man shall sanctify it, whether an ox, or sheep, it is the LORD's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.27'>And if [it is] of an unclean animal, then he shall redeem it according to your estimation, and shall add a fifth [part] of it to it. Or if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.28'>However, no devoted thing that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, either of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed. Every devoted thing [is] most holy to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.29'>Nothing devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed, [but] shall surely be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.30'>And all the tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, [is] the LORD's. [It is] holy to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.31'>And if a man will at all redeem anything of his tithes, he shall add to it the fifth [part] of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.32'>And all the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, all that passes under the rod, a tenth shall be holy to the LORD</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.33'>He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it. And if he changes it at all, then both it and the change of it shall be holy. It shall not be redeemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.34'>These [are] the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the sons of Israel in Mount Sinai.</verse>
