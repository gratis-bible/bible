      <chapter osisID='Exod.1'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.1'>And these [were] the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt. Every man and his household came with Jacob:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.2'>Reuben; Simeon; Levi; and Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.3'>Issachar; Zebulun; and Benjamin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.4'>Dan; and Naphtali; Gad; and Asher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.5'>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls, for Joseph was [already] in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.6'>And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.7'>And the sons of Israel were fruitful, and increased very much, and multiplied, and became exceedingly mighty. And the land was filled [with] them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.8'>And there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.9'>And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the sons of Israel [are] many and mightier than we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.10'>Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it will be when there comes a war, they join also to our enemies, and fight against us, and get out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.11'>And they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built treasure cities for Pharaoh, Pithon and Raamses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.12'>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.13'>And the Egyptians made the sons of Israel serve with harshness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.14'>And they made their lives bitter with hard work in mortar and in bricks, and in all [kinds of] work in the field; all their work in which they made them do [was] with harshness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.15'>And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one [was] Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.16'>And he said, When you midwife the Hebrew women, and look on the birth stools, if it [is] a son, then you shall kill him. But if it [is] a daughter, then she shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.17'>But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved alive the male children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.18'>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, Why have you done this thing, and have saved the male children alive?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.19'>And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women [are] not like the Egyptian women. For they [are] lively, and are delivered before the midwives come in to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.20'>And God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied and became very mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.21'>And it happened, because the midwives feared God, [that] He made them houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.22'>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.2'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.1'>And a man went from the house of Levi and took a daughter of Levi [as his wife].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.2'>And the woman conceived and bore a son. And when she saw him, that he was beautiful, she hid him three months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.3'>But when she could no longer hide him, she took an ark of papyrus for him, and daubed it with bitumen and with pitch, and put the child in it. And she laid [it] in the reeds by the river's edge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.4'>And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.5'>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river. And her maidens walked along by the riverside. And when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her slave-girl to bring it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.6'>And she opened [it], and she saw the child. And behold, a boy wept. And she had pity on him, and said, This [is] one of the Hebrews' sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.7'>And his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call a woman, a nurse of the Hebrew women for you, that she may nurse the child for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.8'>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the girl went and called [the] child's mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.9'>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give your wages. And the woman took the child and nursed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.10'>And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses. And she said, Because I took him out of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.11'>And it happened in those days, when Moses was grown, he went out to his brothers and looked upon their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.12'>And he looked this way and that way, and when he did not see anyone, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.13'>And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together. And he said to the guilty one, Why do you strike your neighbor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.14'>And he said, Who made you as a man, a ruler and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.15'>And when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian. And [he] sat down by a well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.16'>And the priest of Midian [had] seven daughters. And they came and drew, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.17'>And the shepherds came and drove them away. But Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.18'>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, Why have you hurried to come today?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.19'>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew for us and watered the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.20'>And he said to his daughters, And where [is] he? Why then have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.21'>And Moses was content to live with the man. And he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.22'>And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom. For he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.23'>And it happened after many days the king of Egypt died. And the sons of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.24'>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.25'>And God looked upon the sons of Israel, and God knew [them].</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.3'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.1'>And Moses kept the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the back side of the desert. And he came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.2'>And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a thorn bush. And he looked. And behold! The thorn bush burned with fire! And the thorn bush [was] not burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.3'>And Moses said, I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the thorn bush is not burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.4'>And the LORD saw that he had turned aside to see. God called to him out of the midst of the thorn bush, and said, Moses! Moses! And he said, Here I [am].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.5'>And He said, Do not come near here. Put off your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you stand [is] holy ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.6'>And He said, I [am] the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.7'>And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of My people who [are] in Egypt; I have heard their cry because of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.8'>And I am coming down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, to bring them up out of that land, to a good land, a large land, to a land flowing [with] milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.9'>And now behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me. And I have also seen the oppression [with] which the Egyptians oppress them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.10'>And now go, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.11'>And Moses said to God, Who [am] I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.12'>And He said, I will be with you. And this [shall be] the sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God upon this mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.13'>And Moses said to God, Behold, [when] I come to the sons of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they shall say to me, What [is] His name? What shall I say to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.14'>And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM. And He said, So you shall say to the sons of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.15'>And God said to Moses again, You shall say this to the sons of Israel, Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This [is My name forever, and this [is] My title from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.16'>Go, and gather the elders of Israel and say to them, Jehovah the God of your fathers has appeared to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, I have surely visited you and [have seen what] is done to you in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.17'>And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.18'>And they shall listen to your voice. And you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt. And you shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has met with us. And now let us go, we beseech you, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.19'>And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.20'>And I will stretch out My hand and smite Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in the midst of it. And after that he will let you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.21'>And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. And it shall be that when you go, you shall not go empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.22'>But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her that stays in her house, jewels of silver and jewels of gold and clothing. And you shall put [them] upon your sons and upon your daughters. And you shall plunder the Egyptians.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.4'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.1'>And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me nor listen to my voice. For they will say, The LORD has not appeared to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.2'>And the LORD said to him, What [is] this in your hand? And he said, A staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.3'>And He said, Throw it on the ground. And he threw it on the ground. And it became a serpent. And Moses ran from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.4'>And the LORD said to Moses, Put forth your hand and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand, --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.5'>so that they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.6'>And the LORD said to him again, Now put your hand in your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom. And when he took it out, behold, his hand [was] as leprous as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.7'>And He said, Put your hand into your bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again. And he brought it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again like his [other] flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.8'>And it will be, if they will not believe you, neither listen to the voice of the first sign, then they will believe the voice of the latter sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.9'>And also it will be, if they will not believe these two signs, neither listen to your voice, then you shall take from the water of the river and pour [it] upon the dry land. And the water which you take out of the river shall become blood on the dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.10'>And Moses said to the LORD, O my Lord, I [am] not a man of words now, nor since You have spoken to Your servant, but I [am] slow of speech and of a slow tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.11'>And the LORD said to him, Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? Have not I, the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.12'>And now go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.13'>And he said, O my Lord, I pray You, send by the hand [of him whom] You will send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.14'>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses. And He said, Do I not know Aaron the Levite, your brother that he can speak well? And also, behold, he comes forth to meet you. And when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.15'>And you shall speak to him, and you shall put words in his mouth. And I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.16'>And it will be, he shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be for a mouth to you. And you shall be to him a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.17'>And you shall take this rod in your hand, [with] which you shall do signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.18'>And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Please let me go and return to my brothers who [are] in Egypt and see if they [are] still alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.19'>And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, Go! Return to Egypt, for all the men who sought your life are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.20'>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.21'>And the LORD said to Moses, When you go to return into Egypt, see that you do all those wonders which I have put in your hand before Pharaoh; but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.22'>And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus says the Lord: Israel [is] My son, My first-born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.23'>And I say to you, Let My son go, that he may serve Me. And if you refuse to let him go, behold, I [am] going to kill your son, your first-born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.24'>And it happened by the way, in the inn, that the LORD met him and sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.25'>And Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and threw [it] at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband you [are] to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.26'>So He let him go. Then she said, [You are] a bloody husband, because of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.27'>And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.28'>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which He had commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.29'>And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.30'>And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.31'>And the people believed. And when they heard that the LORD had visited the sons of Israel, and that He had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed and worshiped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.5'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.1'>And afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah, God of Israel: Let My people go, that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.2'>And Pharaoh said, Who [is] Jehovah, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know Jehovah, neither will I let Israel go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.3'>And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go, we pray you, three days' journey into the desert and sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest He fall upon us with plague or with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.4'>And the king of Egypt said to them, Moses and Aaron, Why do you keep the people from their work? Get to your burdens!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.5'>And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now [are] many, and you make them rest from their burdens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.6'>And Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers the same day, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.7'>You shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.8'>And you shall lay upon them the number of bricks which they have made before now. You shall not take away from it. For they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go sacrifice to our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.9'>Let more work be laid upon the men, and let them labor in it. And do not let them regard vain words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.10'>And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out. And they spoke to the people, saying, So says Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.11'>Go and get straw where you can find it, yet not any of your work shall be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.12'>So the people were scattered through all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble for straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.13'>And the taskmasters hurried [them], saying, Finish your works, the thing of a day, just as when there was straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.14'>And the overseers of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten. [And they] demanded, Why have you not completed your task in making brick, both yesterday and today, as you did before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.15'>And the overseers of the sons of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why do you deal so with your servants?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.16'>There is no straw given to your servants, and they say to us, Make bricks! And behold, your servants [are] beaten, but the fault is in your own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.17'>But he said, You [are] idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, Let us go, let us sacrifice to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.18'>Therefore go now [and] work, for there shall be no straw given to you; yet you shall deliver the number of bricks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.19'>And the overseers of the sons of Israel saw themselves in affliction, after it was said, You shall not take away from your bricks of your daily task.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.20'>And they met Moses and Aaron standing in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.21'>And they said to them, The LORD look upon you and judge, because you have made our smell to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hands to kill us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.22'>And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Lord, why have You treated this people ill? Why then have you sent me?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.15.1'>Then the sons of Moses and Israel sang this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for He has triumphed gloriously; [the] horse and his rider He has thrown into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.2'>The LORD [is] my strength and song, and He has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will glorify Him, my father's God, and I will exalt Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.3'>The LORD [is] a Man of war; Jehovah [is] His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.4'>Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has thrown into the sea; his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.5'>The depths have covered them; they sank into the bottom like a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.6'>Your right hand, O LORD, has become glorious in power. Your right hand, O LORD, has dashed the enemy in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.7'>And in the greatness of Your excellency You have overthrown them that rose up against You. You sent forth Your wrath, consuming them like stubble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.8'>And with the blast of Your nostrils the waters were gathered together; the floods stood upright like a heap; the depths were curdled in the heart of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.9'>The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them, I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.10'>You blew with Your wind; the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.11'>Who [is] like You, O LORD, among the gods? Who [is] like You, glorious in holiness, fearful [in] praises, doing wonders?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.12'>You stretched out Your right hand, the earth swallowed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.13'>You in Your mercy have led forth the people [which] You have redeemed. You have guided them in Your strength to Your holy habitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.14'>The people shall hear, being afraid. Sorrow shall take hold on the people of Philistia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.15'>Then the princes of Edom [were] terrified. Trembling seized upon the mighty men of Moab. All the people of Canaan shall melt away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.16'>Fear and dread shall fall upon them. By the greatness of Your arm they shall be still as a stone, until Your people pass over, O LORD; until the people [whom] You have purchased pass over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.17'>You shall bring them and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance, the place, O LORD, You have made for You to dwell in; the Sanctuary, O LORD, [which] Your hands have established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.18'>The LORD shall reign forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.19'>For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them. But the sons of Israel went on dry land in the middle of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.20'>And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand. And all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.21'>And Miriam answered them, Sing to the LORD, for He has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider He has thrown into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.22'>And Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur. And they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.23'>And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, because it [was] bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Marah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.24'>And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.25'>And he cried to the LORD. And the LORD showed him a tree. And when he had cast it into the waters, the waters were made sweet. There He made a decree and a law for them, and there He tested them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.26'>And he said, If you will carefully listen to the voice of the LORD your God, and will do that which is right in His sight, and will give ear to His commandments, and keep all His laws, I will put none of these diseases upon you, which I have brought upon the Egyptians; for I [am] the LORD who heals you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.15.27'>And they came to Elim, where [there were] twelve wells of water, and seventy palm trees. And they camped there by the waters.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.16'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.1'>And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel came into the wilderness of Sin, which [is] between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month  after] their departing out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.2'>And the whole congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.3'>And the sons of Israel said to them, O that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we ate bread to the full! For you have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.4'>Then the LORD said to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from the heavens for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain amount every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.5'>And on the sixth day it shall happen, they shall prepare what they bring in. And it shall be twice as much as they gather day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.6'>And Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, At evening, then you shall know that the LORD has brought you out from the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.7'>And in the morning, then you shall see the glory of the LORD. For He hears your murmurings against the LORD. And what [are] we, that you murmur against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.8'>And Moses said, You will see when the LORD shall give you flesh to eat in the evening and bread to the full in the morning, when the LORD hears your murmurings which you murmur against Him. And what are we? Your murmurings [are] not against us, but against the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.9'>And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, Come near before the LORD. For He has heard your murmurings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.10'>And it happened as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, they turned toward the wilderness. And behold! The glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.11'>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.12'>I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel. Speak to them, saying, You shall eat flesh at evening, and in the morning you shall be filled [with] bread. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.13'>And it happened at evening, the quails came up and covered the camp. And in the morning the dew lay all around the host.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.14'>And when the layer of dew had gone up, behold, [there was] a small round thing upon the face of the wilderness, small as the hoar-frost upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.15'>And when the sons of Israel saw, they said each one to his brother, What [is] that? For they did not know what it [was]. And Moses said to them, This [is] the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.16'>This [is] the thing which the LORD has commanded: Each man gather of it according to his eating, an omer for a head, according to the number of your souls. Each one shall take for those who [are] in his camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.17'>And the sons of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, and some less.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.18'>And when they measured with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little lacked nothing. They gathered each one according to his eating.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.19'>And Moses said, Let no man leave of it until the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.20'>But they did not listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning. And it became rotten [with] maggots, and stank. And Moses was angry with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.21'>And they gathered it every morning, each man according to his eating. And when the sun became hot, it melted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.22'>And it happened, on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.23'>And he said to them, This [is that] which the LORD has said, Tomorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD. Bake what you will bake [today], and boil what you will boil. And that which remains over, lay up for you to be kept until the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.24'>And they laid it up until the morning, as Moses said. And it did not stink, neither was there any worm in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.25'>And Moses said, Eat that today. For today [is] a sabbath to the LORD. Today you shall not find it in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.26'>Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the sabbath, in it there shall be none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.27'>And it happened [some] of the people went out on the seventh day in order to gather. And they did not find [any].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.28'>And the LORD said to Moses, How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.29'>See, because the LORD has given you the sabbath, therefore He gives you the bread of two days on the sixth day. Each one stay in his place. Let not any one go out of his place on the seventh day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.30'>So the people rested on the seventh day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.31'>And the house of Israel called the name of it Manna. And it [was] like coriander seed, white. And the taste of it [was] like wafers with honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.32'>And Moses said, This [is] the thing which the LORD has commanded: Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations, so that you may see the bread with which I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.33'>And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot and put an omer full of manna in it, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.34'>As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.35'>And the sons of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to a land in which people lived. They ate manna until they came into the borders of the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.36'>And an omer [is] the tenth part of an ephah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.17'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.1'>And all the congregation of the sons of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the command of the Lord, and pitched in Rephidim. And [there was] no water for the people to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.2'>And the people wrangled with Moses and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why do you wrangle with me? Why do you tempt the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.3'>And the people thirsted there for water. And the people murmured against Moses and said, Why [is] this, [that] You brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our sons and our cattle with thirst?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.4'>And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, What shall I do to this people? They are almost ready to stone me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.5'>And the LORD said to Moses, Go on in front of the people, and take with you the elders of Israel. And take your rod with which you struck the river, in your hand, and go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.6'>Behold, I will stand before you there upon the rock in Horeb. And you shall smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, so that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.7'>And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the wrangling of the sons of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.8'>Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.9'>And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out to fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.10'>And Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.11'>And it happened when Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed. And when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.12'>But Moses' hands [became] heavy. And they took a stone and put [it] under him, and he sat on it. And Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. And his hands were steady until the going of the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.13'>And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people by the mouth of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.14'>And the LORD said to Moses, Write this, a memorial in a book, and set [it] in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.15'>And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah My Banner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.17.16'>And he said, A hand [is] on the throne of the LORD; war is to the LORD with Amalek from generation to generation.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Exod.18'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.1'>When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.2'>then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.3'>and her two sons, of which the name of the one [was] Gershom (for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.4'>and the name of the other [was] Eliezer (for the God of my father, my help, delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.5'>And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness, where he camped at the mount of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.6'>And he said to Moses, I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come to you, and your wife and her two sons with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.7'>And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed down to him, and kissed him. And they asked each other of [their] welfare. And they came into the tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.8'>And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and [how] the LORD delivered them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.9'>And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.10'>And Jethro said, Blessed [be] the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.11'>Now I know that Jehovah [is] greater than all gods; for in the thing in which they were proved against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.12'>And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. And Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.13'>And on the next day it happened that Moses sat to judge the people. And the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.14'>And when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What [is] this thing which you do to the people? Why do you sit alone by yourself, and all the people stand by you from morning to evening?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.15'>And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.16'>When they have a matter, they come to me. And I judge between one and another, and I make known the statutes of God and His laws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.17'>And Moses' father-in-law said to him, The thing that you do [is] not good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.18'>You will surely wear away, both you and this people that [is] with you. For this thing [is] too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.19'>Listen now to my voice; I will give you counsel, and God will be with you. You be for the people toward God, that you may bring the causes to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.20'>And you shall teach them ordinances and laws, and shall make them know the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.21'>And you shall look out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness. And place [such] over them to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.22'>And let them judge the people at all times. And it shall be, every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge. And make it easier for yourself, and they shall bear with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.23'>If you will do this thing, and God command you, then you shall be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.24'>And Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.25'>And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.26'>And they judged the people at all times. The hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.18.27'>And Moses let his father-in-law depart. And he went his way into his own land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.19.1'>In the third month when the sons of Israel had gone forth out of the land of Egypt, on this day they came [to] the wilderness of Sinai.</verse>
