But the word [preached] did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For we who have believed do enter into the rest, as He said, I have sworn in My wrath that they should not enter into My rest; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For He spoke in a certain place of the seventh [day] in this way: And God rested the seventh day from all His works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And in this place again, They shall not enter into My rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Since then it remains that some must enter into it, and since they to whom it was first preached did not enter in because of unbelief,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He again marks out a certain day, saying in David, Today, (after so long a time). Even as it is said, Today, if you will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So then there remains a rest to the people of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he who has entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God [did] from His.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore let us labor to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of unbelief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the word of God [is] living and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to [the] dividing apart of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in His sight, but all things [are] naked and opened to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Since then we have a great High Priest who has passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our] profession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we do not have a high priest who cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted just as [we are, yet] without sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
