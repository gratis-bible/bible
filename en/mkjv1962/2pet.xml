      <chapter osisID='2Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.1'>Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained like precious faith with us through [the] righteousness of our God and our Savior Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.2'>Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.3'>according as His divine power has given to us all things that [pertain] to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who has called us to glory and virtue,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.4'>through which He has given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, so that by these you might be partakers of [the] divine nature, having escaped the corruption [that is] in [the] world through lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.5'>But also in this very thing, bringing in all diligence, filling out your faith with virtue, and with virtue, knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.6'>and with] knowledge self-control, and [with] self-control, patience, and [with] patience, godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.7'>and [with] godliness, brotherly kindness, and [with] brotherly kindness, love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.8'>For if these things are in you and abound, they make you to be] neither idle nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.9'>For he] in whom these things are not present is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his sins in the past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.10'>Therefore, brothers, rather be diligent to make your calling and election sure, for [if you] do these things, you shall never fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.11'>For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.12'>Therefore I will not neglect to put you always in remembrance of these things, though [you] know [them] and are established in the present truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.13'>But I think [it] right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by a reminder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.14'>knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle is soon, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.15'>And I will also be diligent to cause you to always have memory of these things after my departure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.16'>For not having followed fables having been cunningly devised, but becoming eyewitnesses of the majesty of Jesus Christ, we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.17'>For He received honor and glory from God [the] Father, when was borne to Him a voice from the excellent glory, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.18'>And we heard this voice being borne from Heaven, being with Him in the holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.19'>We also have a more sure word of prophecy, to which you do well to take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the Daystar arises in your hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.20'>knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture came into being of [its] own private interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.21'>For prophecy was not borne at any time by [the] will of man, but holy men of God spoke being borne along by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.1'>But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who secretly will bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.2'>And many will follow their pernicious ways, and because of them the way of truth will be evil spoken of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.3'>And through covetousness they will use you for gain with well-turned words; for whom judgment from of old does not linger, and their destruction does not sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.4'>For if God did not spare sinning angels, but thrust [them] down into Tartarus, and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, being reserved to judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'>And He did not spare [the] old world, but saved Noah [the] eighth one, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.6'>And turning the cities [of] Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, He condemned [them] with an overthrow, setting an example to men] intending to live ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.7'>And He delivered righteous Lot, oppressed with the lustful behavior of the lawless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'>For that righteous one living among them, in seeing and hearing, [his] righteous soul [was] tormented from day to day with [their] unlawful deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>[The] Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reserve the unjust for a day of judgment, to be punished,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.10'>and especially those who walk after the flesh in [the] lust of uncleanness, and despise dominion. They are darers, self-pleasing; not trembling [at] glories, speaking evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'>Where angels, [who are] greater in power and might, do not bring a reproaching accusation against them before [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'>But these, as unreasoning natural brute animals having been born for capture and corruption, speak evil of the things that they do not understand. And they will utterly perish in their own corruption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'>being about to receive [the] wages of unrighteousness, deeming indulgence [as] pleasure in [the] daytime, and reveling [in] spots and blemishes, feasting along with you in their deceits,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'>having eyes full of adultery and never ceasing from sin, alluring unstable souls, having a heart exercised [with] covetousness. [They are] cursed children</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'>who have forsaken the right way and have gone astray, following the way of Balaam [the son] of Beor, who loved [the] wages of unrighteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'>but had reproof of [his] lawbreaking, a dumb ass speaking in a man's voice, held back the madness of the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'>These are wells without water, clouds driven with a tempest, for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'>For when they speak great swelling [words] of vanity, they lure through [the] lusts of the flesh, by unbridled lust, the ones who were escaping from those who live in error;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'>promising them liberty, they themselves are the slaves of corruption. For by whom anyone has been overcome, even to this one he has been enslaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'>For if [they] have escaped the pollutions of the world through the full knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and are again entangled, they have been overcome by these, [their] last things are worse [than] the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'>For it would have been better for them not to have fully known the way of righteousness, than fully knowing [it], to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'>But [the] word of the true proverb has happened to them: [The] dog turning to [his] own vomit; and, [The] washed sow to wallowing in the mire.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'>Beloved, I now write this second letter to you, in which I stir up your pure mind by reminder</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'>to remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of the Lord and Savior by us, the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'>First, knowing this, that there will come in [the] last days scoffers walking according to their own lusts</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'>and saying, Where is the promise of His coming? For since [the] fathers fell asleep, all things continue as [they were] from the beginning of creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'>For this is hidden from them [by their] willing it, that the heavens were of old, and the earth out of the water, and through water, being held together by the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>through which the world that then was, being flooded by water, perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>But the present heavens and the earth being kept in store by the same word, are being kept for fire until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>But, beloved, let not this one thing be hidden [from you], that one day [is] with [the] Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>The Lord is not slow concerning His promise, as some count slowness, but is long-suffering toward us, not purposing that any [of us] should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in [the] night, in which the heavens will pass away with a rushing noise, and [the] elements will melt with fervent heat. And the earth and the works in it will be burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>Then, all these things being [about to be] dissolved, what sort ought you to be in holy behavior and godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'>looking for and rushing the coming of the Day of God, on account of which [the] heavens, being on fire, will melt away, and [the] elements will melt, burning with heat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>But according to His promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>Therefore, beloved, looking for these things, be diligent, spotless, and without blemish, to be found by Him in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>And think of the long-suffering of our Lord [as] salvation (as our beloved brother Paul also has written to you according to the wisdom given to him</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable pervert, as also [they do] the rest of the Scriptures, to [their] own destruction).</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>Therefore, beloved, knowing beforehand, beware lest being led away with the error of the lawless, you fall from [your] own steadfastness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>But grow in grace and [in] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him [be] the glory, both now and to [the] day of eternity. Amen.</verse>
