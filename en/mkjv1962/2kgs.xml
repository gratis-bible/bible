      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.1'>And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.2'>And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper room in Samaria, and was sick. And [he] sent messengers and said to them, Go, ask of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.3'>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise! Go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say to them, [Is it] not because no God is in Israel [that] you go to ask of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.4'>And therefore so says the LORD, You shall not come from that bed on which you have gone up, but shall surely die. And Elijah left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.5'>And the messengers turned back to him. And he said, Why have you now turned back?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.6'>And they said to him, A man came up to meet us and said to us, Go, turn again to the king who sent you, and say to him, So says the LORD, [Is it] not because no God [is] in Israel [that you go to ask of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? Therefore, you shall not come down from that bed on which you have gone up, but shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.7'>And he said to them, What kind of man [was he] who came up to meet you and told you these words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.8'>And they answered him, [He was] a hairy man and was bound with a girdle of leather around his loins. And he said, He [is] Elijah the Tishbite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.9'>And he sent to him a commander of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him. And, behold, he sat on the top of a hill. And he spoke to him, Man of God! The king has said, Come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.10'>And Elijah answered and said to the commander of fifty, If I [am] a man of God, then let fire come down from the heavens and burn up you and your fifty. And there came down fire from the heavens and burned up him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.11'>And he turned and he sent to him another commander of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, Man of God! So says the king, Come down quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.12'>And Elijah answered and said to him, If I [am] a man of God, let fire come down from the heavens and burn up you and your fifty. And the fire of God came down from the heavens and burned up him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.13'>And he turned and sent again a third commander of fifty and his fifty. And the third commander of fifty came up and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, Man of God, Please let my life and the life of these fifty, your servants, be precious in your sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.14'>Behold, fire has come down from the heavens and burned up the two commanders of the former fifties with their fifties. And now let my life be precious in your sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.15'>And the Angel of the LORD said to Elijah, Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him. And he arose and went down with him to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.16'>And [he] said to him, So says the LORD, Because you have sent messengers to ask of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, [Is it] not because no God [is] in Israel to seek His word? Therefore you shall not come down off that bed on which you have gone up, but shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.17'>And he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his place, in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, because he had no son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.18'>And the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, [are] they not written in the Matters of the Days of the Kings of Israel?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.1'>And it happened when the LORD was to take Elijah up into Heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.2'>And Elijah said to Elisha, Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said, [As] the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they went down to Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.3'>And the sons of the prophets at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from your head today? And he said, Yes, I know. Keep silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.4'>And Elijah said to him, Elisha, please stay here. For the LORD has sent me to Jericho. And he said, [As] the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.5'>And the sons of the prophets at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him, Do you know that the LORD will take your master away from your head today? And he answered, Yes, I know. Keep silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.6'>And Elijah said to him, Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me to Jordan. And he said, [As] the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And the two of them went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.7'>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went on and stood afar off across [from them]. And both of them stood by the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.8'>And Elijah took his mantle and rolled [it] up, and struck the waters. And they were divided here and there, so that both of them crossed over on dry ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.9'>And it happened when they had gone over, Elijah said to Elisha. Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken away from you. And Elisha said, please, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.10'>And he said, You have asked a hard thing, [but] if you see me taken from you, it shall be so to you; but if not, it shall not be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.11'>And it happened as they went on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire [came], and they separated between them both. And Elijah went up in a tempest into Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.12'>And Elisha saw, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen! And he saw him no more. And he took hold of his clothes and tore them in two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.13'>He also took up the mantle of Elijah which had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.14'>And he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the waters, and said, Where [is] Jehovah God of Elijah, even He? And he also hit the waters, and they parted here and there. And Elisha went over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.15'>And when the sons of the prophets across in Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha! And they came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.16'>And [they] said to him, Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master, lest the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, You shall not send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.17'>And they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, Send. And they sent fifty men. And they looked for three days, but did not find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.18'>And they returned to him, And he was staying in Jericho. And he said to them, Did I not say to you, Do not go?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.19'>And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, please, the location of this city [is] pleasant, as my lord sees. But the waters [are] bad, and the ground [is] barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.20'>And he said, Bring me a new jar and put salt in it. And they brought to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.21'>And he went forth to the spring of the waters and threw the salt in there, and said, So says the LORD, I have healed these waters. There shall not be any more death or barrenness from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.22'>And the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.23'>And he went up from there to Bethel. And he was going up in the highway. And little boys came out from the city and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, bald head! Go up, bald head!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.24'>And he turned behind him and saw them, and declared them vile in the name of the LORD. And two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two boys of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.25'>And he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.1'>And Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.2'>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, but not like his father and his mother; for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.3'>But he clung to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. He did not depart from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.4'>And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and paid to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams with the wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.5'>And it happened when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.6'>And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at the same time and numbered all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.7'>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up. I [am] as you  are], my people as your people, my horses as your horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.8'>And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.9'>And the king of Israel and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom went. And they went around behind for seven days' journey. And there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.10'>And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.11'>And Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may ask of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.12'>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. And the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.13'>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What do I have to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother. And the king of Israel said to him, No, for the LORD has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.14'>And Elisha said, [As] the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely if it were not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you nor see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.15'>And now bring me a minstrel. And it happened when the minstrel played, the hand of the LORD came on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.16'>And he said, So says the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.17'>For so says the LORD, You shall not see wind, nor shall you see rain. Still that valley shall be filled [with] water, so that you may drink, both you and your cattle, and your animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.18'>And this is a light thing in the sight of the LORD. He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.19'>And you shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city. And you shall cut down every good tree and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece [of land] with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.20'>And it happened in the morning when the food offering was offered, behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.21'>And all Moab had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on [armor], and upward, and stood in the border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.22'>And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side red [like] blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.23'>And they said, This [is] blood. The kings are surely slain, and they have stricken one another. And now, Moab, to the spoil!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.24'>And they came to the camp of Israel, and the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them. But they [entered it and] struck Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.25'>And they beat down the cities, and each man cast his stone on every good piece [of land], and filled it. And they stopped all the wells of water, and cut down all the good trees. Only in Kir-haraseth did they leave the stones of it. But the slingers surrounded it and struck it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.26'>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too strong for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords, in order to break through to the king of Edom. And they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.27'>And he took his oldest son, who would have reigned in his place, and offered him [for] a burnt offering on the wall. And there was great anger against Israel. And they left him, and returned to the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.1'>And a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead. And you know that your servant feared the LORD. And the lender has come to take my two children to himself for slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.2'>And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house? And she said, Your handmaid has not a thing in the house except a pot of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.3'>And he said, Go, borrow vessels for yourself from outside, from your neighbors, empty vessels. Do not let [them] be few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.4'>And you shall go in and shut the door on you and your sons. And you shall pour out into all those vessels. And you shall set aside the full ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.5'>And she went from him and shut the door on her and on her sons. They brought to her, and she poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.6'>And it happened when the vessels were full, she said to her son, Bring me another vessel. And he said to her, [There is] not a vessel left. And the oil stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.7'>And she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil and pay your debt, and you and your sons shall live from the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.8'>And the day came when Elisha passed over to Shunem. And a great woman [was] there. And she laid hold on him to eat bread. And it happened, as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.9'>And she said to her husband, Behold now, I see that this [is] a holy man of God who passes by us continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.10'>Please, let us make a little room on the wall. And let us set a bed for him there, and a table, and a stool, and a lampstand. And when he comes to us, he shall turn in there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.11'>And the day came when he came in there, and he turned into the room and lay there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.12'>And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And he called her, and she stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.13'>And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, you have been thoughtful for us with all this care. What [is] to be done for you? Would you be spoken for to the king or to the commander of the army? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.14'>And he said, What then [is] to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Truly, she has no child, and her husband is old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.15'>And he said, Call her! And he called her, and she stood in the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.16'>And he said, At this time, according to the time of life, you shall embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, O man of God, do not lie to your handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.17'>And the woman conceived and bore a son at that time that Elisha had said to her, according to the time of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.18'>And the boy grew, and the day came that he went out to his father to the reapers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.19'>And he said to his father, My head, my head! And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.20'>And he carried him and brought him to his mother And he sat on her knees until noon and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.21'>And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut [the door] on him and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.22'>And [she] called to her husband and said, Please send me one of the young men and one of the asses so that I may run to the man of God and come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.23'>And he said, Why will you go to him today? [It is] neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, [It is] well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.24'>And she saddled an ass and said to her servant, Drive and go forward! Do not hold back [your] riding for me unless I tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.25'>And she went and came to the man of God, to Mount Carmel. And it happened when the man of God saw her afar off, he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, the Shunammite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.26'>Please run now to meet her, and say to her, [Is it] well with you? [Is it] well with your husband? [Is it] well with the boy? And she answered, Well!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.27'>And she came to the man of God to the hill, and she caught him by the feet. And Gehazi came near to push her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone, for her soul [is] troubled within her. And the LORD has hidden [it] from me and has not told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.28'>And she said, Did I desire a son from my lord? Did I not say, Do not deceive me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.29'>Then he said to Gehazi, Bind up your loins and take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet any man, do not greet him. And if any greet you, do not answer him again. And lay my staff on the face of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.30'>And the mother of the child said, [As] the LORD lives, and [as] your soul lives, I will not leave you. And he arose and followed her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.31'>And Gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff on the face of the child. But there [was] no voice nor hearing. And he turned back to meet him and told him, saying, The boy has not awakened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.32'>And Elisha had come to the house. And behold, the boy was dead, and laid out on his bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.33'>And he went in and shut the door on the two of them, and prayed to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.34'>And he went up and lay on the boy, and put his mouth on his mouth and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. And he stretched himself on the boy. And the flesh of the boy became warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.35'>And he returned and walked in the house to and fro. And [he] went up and stretched himself on him. And the boy sneezed seven times, and the boy opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.36'>And he called Gehazi and said, Call this Shunammite. And he called her, and she came in to him. And he said, Take up your son!</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.38'>And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And [there was] a famine in the land. And the sons of the prophets [were] sitting before him. And he said to his servant, Set on the great pot and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.</verse>
