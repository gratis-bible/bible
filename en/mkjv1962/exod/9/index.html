And there shall nothing die of all [that belongs] to the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the LORD did that thing on the next day, and all the cattle of Egypt died. But of the cattle of the sons of Israel, not one died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, Take to yourselves handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth [with] sores upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they took ashes of the furnace and stood before Pharaoh. And Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky, and it became a boil breaking forth [with] sores upon man and upon beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the priests could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boil was upon the priests and upon all the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, even as the LORD had spoken to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, So says the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let My people go, so that they may serve Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For I [am] going to send at this time all My plagues upon your heart, and upon your servants, and upon your people, so that you may know that [there is] none like Me in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For now I will stretch out My hand, that I may strike you and your people with plagues, and you shall be cut off from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And for this I have made you stand, to make you see My power, to declare My name in all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do you still exalt yourself against My people, that you will not let them go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold! Tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, [such as] has not been in Egypt since the foundation of it even until now!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And now send out, gather your cattle, and all that you have in the field. Upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle to flee into the houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he that did not regard the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch forth your hand toward heaven, so that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heavens. And the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire came down to the ground. And the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And [there] was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that [was] in the field, both man and beast. And the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel [were], was there no hail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned [this] time. Jehovah [is] righteous, and I and my people are wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Pray to the LORD, [for it is] enough. Let there be no mighty thunderings and hail. And I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said to him, as soon as I go out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the LORD. The thunder shall stop, and the hail will not be any more, so that you may know that the earth is the LORD's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But [as for] you and your servants, I know that you will not yet fear the LORD God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the flax and the barley [were] stricken, for the barley was in the head, and the flax was in bud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But the wheat and the rye were not stricken, for they had not grown up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD. And the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, he sinned still more and hardened his heart, he and his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the sons of Israel go, even as the LORD had spoken by Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
