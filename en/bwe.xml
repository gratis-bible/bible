        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>Here are the names of the people in the family line from which Jesus Christ came. He came from Davids family. He came from Abrahams family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Jesus family line: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Perez (his mother was Tamar), Zezron,  Ram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmon, Boaz (his mother was Rahab), Obed (his mother was Ruth), Jesse, David the king, Solomon (whose mother was Uriahs wife), Rehoboam,  Abijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Joram, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon,  Josiah, Jeconiah and his brothers (at the time the people of Israel were carried away to Babylon), Shealtiel, Zerubbabel, Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Zadok, Achim, Eliud, Eleazor,  Matthan, Jacob and Joseph who was the husband of Mary. Mary was the mother of Jesus, who is called the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>There were fourteen families from Abraham to David. There were fourteen families from David to the time the people were taken to Babylon. And there were fourteen families after that until Christ was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>This is the way Jesus Christ was born. Mary, his mother, was promised to Joseph to be his wife. But before they were married, she found out that she was going to have a baby.  It was by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Joseph, the man she was to marry, was a good man. He did not want her to be made ashamed. So he planned to leave her without telling people about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>While he was thinking about this, he had a dream. An angel of the Lord came to him. He said, Joseph, Davids son, do not fear to take Mary to be your wife. Her baby is by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>She will have a baby son. Name him Jesus, because he will save his people from the wrong things they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>All of this had been told long before by the Lord through his prophet. It came true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>The prophet said, A young woman who has not slept with a man is going to have a baby son. His name will be Emmanuel. That means "God is with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>Joseph woke up and did what the angel of the Lord told him to do. He took Mary to be his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>But he did not make love with her until her first son had been born. He named him Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem, in the country of Judea. Herod was the king.  After Jesus was born, wise men came from the east to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>They asked, Where is the child who has been born to be King of the Jews? We saw his star rising and we have come to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When King Herod heard this, he was very troubled. All the people in Jerusalem were troubled also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>He called all the chief priests and the scribes of the Jews for a meeting. He asked them,  Where is the Christ to be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>They told him, In Bethlehem in Judea. That is what the prophet, the man of God long ago, wrote:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>"Bethlehem in the country of Judah, you are not the least among the leaders in Judah. A leader will come from you who will rule over my people Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod called the wise men to talk with them secretly. He found out from them what time they saw the star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>He sent them to Bethlehem. He said, Go and ask everywhere until you find the child.  When you have found him, come and tell me, so that I myself may go and worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>After they heard what the king said, they went away. And the star, which they had seen rising, went in front of them. It stopped above the place where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>When they saw the star, they were very glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>They went into the house, and there they saw the child and Mary his mother. They kneeled down and worshipped him. Then they opened their bags and gave him gifts.  These gifts were gold, and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>In a dream they were told not to go back to Herod. So they went home by a different road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>After the wise men had gone, Joseph had a dream. An angel of the Lord came to him and said, Get up. Take the child and his mother, and go quickly to the country of Egypt. Stay there till I tell you, because Herod will try to find the child and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>Joseph woke up. He took the child and his mother in the night and went to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>He stayed there until Herod died. What the Lord told through his prophet long ago, came true. He said I called my son out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Herod saw that the wise men had fooled him. He was very angry. He sent men to kill all the baby boys in the town of Bethlehem and around it. They killed all the boys who were two years old or less. Herod remembered what the wise men had told him about the time they first saw the star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>So what the prophet Jeremiah said, came true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>He said, A voice could be heard in the town of Ramah. Rachel was crying for her children. She would not let anyone comfort her because her children were dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>Herod died. Then Joseph had a dream. An angel of the Lord came to him in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>The angel said, Get up. Take the child and his mother and go to the country of Israel.  The men who wanted to kill the child are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>Joseph woke up. He took the child and his mother and went to the country of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea in his father Herods place. So he was afraid to go there. In a dream he was told what to do. He went to the country of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>He went and made his home in the town of Nazareth. The prophets of God long ago had said, He shall be called a man from Nazareth. What they said came true.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>After some years had passed, John the Baptizer came and told Gods word in the desert of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>He said, Stop doing wrong things and turn back to God! The kingdom of heaven is almost here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>This is the man that Isaiah the prophet of God spoke about long ago. He said, A man is calling in the wilderness, "Make the way ready for the Lord. Make the road straight for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>John wore clothes made of camels hair and a leather belt. He ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>People went to him from Jerusalem, from all of Judea, and from all the country near the Jordan River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>He baptised them in the Jordan River when they said how sorry they were for the wrong things they had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>Many of the Pharisee group and the Sadducee group came to him to be baptised. But when he saw them, he said to them, You family of snakes! Who told you to run away from Gods anger that is coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Stop your wrong ways to show that you have turned back to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>Do not think you can say to your-selves, "Abraham is our father." I tell you, God can make children for Abraham from these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>The axe is ready to cut down the trees. Every tree that does not have good fruit is cut down and thrown into a fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I baptise you with water when you stop your wrong ways. But another person is coming after me. He is greater than I am. I am not good enough to take off his shoes. He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>He has a cleaning fan in his hand and will fan his grain very clean. He will put the grain into his storehouse. But he will burn the chaff in the fire that never dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He came to John to be baptised by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>John tried to stop him. He said, I need to be baptised by you. Why do you come to me to be baptised?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answered, Please do it now. In this way we shall do all that is right. Then John let him be baptised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>After Jesus was baptised, he came up out of the water right away. The sky opened. He saw the Spirit of God coming down on him like a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>A voice from the sky said, This is my dear Son. I am very pleased with him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then the Spirit led Jesus into the desert. The devil tried to make Jesus do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>Jesus did not eat anything for forty days and forty nights. Then he was very hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>The one who tries to make people do wrong came and said to him, If you are Gods Son,  tell these stones to be changed into bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But Jesus answered him, The holy writings say, "Man cannot live on bread only. He needs to live by every word that God says."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He put him on a high part of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>The devil said to him, If you are Gods Son, jump down. The holy writings say, "God will tell his angels to take care of you. They will hold you up in their hands so that you will not knock your foot on a stone."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus answered him, The holy writings say, "You must not test the Lord your God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>The devil took Jesus to a very high hill. He showed him all the countries of the world and how great they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>He said to Jesus, I will give you all these if you kneel down and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>But Jesus answered him, Get away, Satan. The holy writings say, "You must worship the Lord your God. and he is the only one you are to worship."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and took care of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Jesus heard that John was put in prison, so he went to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>He left the town of Nazareth and went to live in the town of Capernaum. It is by the sea (of Galilee) in the district of Zebulun and Naphtali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>So what the prophet Isaiah said came true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>He talked about, The country of Zebulun and the country of Naphtali, the road by the sea, the land on the other side of the Jordan River, Galilee where the people are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>And he said, The people who lived in darkness have seen a great Light. Light has come to those who lived in a land covered by the dark shadow of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From then on, Jesus began to tell Gods word to the people. He said, Stop your wrong ways and turn back to God! The kingdom of heaven is here!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon who later was named Peter, and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a fishing net into the water. Their work was to catch fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>Jesus said to them, Come with me. The work I will give you will be to catch people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>Right away they left their nets and went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>Jesus went on from there and saw two other brothers, James and John. Their fathers name was Zebedee. They were in the boat with their father mending their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>Jesus called them. Right away they left the boat and their father and went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>Jesus went all around through Galilee. He taught people in their meeting houses and told them the good news about the kingdom of heaven. He healed all the sick and weak people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>The people in all the country of Syria heard about him. They brought all who were sick in any way, or had bad spirits in them, and those who could not walk or use their hands.  Jesus healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>Many people went with him. They came from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea,  and from the other side of the Jordan river.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>When Jesus saw the many people, he went up on a hill. He sat down and his disciples came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>He began to teach the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>He said, God makes happy those who know that they need him. The kingdom of heaven is for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>God makes happy those who are sad. They will have comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>God makes happy those who quietly trust him and do not try to get their own way. The world will belong to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>God makes happy those who are hungry and thirsty for what is right and good. They will be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>God makes happy those who are kind. He will be kind to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>God makes happy those who have clean hearts. They will see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>God makes happy those who make peace between people. They will be called Gods sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>God makes happy those who have trouble for doing what is right. The kingdom of heaven is for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>God makes you happy when people say wrong things about you, when they trouble you,  and when they say all kinds of lies about you. God makes you happy when it is for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Be happy and glad because God will be good to you in heaven. In the same way people troubled the prophets before your time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>You are like salt in the world. If salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again?  Salt that has no taste is good for nothing. The only thing to do is to throw it out on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are like light in the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>So also with a lamp. People do not light a lamp and put it under a basket. But they put it on the place for a lamp. Then all the people in the house can see its light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>So, let your light shine to all people. Then they will see the good things you do. And they will praise your Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Do not think that I have come to take away the law and the writings of the prophets. No,  I have not come to take them away. But I have come to do what they say must be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>I tell you the truth. Until the sky and the earth are taken away, not one small part of the law will be taken away, until everything has been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>So anyone who does not obey one of the smallest laws, and teaches other people not to obey it, will have the smallest part in the kingdom of heaven. But any one who obeys and teaches the law, will have a big part in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>I tell you, you must do much better than the scribes and Pharisees. If you do not, then you will never go into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>You have heard this said to men long ago, "Do not kill. Anyone who kills will be judged in court."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I tell you this. Anyone who is angry with his brother without having a good reason,  will be judged in court. Anyone who says wrong things to his brother will be judged for it in the big court. Anyone who says "You fool!" will be judged to go into hell fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Perhaps you are bringing your gift to God at his altar. There you remember that your brother has something against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>If so, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First, go to your brother and make things right with him. Then come and give your gift to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>If someone wants to take you to court, make an agreement with him quickly on the way.  If you do not, he will take you to the judge. The judge will give you to the guard, and the guard will put you in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>I tell you the truth, you will not get out of prison until you have paid every piece of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>You have heard that the law says, "Do not commit adultery &lt;FI&gt;have another man or woman who is not your husband or wife&lt;Fi&gt; ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I tell you that if a man looks at a woman and he wants her, then he has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>If your right eye makes you do wrong, take it out and throw it away. It is better to lose a part of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>If your right hand makes you do wrong, cut it off and throw it away. It is better to lose a part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>The law said, "Any man who does not want to keep his wife must give her a paper to tell others she is no longer his wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I tell you, no man may send away his wife unless she has committed adultery. If he does send her away, he is making her commit adultery. And if a man marries a woman who has been sent away from her husband, he commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Also you have heard this said to men long ago, "You must not make a promise in Gods name and break it." And, "You must do for the Lord what you said you would do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I tell you, do not make a promise in Gods name. Do not use the name of heaven,  because that is where God rules.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>Do not use the name of earth, because that is where God rests his feet. Do not use the name of Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Do not make a promise by your head, because you cannot make one hair of your head white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>You must mean "Yes" when you say "Yes". You must mean "No" when you say "No".  To say anything more than that is wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>You have heard that the law says, "Take an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I tell you, do not fight with anyone who does wrong to you. But if someone hits you on one side of your face, turn the other side to him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>If anyone takes you to court to get your shirt, let him have your coat also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>If anyone wants you to help carry a load, go with him twice as far.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>When someone asks you for something, give it to him. When someone wants to borrow something from you, let him have it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>You have heard that the law says, "Love your neighbour and hate your enemy."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I tell you, love your enemies. Ask God to do good to those who trouble you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>In that way you will be sons of your Father in heaven. He makes his sun shine on both wrong and good people. He lets the rain fall on people who do right and on people who do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>If you love only those who love you, what reward will you get? Even the tax collectors do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>Do you speak to your brothers only? If so, you are not doing any better than other people. Even people who do not believe in God do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>You must be good in every way, as your Father in heaven is good in every way.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.6'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>Do not do good things so that people will see you do them. If you do, you will get no reward from your Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>So when you give money to poor people, do not send men in front of you to blow trumpets or horns. Some people do this in the meeting houses and on the streets so that people will praise them. They are not true to themselves. I tell you the truth. They have their pay already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But when you give money to poor people, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>In this way, what you give to the poor will be secret. Your Father sees secret things and he will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>When you talk to God, do not be like people who are not true to themselves. They like to stand and talk to God in the meeting houses and at the street corners, so that people will see them. I tell you the truth. They have their reward already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But when you talk to God, go into your room and shut the door. Then talk to your Father in secret. Your Father sees secret things and he will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>And when you talk to God, do not say words that mean nothing, over and over again.  People who do not believe in God do that. They think their god will hear them because they say many words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Do not be like them. Your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>So talk to your God like this: "Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>"May your kingdom come. May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>"Give us our food for today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.12'>"Forgive us for the wrong things we have done, the way we forgive those who have done wrong things to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.13'>"Do not test us but help us, so that no one will make us do wrong. Deliver us from the evil one. The kingdom and power and praise belong to you for ever. Amen!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.14'>If you forgive others for the wrong things they have done, then your Father in heaven will forgive you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.15'>But if you do not forgive others, your Father will not forgive you for the wrong things you have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>When you are fasting &lt;FI&gt;not eating food for a time&lt;Fi&gt; , do not look sad. That is what people do who are not true to themselves. They look sad to show people they are fasting. I tell you the truth. They have their reward already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.17'>But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face as you do at other times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.18'>Then people will not see that you are fasting. But your Father sees secret things, and he will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.19'>Do not keep many things for yourself on earth. Insects and rust will spoil them. People will get in and steal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.20'>But keep things for yourself in heaven. Insects and rust will not spoil them there. People will not get in and steal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.21'>The place where you keep things is where your heart will be also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.22'>The body gets its light through the eyes. If you have good eyes, all your body will have light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.23'>But if your eyes are bad, all your body will be in darkness. If the light in you is dark, it will be very dark for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.24'>No man can work for two masters. He will hate one and love the other. Or he will obey one and despise the other. You cannot work for both God and money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>So, I tell you this. Do not be troubled about what you will eat or drink to keep alive. Do not be troubled about what you will wear on your body. Life itself is worth more than food, and the body is worth more than clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.26'>Look at the birds that fly in the air. They do not plant or cut or keep any food. Yet your Father in heaven feeds them. Are you not worth more than birds?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.27'>Can any one of you live any longer by troubling yourself about these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.28'>And why are you troubled about clothes? See how the flowers grow in the fields. They do not work or make cloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.29'>I tell you, King Solomon was a great man. But he was not dressed as fine as one of these flowers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.30'>God dresses the grass in the fields so it looks nice. It is in the field one day and the next day it is put on the fire. If God dresses the grass like that, he cares much more that you have clothes to wear. You do not believe in God very much!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>So then, do not keep asking, "What shall we eat?" "What shall we drink?" and "What shall we wear?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.32'>It is the people who do not believe in God who work for all these things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.33'>Work first for Gods kingdom and what he calls good. Then you will have all these things also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>So do not be troubling yourself about tomorrow. Tomorrow will have its own trouble.  Todays trouble is enough for today.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.7.3'>Why do you look at the spot of dust in your brothers eye? But you do not see a big stick in your own eye!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.7.5'>You are not true to yourselves! First take the stick out of your own eye. Then you will be able to see to take the dust out of your brothers eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.6'>Do not give what is holy to dogs. Do not throw your fine stones to pigs. They will walk all over them, and then turn and hurt you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.7.11'>You are wrong, and yet you know how to give good things to your children. Much more,  your Father in heaven will give good things to those who ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.12'>Do to other people what you want them to do to you. That is what the law and the writings of the prophets say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.13'>Go in by the small gate. The gate is big and the road is wide that goes to death. Many people go that way.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.7.15'>Take care. There are prophets who are not true. They come to you dressed like sheep,  but inside they are like wolves, bad animals that kill sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.16'>You will know them by the things they do. People do not pick fruit like grapes from thistles. They do not pick fruit like figs from thorn trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.17'>In the same way, every good tree has good fruit. But a bad tree has bad fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.18'>A good tree cannot have bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot have good fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.19'>Every tree that does not have good fruit is cut down and thrown into a fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.7.21'>Some people say to me, "Lord, Lord". But not all who say that will go into the kingdom of heaven. Only those who do what my Father in heaven wants, will go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.22'>Many people will say to me on that day, "Lord, Lord, did we not speak in your name?  Did we not drive bad spirits out of people in your name? Did we not do big works in your name?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.23'>Then I will say to them, "I never knew you. Go away from me! What you do is very wrong!"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.8'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.1'>When Jesus came down from the hill, many people followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.2'>A man who had leprosy &lt;FI&gt;a bad skin disease&lt;Fi&gt; came and kneeled in front of Jesus and worshipped him. He said to Jesus, Sir, I know you can heal me if you want to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>Jesus put out his hand and touched him. He said, I want to. Be healed. Right away his leprosy was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>Jesus said to him, Do not tell anyone about this. But go and let the priest look at you.  Moses gave a law about the sacrifice you must give when you are healed. Give it, to prove to people you are healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>When Jesus came to the town of Capernaum, a Roman army officer came to ask him for help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>He said, Sir, one of my servants is in bed at my house. He cannot move and has much pain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>Jesus said, I will come and heal him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>The officer said, Sir, I am not good enough to have you come into my house. Just say the word and my servant will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>I myself am a man who takes orders, and I have soldiers who take orders from me. I say to one, "Go," and he goes. I say to another one, "Come," and he comes. I say to my servant, "Do this," and he does it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>Jesus was surprised when he heard this. He said to the people who followed him, I tell you the truth. I have not found any Jew who believes as this man does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>I tell you, many people will come from the east and from the west. They will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.12'>But those who were born in the kingdom will be put into the darkness outside. There they will cry and make noises with their teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>Jesus said to the officer, Go home. What you have believed, will be done. At that very same time the officers servant was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>Jesus went into Peters house. There he saw the mother of Peters wife in bed, sick with fever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>Jesus took hold of her hand and the fever left her. She got up and began to do things for Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>That evening, many people who had bad spirits were brought to Jesus. He spoke to the bad spirits and drove them out. And he healed all the people who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>What the prophet Isaiah said came true. He said, He took away the things that made us weak. He took away the things that made us sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>Jesus saw many people around him. So he said, Let us cross over to the other side of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>A scribe came and said to him, Teacher, I will go anywhere you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>Jesus said, Foxes have holes to live in. Birds have nests. But the Son of Man has no place to lie down to rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.21'>Another man who was a follower of Jesus, said to Jesus, Lord, let me go first and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.22'>But Jesus said to him, Come with me. Let those who are dead bury their own dead people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.23'>Jesus got in the boat and his disciples got in with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.24'>A bad storm came on the sea. The waves were high. Water came into the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.25'>The disciples came to Jesus and woke him. Lord, save us! they shouted. We will die!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>Jesus said to them, Why do you fear? You do not believe in God very much! Then Jesus got up. He said to the winds and the sea, Stop! Then all was quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>The disciples were surprised. They said What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>Jesus came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarene people. There were graves in that place. Two men came from among the graves to meet him. They had bad spirits in them. They were so bad and strong that people feared to pass that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>They shouted, Jesus, Son of God, what do you want to do to us? Have you come here to punish us before it is our time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>Many pigs were eating in a place far from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>The bad spirits begged Jesus, If you drive us out of these men, let us go into the pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>Jesus said, Go! The spirits came out of the men and went into the pigs. All the pigs ran fast down the steep hill into the sea. They died in the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>The men who cared for the pigs ran to the town. They told everything and what had happened to the men who had the bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>All the people in the town came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to go away out of their country</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.9'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.1'>Jesus got in the boat and crossed the sea. He came to his own town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.2'>Some men brought a sick man to him. The man could not move his arms or legs. He was lying on a bed. Jesus saw that they believed he would be healed. So he said to the sick man, My son, be glad! The wrong things you have done are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>Some of the scribes were thinking, This man is not giving respect to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, Why do you think these wrong things in your heart?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.5'>Which is easier, to say, "The wrong things you have done are forgiven," or to say, "Get up and walk"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.6'>I want you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive wrong things people have done. So he said to the sick man, Get up. Make up your bed and go home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>The man got up and went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>Many people saw this and were much surprised. They praised God who had given such power to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>Jesus went on from there. He saw a man named Matthew. He was sitting at the place where people came to pay taxes. Jesus said to him, Come with me. Matthew stood up and went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>Jesus was eating in a house. Many tax collectors and bad people came in. They sat down to eat with Jesus and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>The Pharisees saw this. They said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and bad people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>Jesus heard it. He said to them, People who are well do not need a doctor. But sick people need him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>Go and learn what this means: "I want you to be kind. I do not want a sacrifice." I did not come to call good people. I came to call bad people to stop doing wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>Then Johns disciples came to Jesus. They said, We and the Pharisees fast. Why do your disciples not do the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>Jesus answered, The people at a wedding cannot be sad while the man who is married is with them. But the time will come when he will be taken away from them. Then they will not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>No one sews a piece of new cloth on an old coat. If he does, the new cloth will tear the old coat. Then the hole is bigger than it was before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.17'>People do not put new wine into old wine skins. If they do, the old skins break. The wine is lost and the skins are spoiled. New wine is put into new skins. And so they are both saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.18'>While Jesus was telling them these things, a ruler came to him. He bowed down in front of Jesus to worship him and said, My daughter has just died. But if you will come and put your hand on her, she will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.19'>Jesus got up and went with the ruler. His disciples went too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>A woman had a sickness for twelve years. She was bleeding all the time. She came behind Jesus and touched his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.21'>She said to herself, If only I touch his clothes, I will be well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.22'>Jesus turned around. He saw her and said, Daughter, be glad. You were healed because you believed. And right away the woman was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.23'>When Jesus came to the rulers house, he saw the music players and people making a noise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.24'>He said to them, Go away. The girl is not dead, but sleeping. They laughed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.25'>The people were told to go outside. When they were out, he went in and took the girls hand. The girl got up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.26'>People in all that part of the country heard about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.27'>When Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him. They called out, Son of David, help us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.28'>When Jesus came into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus asked them, Do you believe that I can do this? They said, Yes, sir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.29'>Then Jesus touched their eyes. He said, As you believed, so will it happen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.30'>Then they were able to see. Jesus said to them, Take care, do not tell anyone about this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.31'>But they went away and told everybody in that part of the country about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>As they were leaving, people brought a man to Jesus. This man could not talk He had a bad spirit in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.33'>Jesus drove the bad spirit out of the man. Then he could talk. The people were very much surprised. They said, Nothing like this has ever been seen in the country of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.34'>But the Pharisees said, He drives bad spirits out of people by the power of the chief of bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.35'>Jesus went around to all the cities and towns. He taught people in their meeting houses and told them the good news of the kingdom of heaven. He healed all the sick and weak people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.36'>He saw the many people and was sorry for them. They were troubled and they could not help themselves. They were like sheep with no one to care for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.37'>Then Jesus said to his disciples, The harvest is much. But there are not many people to gather it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.38'>Talk to the Lord of this harvest, and ask him to send out people to his harvest.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.10'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.1'>Jesus called his twelve disciples to him. He gave them power over bad spirits so they could drive them out of people. He gave them power to heal people who were sick or weak in any way.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.11.9'>Why did you go out? To see a prophet of God? Yes, I tell you, and he is much more than a prophet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.1'>About that time, Jesus was walking through the grain fields on a Sabbath day. His disciples were hungry. They began to pick some of the grain and to eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.2'>The Pharisees saw them. They said to Jesus, Look! Your disciples are doing what is not right on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.3'>But Jesus said to them, Have you not read what David did? He and his men who were with him were hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.4'>He went into Gods house. Some bread was there for God. Davids men ate it. David did not have the right to eat it, nor the men who were with him. Only the priests have the right to eat it. But David took the bread and ate it. He also gave some of it to the men who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.5'>Have you never read in the books of the law that the priests in the temple break the Sabbath law on the Sabbath day? They are not punished for it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.7'>You do not know what this means, "I want you to be kind; I do not want a sacrifice." If you knew, then you would not have said what they did was wrong. What they did was not wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.8'>The Son of Man rules over the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.9'>Jesus left that place and went into the meeting house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.10'>There was a man whose hand was thin and weak. The people asked Jesus, Is it right to heal a man on the Sabbath day? They wanted to find something wrong about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.11'>Jesus said to them, If one of you had a sheep and it fell into a hole on the Sabbath day,  would you not take hold of it and pull it out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.12'>A man is worth much more than a sheep. So it is right to do good things on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.13'>Then he said to the man, Hold out your hand. The man held out his hand and it was made well like the other hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.14'>Then the Pharisees went out and planned together how to kill Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.15'>Jesus knew about their plan, so he went away from there. Many people followed him and he healed them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.16'>He told them not to tell where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.17'>So what Isaiah the prophet of God said, came true.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.24'>The Pharisees heard about it. They said, This man drives out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub, the chief of bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.25'>Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, If one part of any country fights against the other part of the country, that country is broken down. If one part of any city or family fights against the other part of it, it cannot stand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.39'>But Jesus answered them, The people today are bad. They have gone away from God.  They want a sign. No sign will be given them but the sign of the prophet Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.40'>Jonah was inside the big sea animal for three days and three nights. So the Son of Man will be in the ground for three days and three nights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.41'>When people are judged, the men of the city of Nineveh will stand up and speak against the people of today. The people of Nineveh stopped their wrong ways when Jonah told them Gods word. And the one who is here is greater than Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.42'>When people are judged, the Queen of the South will stand up and speak against the people of today. She came a long way to hear the wise talk of Solomon. And the one who is here is greater than Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.43'>When a bad spirit has gone out of a man, he goes through dry places. He looks for a place to rest, but he does not find any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.44'>Then he says, "I will go back to my house from where I came." When he comes back, he finds it is empty, clean, and all fixed up.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.3'>He taught the people many things by telling them stories. He said, Listen, a man went out to sow some seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.4'>As he sowed it, some of the seed fell on the road. Birds came and ate the seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.5'>Some seed fell on the stony ground. Not much earth covered the stones. The seed started to grow right away because it was not deep in the ground.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.7'>Some seed fell among the weeds. The weeds grew up and made the new plants die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.8'>But some seed fell on good ground. The seed grew and the plants gave more seed. Some plants gave thirty seeds. Some gave sixty. And some gave a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.9'>Everyone who has ears, listen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.10'>The disciples came to Jesus and asked him, Why do you tell the people these stories?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.11'>Jesus answered them, You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of heaven. But they cannot learn them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.12'>Anyone who already has something will get more, and he will have plenty. But he who does not have anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.13'>That is why I tell them stories. They look, but they do not see. They listen, but they do not hear or understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.14'>They make what Isaiah the prophet said long ago, come true. Isaiah said: "You will listen and listen, but you will not understand. You will look and look, but you will not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.15'>The hearts of these people have no feeling. They do not hear well with their ears. And they have shut their eyes. They do not want to see with their eyes. They do not want to hear with their ears. They do not want to understand in their hearts. They do not want to turn to me. If they did turn, I would heal them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.16'>God is blessing your eyes because they see. God is blessing your ears because they hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.17'>I tell you the truth. Many prophets and good men wanted to see what you see, but they did not see them. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they did not hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.18'>So listen to hear what the story means, about the man who sowed the seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.19'>People listen to the message about the kingdom of heaven. If anyone does not understand it, the devil comes along and takes the message out of his heart. That person is like the seed which fell on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.20'>Some seed fell on the stony ground. That is like a person who hears the message and right away he is glad to hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.21'>But it does not go down deep in his heart. He believes it for a short time. When trouble or a hard time comes because of the message, he stops believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.22'>Some seed fell among the weeds. That is like the person who hears the message. But he thinks about the things of this world. He wants to get money to be happy. These things push the message out of his heart. No good comes from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.23'>Some seed fell on good ground. That is like a person who hears the message and understands it. Much good comes from it. Some people are like the seed that gave a hundred more seeds. Some people are like the seed that gave sixty. Some people are like the seed that gave thirty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.24'>Jesus told the people another story. He said, The kingdom of heaven is like this. A man sowed good seed in his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.25'>While people were sleeping, a bad man came and sowed weeds among the good seed.  Then he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.26'>The good seed grew and the plants gave more seeds. Then the weeds grew too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.27'>The servants came and said to the man who owned the field, "Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How did the weeds get here?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.28'>He answered them, "A bad man has done this." They asked him, "Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.29'>"No," said the man. "If you pull up the weeds, then the good plants will come up with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.30'>Let them both grow together until the harvest time. When it is time to cut it, I will say to the men who cut it, Cut the weeds first. Tie them in bundles to be burned. Then put the grain into my storehouse."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.31'>Jesus told the people another story. He said, The kingdom of heaven is like this. A man took a mustard seed and planted it in his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.32'>A mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds. But the plant that grows from it is bigger than other plants. It is like a tree. It is so big that birds come and live in the branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.33'>Jesus told them another story. He said, The kingdom of heaven is like this. A woman took yeast and mixed it with many cups of flour. The yeast went all through the flour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.34'>Jesus told the people all these things in stories. He did not tell them anything without a story.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.35'>What the prophet of God said long ago, came true. He said, I will use stories. I will tell things that have been secret since the world was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.36'>Then Jesus left the people and went into the house. His disciples came to him. They said,  Tell us the meaning of the story about the weeds in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.37'>Jesus answered, The person who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.38'>The field is the world. The good seed means the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds mean those who belong to the bad one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.39'>The bad man who planted the weeds is the devil. The harvest time is the end of this world. The men who cut the harvest are angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.40'>The weeds are gathered and burned in a fire. That is the way it will be at the end of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.41'>The Son of Man will send his angels. They will gather everything that is bad and the people who do bad things. They will take them out of his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.42'>They will put them into the big fire. There they will cry and make a noise with their teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.43'>Then the people who are right with God will shine like the sun in their Fathers kingdom.  Everyone who has ears, listen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.44'>The kingdom of heaven is like this. Something worth a lot of money is buried in a field.  A man found it and covered it again. He was so glad that he went and sold everything he had. Then he bought that field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.45'>The kingdom of heaven is like this. A trader was looking for fine stones called pearls.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.48'>When it was full, the men pulled it to the land. They sat down and picked out the good fish into baskets. But they threw the bad fish away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.51'>Jesus asked, Have you understood all these stories? The disciples said, Yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.52'>Then Jesus said to them, So anyone who knows the law and has learned about the kingdom of heaven, is like the headman of a house. He can bring both new things and old things out of what he has stored up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.53'>When Jesus had finished telling these stories, he went away from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.54'>He went back to his home town and he taught people in their meeting house. They were very much surprised and said, Where did he learn all this? Where did he get the power to do these big works?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.55'>Is he not the carpenters son? Is not Mary his mother? Are not James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas his brothers?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.57'>They did not understand Jesus. Jesus said to them, Other people honour a man who is a prophet. But the people in his own country and home do not honour him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.5'>Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people. They thought John was a prophet, a man of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.7'>He was so pleased that he promised to give her anything she asked for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.8'>The girls mother told her what to ask for. So she said, Give me here, on a plate, the head of John the Baptizer.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.22'>Then Jesus told the disciples, You get into the boat right away and go ahead of me to the other side of the sea. And I will send these people away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.26'>His disciples saw him walking on the water. They were afraid, and said, It is a spirit!  Then they shouted loudly because they were afraid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.32'>When they got into the boat, the wind stopped blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.33'>Then the men in the boat bowed down in front of Jesus. They said, You really are the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.34'>They crossed over the sea and came to the land at Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.35'>The men there knew him and sent word to the people in all the country around. They brought all the sick people to him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.3'>Jesus asked them, Why do you break Gods law so that you can keep your own law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.4'>God said, "Respect your father and your mother." And God said, "Anyone who says wrong things to his father or his mother will surely die."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.16'>Jesus said, Do you still not understand?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.18'>But what comes out of the mouth, comes from the heart. This is what makes a person dirty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.19'>Here is what comes from the heart: wrong thoughts, killing people, all kinds of adultery,  stealing, lying, and saying wrong things about people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.20'>These things make a person dirty. To eat with hands that are not washed does not make him dirty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.21'>Jesus left that place and went to the country of Tyre and Sidon. 22A woman of the people of Canaan was in that country. She called out, Sir, you are the Son of David.  Help me! My daughter is being troubled very much by a bad spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.31'>Jesus called his disciples to him. He said, I share the suffering of the people. They have been with me for three days and they have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry. If they go away hungry, they will get weak and fall on the way.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.16.4'>People today are wrong. They have gone away from God. They want a sign. No sign will be given them but the sign of Jonah. Then Jesus went away and left them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.4'>So anyone who feels himself small like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.5'>If anyone takes in a child like this for my sake, he takes in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.6'>These little children believe in me. If anyone makes one of them do wrong, he will be punished. He will have worse trouble than if a big stone were tied to his neck and he were thrown into the deep sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.7'>There will be trouble in the world because people make other people do wrong! People will do wrong. But the person who makes another person do wrong will have trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.8'>If your hand or your foot makes you do wrong, cut it off and throw it away! It is better for you to enter into life without hands or feet than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into the fire that burns for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.9'>If your eye makes you do wrong, pull it out and throw it away! It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.15'>If your brother does something wrong to you, go to him. Talk alone to him and tell him what he has done. If he listens to you, you have kept your brother as a friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.16'>But if he does not listen to you, take one or two others with you to talk to him. Then two or three people will hear every word and can prove what was said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.17'>If he does not listen to them, tell the church. If he does not listen to the church, treat him as one who does not believe in God and as bad as a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.18'>I tell you the truth. What you tie on earth will be tied in heaven. What you set free on earth will be set free in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.19'>I tell you another thing. If two of you on earth agree together to ask for something, my Father in heaven will do it for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.20'>Where two or three people meet together in my name, I am there with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.21'>Then Peter came to Jesus and asked him, Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother when he does wrong things to me? Should I forgive him seven times?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.22'>Jesus answered him, I say not seven times only, but seventy times seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.23'>In that way the kingdom of heaven is like this. A king was ready to finish his business with his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.24'>The first servant was brought in. He owed the king a very large sum of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.25'>He could not pay it. So his master said, "Go sell him, his wife, his children, and everything he has, and pay me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.26'>So the servant bowed down in front of him. He begged, "Sir, give me time. I will pay everything."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.27'>His master was sorry for him and let him go. He did not make him pay the money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.28'>That same servant went out and met another servant. This man owed him a much smaller sum of money. He caught him by the throat and said, Pay me what you owe me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.29'>Then this servant bowed down in front of him. He begged, "Give me time. I will pay you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.30'>But he said, "No." He went and put the man in prison until he could pay what he owed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.31'>The other servants saw what he did. They were very sad. They went and told their master everything that had been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.32'>Then his master called the first servant to him. He said, "You bad man! I let you go. I did not make you pay all you owed me, because you begged me to be kind to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.33'>You should have been kind to the other servant, as I was kind to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.34'>His master was very angry. He turned the servant over to the prison guards until he could pay all he owed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.35'>That is like what my Father in heaven will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.19'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.1'>When Jesus had finished this talk, he left Galilee. He went away to the part of Judea that is on the other side of the Jordan River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.2'>Many people followed him. He healed them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.3'>The Pharisees came to Jesus to test him. They asked, Is it right for a man to send his wife away from him for any reason?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.4'>Jesus answered, Have you not read this? From the time God first made people, he made them a man and a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.5'>God said, "A man must leave his father and mother and must stay with his wife. The two of them will be like one person."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.6'>So they are not two people any more, but they are one person. Man must not separate what God has joined together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.7'>They said to Jesus, Then why did Moses make this law? He said that a man may give his wife a paper to show that he does not want her any more. Then he may send her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.8'>Jesus said to them, Moses wrote that law because your hearts are so hard. That is why he let you send your wives away. But in the beginning it was not that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.9'>But I tell you this. No man may send his wife away unless she has committed adultery. If he does, and if he marries another woman, he commits adultery. And if a man marries a woman who has been sent away by her husband, he commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.10'>The disciples said to him, If a man and woman are like that, then it is better not to marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.11'>Jesus said, Not everyone can agree to that. But God has chosen some not to be married.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.12'>Some men cannot marry because they were born that way. Some were made that way by men. Others said, "I will not marry, for the sake of the kingdom of heaven." Anyone who can do this, should do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.13'>Then people brought children to Jesus. They wanted him to put his hands on them and ask God to bless them. The disciples tried to stop the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.14'>But Jesus said, Let the children come to me. Do not try to stop them. The kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.15'>So he put his hands on the children. Then he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.16'>A man came to Jesus and said, Teacher, what good thing must I do so that I will live for ever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.17'>Jesus said, Why do you ask me about what is good? Only God is good. If you want to live for ever, you must keep Gods laws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.18'>The man said, Which laws? Jesus said, Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not tell lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.19'>Respect your father and your mother. Love your neighbour as you love yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.20'>The young man said, I have kept all those laws. What more must I do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.21'>Jesus said, If you want to be all right, go and sell everything you have. Give the money to poor people. For this you will be rich in heaven. Then come and go with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.22'>When the young man heard that, he was sad, because he was very rich. So he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.23'>Then Jesus said to his disciples, I tell you the truth. It is very hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.24'>And I tell you this also. It is easier for a big animal like a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.25'>When the disciples heard this, they were very much surprised. They said, Then who can be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.26'>Jesus looked at them and said, Men cannot do it, but God can do anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.27'>Then Peter said, See, we have left all things and have come with you. So what will we have?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.28'>Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth. In the new world, the Son of Man will be great.  He will sit on his throne of glory &lt;FI&gt;big chair of a king&lt;Fi&gt; to rule. Then you who have come with me will also sit on twelve thrones. You will judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.29'>If anyone has left his house, his brothers, his sisters, his father, his mother, his children,  or his farms for my sake, he will receive a hundred times as much as he has left. And he will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.30'>But many people who are first will be last, and those who are last will be first.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.20'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.1'>The kingdom of heaven is like this. A man owned a farm. Early in the morning he went out to look for men to work on his farm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.2'>He agreed to pay them a days wages and sent them out to his farm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.3'>About nine oclock he went out again. He saw some men standing around at the market.  They were not working.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.4'>He said to them, "You go out to work on the farm too. I will pay you what is right." And they went to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.5'>The man went out again at twelve oclock and at three oclock. He did the same as he had done before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.6'>About five oclock he went out again and found other men standing around. He said to them, "Why have you been standing here all day? Why are you not working?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.7'>They said, "No man has asked us to work." So he said to them, "You go out to work on the farm too."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.8'>When evening came, the man who owned the farm said to his manager, "Call the workmen and pay them. Begin with those who came last and end with those who came first."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.9'>Each of the men who started work at five oclock was paid a days wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.10'>Those who started work first thought they would get more than that. But they also were paid a days wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.11'>They took it, but they were angry and talked against the man who owned the farm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.12'>They said, "These men came last, and worked only one hour. Yet you paid them the same as you paid us. We worked all day, when the sun was hot."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.13'>But he said to one of them, "My friend, I am not doing any wrong to you. You agreed that I should pay you a days wages. Did you not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.14'>Take your money and go. I want to give the last man the same pay as I gave you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.15'>It is my own money. Can I not do with it as I like? Do you think it is a wrong thing for me to be kind?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.16'>In the same way, people who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.17'>On the way to Jerusalem, Jesus took the twelve disciples with him, away from the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.18'>He said to them, We are going to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be given over to the chief priests and scribes. They will judge him and say he must die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.19'>They will give him over to rulers who are not Jews. They will make fun of him. They will beat him and nail him to a cross. On the third day, he will be raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.20'>Then Zebedees wife came with her sons to Jesus. She bowed down in front of him and asked him to do something for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.21'>Jesus asked, What do you want me to do for you? The woman said, These are my two sons. Promise that in your kingdom one may sit at your right and the other at your left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.22'>But Jesus said, You do not know what you are asking for. Can you drink from the cup that I will drink? Yes, they said. We can.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.23'>Then Jesus said to them, You will drink what I drink. But I cannot choose who will sit at my right or at my left. My Father has planned who will sit there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.24'>When the other ten disciples heard about it, they were angry with the two brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.25'>But Jesus called them to him and said, You know that those who rule over countries make their people obey them. The great men will tell the others what to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.26'>But that is not the way it is among you. Anyone among you who wants to be great will help the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.27'>Anyone among you who wants to be first will be a servant to the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.28'>The Son of Man did not come to have others help him. But he came to help others. He came to give his life to make many people free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.29'>As Jesus and the disciples left the city of Jericho, many people followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.30'>Two blind men were sitting by the road. They heard that Jesus was passing that way. So they shouted, Sir, you are the Son of David. Help us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.31'>The people said to them, Be quiet! But they shouted louder, Sir, Son of David! Help us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.32'>Jesus stopped and called the men to him. He asked, What do you want me to do for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.33'>They said, Sir, we want to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.34'>Jesus was very sorry for them as he shared in their suffering. He touched their eyes, and right then they were able to see. They went with him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.21'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.1'>Jesus and his disciples came near to Jerusalem. They came to the village of Bethphage by the hill called the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.2'>He said to them, Go into the village in front of you. As soon as you go in, you will find a donkey for riding, and her young one. They are tied there. Untie them and bring them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.3'>If anyone says anything to you, tell him, "The Lord needs them. He will send them back soon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.4'>This happened, and what the prophet of God said long ago, came true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.5'>He said, Tell the people of Zion: See, your king is coming to you. He is not proud. He rides a donkey. It is a young animal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.6'>The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.7'>They brought the donkey and her young one. They put their coats on them. Then Jesus got on to ride.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.8'>Many people spread their coats on the road. Others cut leaves from the palm trees and put them on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.9'>People in front of him and people behind him shouted, Praise the Son of David! God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord! Praise him in heaven!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.10'>When Jesus came into Jerusalem, all the people there were very excited. They said,  Who is this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.11'>The people who were with Jesus said, This is Jesus from the town of Nazareth in Galilee. He is a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.12'>Jesus went into the temple of God. He drove out all the people who were buying and selling in the temple. He threw down the tables of the money changers. He pushed down the seats of those who sold doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.13'>He said to them, The holy writings say, "My house shall be called a house where people talk with God." But you have made it a place for people who steal!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.14'>Blind people came to Jesus in the temple. People who could not walk came to him. And he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.15'>The chief priests and the scribes saw the big works that Jesus did. They saw the children calling out in the temple, God save the Son of David! They were angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.16'>They asked Jesus, Do you hear what they are saying? Jesus answered, Yes. Have you never read this? "You like the praise of children and babies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.17'>Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany. He stayed there for the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.18'>In the morning he went back to the city. On the way he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.19'>Along the road he saw a fig tree. He went to the tree. There was no fruit on it, only leaves. He said to the tree, No fruit will ever grow on you again! Right away the tree died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.20'>The disciples saw it and were surprised. They said, So soon the fig tree has died!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.21'>Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth. Believe God. Do not doubt him. Then you can do what I did to this fig tree. But that is not all. You can even say to this hill, "Go and jump into the sea" and it will be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.22'>When you ask God for anything, believe that you will have it. Then you will have it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.23'>He came to the temple and went in and taught the people. The chief priests and the leaders of the people came to him. They asked, What right have you to do these things?  Who gave you the right to do them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.24'>Jesus answered them, I will ask you a question also. If you answer me, I will answer you. I will tell you what right I have to do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.25'>Who gave John the right to baptise people? Did God or did men? So they talked it over together. They said, If we say, "God gave John the right to do it," he will say to us,  "Then why did you not believe him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.26'>But if we say, "Men gave him the right to do it," we have the people to fear, because all the people say that John was a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.27'>So they answered Jesus, We do not know. Then Jesus said, Neither will I tell you what right I have to do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.28'>What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first one and said,  "Son, go and work today on my farm."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.29'>The son said, "No, I will not go." But he changed his mind and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.30'>The man went to the second son and said the same thing. The son answered, "Yes, sir, I will go." But he did not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.31'>Which of the two sons did what his father wanted him to do? They said, The first one.  Then Jesus said, I tell you the truth. The tax collectors and women who commit adultery by selling their bodies, are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.32'>John came to you to tell you the right way. But you did not believe him. The tax collectors and women who commit adultery believed him. And even when you saw that,  you did not change your minds and believe him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.33'>Listen to another story. A man planted a farm of vines for growing fruit called grapes.  He put a fence of small trees around it. He dug a place to press the juice from the fruit.  He built a high house from which men could watch over the farm. He let some men pay to use it. Then he went to a country far away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.34'>When it was near the time to cut the fruit, he sent his servants to those men. He wanted to have some of the fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.35'>The men caught the servants. They beat one of them and killed another one of them.  They threw stones at another one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.36'>Then the man sent other servants. There were more than the first time. The men did the same to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.37'>Last of all he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.38'>When the men saw the son, they said to each other, "This is the one who will have everything when his father dies. Let us kill him and we will have it all."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.39'>They caught him, dragged him off the farm, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.40'>When the owner of the farm comes, what will he do to those men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.41'>They answered, He will kill those bad men, and will give the farm to other men who will give him the fruit when it is time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.42'>Jesus said, Have you never read in the holy writings "The stone which the builders would not use is now the chief corner stone. The Lord did this. It looks wonderful to us"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.43'>So I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you. It will be given to the people who do what they should do in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.44'>If anyone falls on this stone, he will be broken to pieces. But if this stone falls on anyone,  it will crush him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.45'>The chief priests and the Pharisees heard the stories Jesus told, and they knew he was talking about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.46'>They wanted to catch him, but they feared the people. The people thought Jesus was a prophet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.22'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.1'>Jesus told them other stories.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.2'>He said, The kingdom of heaven is like this. A king made a wedding for his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.3'>The king sent his servants to call the people who had been asked to the wedding. But they would not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.4'>He sent other servants to call them. He said, "Tell those who were asked to the wedding that my dinner is cooked. The cows and bullocks have been killed. Everything is ready.  Come now to the wedding."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.5'>The people did not listen, but went away. One went to his farm. One went to his business.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.6'>The others caught his servants, treated them very badly, and killed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.7'>The king was very angry. He sent his soldiers to kill the men who had killed his servants.  And he burned their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.8'>Then he said to his servants, "The wedding is ready. But those who were asked to come were not good enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.9'>Go out on the roads. Call all the people you find to come to the wedding."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.10'>So those servants went out on the roads. They brought all the people they could find,  both bad and good people. Then the room was full of people for the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.11'>The king came in to look at the people. He saw one man there who was not wearing the right clothes for a wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.12'>The king said to him, "My friend, why did you come here without putting on the right clothes for a wedding?" The man did not answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.13'>Then the king said to his servants, "Tie his hands and his feet. Put him in a dark place outside. People there will cry and grind &lt;FI&gt;make a noise with&lt;Fi&gt; their teeth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.14'>Many people are asked to come, but only a few are chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.15'>Then the Pharisees went away. They planned how to make Jesus say something wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.16'>They sent their disciples to him with some of Herods people. They said, Teacher, we know that you are true. We know that you teach the true way of God. You do not fear any person, or care how great he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.17'>So tell us. What do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or is it not?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.25'>There were seven brothers among us. The first one married. He died and left no children.  So his brother married the wife.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.27'>Last of all, the woman died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.28'>Now then, when people rise from death, which of the seven brothers will have her for his wife? They all married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.29'>Jesus answered, You are wrong! You do not know what the holy writings say. And you do not know what power God has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.30'>When people rise from death, men and women do not marry. But they are like angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.31'>People do rise from death! Have you never read what God said to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.32'>He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." He is not the God of dead people, but of living people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.36'>Teacher, he said, which law is the greatest law of all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.37'>Jesus said, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart. Love him with all your soul,  and love him with all your mind."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.38'>This is the first and greatest law.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.41'>While the Pharisees were still there, Jesus asked them a question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.42'>He said, What do you think about Christ? Whose son is he? They said, He is Davids son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.43'>Jesus asked, Then how can David call him "Lord"? He said, by the Spirit,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.23.7'>They want people to greet them in the market, and to call them "Teacher".</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.8'>But people should not call you "Teacher". You have one Teacher. And you are all brothers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.23.14'>You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You who are not true to yourselves! You take away the homes of women whose husbands are dead. You cover up your wrong ways by talking big to God for a long time. Because of that, you will be punished harder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.15'>You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You who are not true to yourselves! You travel over sea and land to win one person to believe what you believe. And when he believes, you make him twice as fit for hell as you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.16'>You blind leaders will have trouble. You say that if anyone makes a promise in the name of the temple, he does not have to keep that promise. But if anyone makes a promise in the name of the gold on the temple, he must keep that promise.</verse>

You should be doing these things and the other things too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.24'>You blind leaders! You take a fly out of your cup, but you drink down a big animal like a camel!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.23.34'>That is why I send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them and nail them to a cross. And you will beat some of them in your meeting houses and trouble them from one town to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.35'>So you will be punished for all the blood of every good man that is on the ground. I mean all the blood from the time of Abel, who was a good man, to Zechariah, the son of Barachiah. You killed him between the temple and Gods altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.36'>I tell you the truth. The people who are still living now will be punished for all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.37'>Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets. You throw stones to kill the men who are sent to you! How often I have wanted to gather your people together, as a mother hen gathers her little ones under her wings. But you would not come!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.25.35'>I was hungry. You gave me food. I was thirsty. You gave me a drink. I was a stranger.  You took me in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.36'>I needed clothes. You gave me clothes. I was sick. You came to visit me. I was in prison.  You came to see me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.37'>Then the good people will ask him, "Lord when did we see you hungry and give you food? When did we see you thirsty and give you a drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.38'>When did we see you a stranger and take you in? When did we see you needing clothes and give you clothes?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.25.45'>Then the King will answer them, "I tell you the truth. What you did not do for even the smallest of these, you did not do for me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.46'>And they will go away to be punished for ever. But the good people will go away to live for ever.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.26'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>When Jesus had finished telling all these things, he talked to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.2'>He said, You know that after two days it will be time for the Passover Feast. The Son of Man will be given over to his enemies to be nailed to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then at that time the chief priests and the leaders of the people met together in the house of the high priest. His name was Caiaphas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>They planned how to catch Jesus by some trick and have him killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>But they said, Let us not do it on the day of the feast. We do not want the people to start fighting about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>When Jesus was in the town of Bethany, he was in the house of Simon, a man who had leprosy, a bad skin disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>While Jesus sat at the table, a woman came to him. She had a bottle of oil. It smelled very nice and cost much money. She put the oil on Jesus head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>When the disciples saw this, they were angry. They said, Why was the oil wasted like that?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>The oil might have been sold for much money. Then the money could have been given to poor people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>When Jesus heard it, he said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good thing to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>You will always have poor people with you. But I will not always be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>She has put oil on my body to make me ready to be buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>I tell you the truth. Any place in the whole world where people tell the good news, people will also tell what she has done. People will remember her because of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the chief priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>He said, What will you give me if I help you catch Jesus? They gave him thirty pieces of silver money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And from then on, Judas watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus. Supper</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>It was the first day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, Where do you want us to make ready for you to eat the Passover Feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>He said, Go into the city to a certain man. Say to him, "The Teacher says, My time is near. I will come to your house with my disciples to eat the Passover Feast."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>The disciples did what Jesus told them. They made the Passover food ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>When evening came, Jesus sat down to eat with the twelve disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>As they were eating, Jesus said, I tell you the truth. One of you will give me over to people who hate me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>They were very sad and troubled. One after the other they began to say to him, Lord, is it I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>Jesus answered them, The man who is putting his hand in the dish with me is the one who will give me over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of Man will go away just as the holy writings tell about him. But the man who gives him over will have trouble. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>Judas was the one who would give Jesus over to the people who hated him. He said,  Master, is it I? Jesus said, Yes, it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>As they were eating, Jesus took some bread. He thanked God for it and broke it. He gave it to the disciples and said, Take this bread and eat it. It is my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>He also took a cup. He thanked God for it. Then he gave it to the disciples and said, All of you drink from this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>This is my blood. My blood is the blood of the new agreement. It is given so that many people will be forgiven for the wrong things they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>I tell you this. I will not drink any of the juice of the fruit of the vine again, until I drink some of it new with you in my Fathers kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>They sang a song and then went out to the hill called the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then Jesus said to them, All of you will leave me this night. The holy writings say, "I will kill the one who takes care of the sheep. And the sheep will run away."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after I am raised from death, I will go to Galilee to meet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>Peter said, Even if all the others leave you, I will never leave you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. This night, before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter said, Even if I must die with you, I will never say I do not know you! All the disciples said the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus came to a place called Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, Sit down here. I will go over there and talk with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>He took Peter and Zebedees two sons with him. Jesus began to be sad and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>He said to them, My heart is very sad. I am almost dying! Stay here and watch with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>Jesus went on a little further. He bowed down with his face to the ground. He talked to God and said, My Father, if it can be, let this cup of trouble pass by me. But do not do what I want. May what you want be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>Jesus went back to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, What? Could you not watch with me for one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and talk with God, so that you will not do wrong. A persons heart can want to do it, but his body is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Jesus went away again. He talked to God and said, My Father, if you do not want this cup to pass by me, but you want me to drink it, I will do what you want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>Jesus went back again and found the disciples sleeping. They could not keep their eyes open.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>He left them and went away again. He talked with God the third time and said the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he went back to his disciples and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting?  The time has come now. The Son of Man is given over to bad people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Get up. Let us go. Look, here comes the one who will give me over to people who hate me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>As Jesus was saying this, Judas came. He was one of the twelve disciples. Many people came with him. They had long knives or swords and big sticks. The chief priests and the leaders of the people had sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>The man who was going to help them catch Jesus had told them that he would give them a sign. He said, The man that I kiss is the one. Catch him and hold him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>Right then he went to Jesus and said, Greetings, Master! And he kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>Jesus said to him, Friend, why have you come? Then the men came and caught Jesus and held him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>One of the men who was with Jesus took his sword in his hand. He hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back in its place. All people who fight with a sword will be killed by a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Do you think that I cannot talk to my Father, and he would send me right now more than twelve armies of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>But then, how would Gods word come true? The holy writings say that this is the way it must be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>At that same time Jesus said to the people, Have you come to take me with swords and sticks as you would a man who steals? Every day I sat with you in the temple and taught.  But you did not try to catch me then.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>All this happened so that what the prophets said in the holy writings would come true.  Then all the disciples left Jesus and ran away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>The men who caught Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The scribes and the leaders had met at his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>Peter followed Jesus a long way behind. He went as far as the yard of the high priests house. He sat down with the people who worked for the high priest. He wanted to see how this would end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>The chief priests and all the judges of the court tried to find men to say Jesus had done something wrong so they could kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>But they found nothing. Many people came and said things that were not true. At last two men came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>They said, This man said, "I can break down Gods temple and build it again in three days."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>The high priest stood up. He said to Jesus, Have you no answer? What do you have to say about this? They have said something against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus said nothing at all. Then the high priest said to him, I ask you in the name of the living God. Tell us. Are you the Christ, the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus answered him, Yes, I am. Also I tell you that after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the One who has all power. You will see him coming on the clouds in the sky!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, What he has said is wrong! We do not need any more proof against him. You have heard the wrong thing he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What do you think? They said, He should be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spat on Jesus face and hit him. Others slapped him with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>They said, Christ, tell us, if you know who hit you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Peter sat out in the yard. A servant girl came to him and said, You were also with Jesus of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But Peter said in front of them all, I do not know what you are talking about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>Peter went out to the gate. There, another servant-girl saw him. She said to the others around there, This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>Peter said some bad words and then said, I do not know the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>A little later, those standing around came to Peter and said, Surely you are one of them also. We know it by the way you talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then Peter began to say even more bad words. He said, I do not know the man! Right then, a cock called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said, Before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me. Then Peter went out and cried very much.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>When it was morning, all the chief priests and the leaders of the people made a plan against Jesus. They wanted to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>They tied him and took him away. They took him to Pilate, the ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Judas was the man who helped them take Jesus. He saw that they had judged Jesus and were going to kill him. He was sorry for what he had done, so he brought the thirty pieces of silver money back to the chief priests and leaders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>He said, I have done wrong. I have helped you take a good man who should not be killed. They said, What do we care? You look after that!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>Judas threw the silver money into the temple. He went away and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>The chief priests took the money. They said, It is not right to put this money in the money box of the temple. It has been used to buy a mans death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>They talked the matter over and bought a field that belonged to a man who made pots.  They bought it for a place in which to bury strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>That is why that field has been called The field of blood until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>What Jeremiah the prophet said long ago, then came true at that time. He said, They took thirty pieces of silver money. That is what the people of Israel said he was worth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>They paid for the potters field. That is what the Lord told me to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Jesus stood before the ruler. The ruler asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? Jesus said, Yes, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>When the chief priests and leaders brought their complaints, Jesus said nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to him, Do you not hear what these people say against you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>But Jesus did not answer him, not even one word. Pilate was very much surprised about this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>At the feast Pilate used to let one prisoner free. He let the people choose the man they wanted to go free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>In the prison at that time was a very bad man named Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>So while the people were there Pilate asked them, Which one do you want me to let free for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>Pilate knew that the chief priests did not like Jesus. He knew that was why they had brought Jesus to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>While Pilate was sitting in the court to judge the case, his wife sent a message to him. She said, Do nothing to that good man. I have been troubled very much in a dream about him today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>The chief priests and leaders talked to the people. They told them to ask Pilate to let Barabbas go free, but to kill Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>The ruler said to the people, Which of these two do you want me to let go free for you?  They said, Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate said to them, Then what shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all said,  Nail him to a cross!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>The ruler said, What wrong thing has he done? But they shouted even more, Nail him to a cross!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>Pilate saw that he was not doing any good. And the people were making a lot of loud noise. So he washed his hands in water in front of the people. Then he said, I will not say this man must be killed. You must do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>Then all the people answered, We and our children will do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then Pilate let Barabbas go free. He told the soldiers to beat Jesus and nail him to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then Pilates soldiers took Jesus to a room. They called all the soldiers together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>They took off his clothes, and they put a red gown on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>They made a big ring of thorns like a crown and put it on his head. They put a stick in his right hand. Then they kneeled down in front of him and made fun of him. They shouted,  Greetings, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>They spat on him. And they took the stick and hit him on the head with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>After they had made fun of him, they took off the red gown. They put his own clothes on him. Then they took him away to nail him to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>As they were going, they met a man named Simon. He was born in the country of Cyrene. They made him carry Jesus cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>They came to a place called Golgotha. That means, The place of a head bone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>They wanted Jesus to drink wine mixed with something bitter. Jesus tasted it but he would not drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>Then they nailed him to a cross. They gambled to see how they should divide Jesus  clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>Then the soldiers sat down on the ground and watched him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>They put the complaint against Jesus above his head. These words were written there:  This is Jesus the King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Two bad men were also nailed to crosses. They had stolen money. One man was put on the right side of Jesus and one was put on the left side of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>The people who passed by said bad things about him. They shook their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>They said, You are the man who said you could break down the temple and build it again in three days. Save yourself! If you are really Gods Son, come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>The chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders also made fun of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>They said, He saved other people but he cannot save himself! If he is the King of the people of Israel, he should come down from the cross now. Then we will believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusted in God. If God wants him, he can save him now. He said, "I am Gods Son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>The bad men who were also nailed to crosses with him said the same things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>About midday, the whole land became dark and stayed dark for three hours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>About three oclock, Jesus called out loud, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? That means, My God, my God, why have you left me alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>Some of the people standing there heard what Jesus said. They said This man is calling for Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>Right away, one of them ran to get something called a sponge. He made it wet with sour wine and put it on the end of a stick. With it he gave Jesus a drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>The other people said, Wait. We will see if Elijah will come and save him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>Jesus called out loud again. Then he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>At that time the thick cloth that hung in the temple was torn into two pieces. It was torn from the top down to the bottom. The earth shook and big rocks broke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>The graves opened. Many of Gods people who had died rose from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>They came out of their graves after Jesus rose from death. They went into Jerusalem.  Many people saw them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>The Roman captain and some of his soldiers were guarding Jesus on the cross. When they saw the earth shake and the other things happen, they were very much afraid. They said, Surely this man was Gods Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>Many women were there watching from far away. They had come with Jesus from Galilee and had helped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>Among these women were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedees sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>In the evening, a rich man came. He was Joseph from the town of Arimathea. He also believed in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate said that it should be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>Joseph took the body and wrapped a clean linen cloth around it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>He put the body in his own new grave which had been cut in a rock. He rolled a very big stone to close the grave. Then he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there. They sat where they could see the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>The next day was the Sabbath day. The chief priests and Pharisees went to Pilate together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>They said, Sir, that man fooled people. We remember what he said when he was still living. He said that he would rise after three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>So give orders that the grave must be guarded for three days. Then his disciples cannot come in the night to carry away his body, and tell people he rose from death. This last trick would be worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, Take soldiers. Go and guard the grave as well as you can.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went and shut the grave tight. They put a government mark on the big stone. And the soldiers stayed to guard it. This was to make sure the grave would stay shut.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>The Sabbath day was past. Morning light was beginning to shine on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>The earth shook very much because an angel of the Lord came down from heaven. He came and rolled the big stone away from the grave and sat on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His face shone like lightning. His clothes were as white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>The soldiers who were guarding the grave saw him and shook with fear. They fell down like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>The angel talked to the women. He said, Do not fear. I know you are looking for Jesus,  who was nailed to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here. He has risen, as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>Go quickly and tell his disciples, "He has risen from death. He is going to Galilee before you. You will see him there." Now, I have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>The women went quickly away. They left the grave with fear and they were very happy.  They ran to tell his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>As they were going, Jesus met them. He said Greetings! The women bowed down in front of him and put their hands on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them, Do not fear. Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will see me there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>While the women were going, some of the soldiers who had guarded the grave came into the city. They told the chief priests all that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>The chief priests had a meeting with the leaders of the people and talked the matter over.  They gave much money to the soldiers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>They said, Tell the people, "His disciples came by night and took away the body while we were sleeping."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>If the ruler hears about this, then we will talk to him so that he will not punish you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>The soldiers took the money. They did as they were told to do. And even to this day,  many of the Jewish leaders say this is what happened to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>The eleven disciples went to Galilee. They went to the hill where Jesus had told them to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>When they saw him, they bowed down in front of him. But some people were not sure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>Jesus came and talked to them. He said, All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, Gods Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>The men of God, called prophets, long ago wrote about it this way: God said, See, I send my man ahead of you to tell about you. He will make the way ready for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>A man is calling out in the desert, "Make the way ready for the Lord. Make the road straight for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John baptised people in the desert. He told them to stop doing wrong things and be baptised, and God would forgive them for the wrong things they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>People from all the land of Judea and all the city of Jerusalem went out to John. He baptised them in the Jordan River when they told about the wrong things they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>John wore clothes made of camels hair and a leather belt. He ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>He told the people, Another person is coming. He is greater than I am. I am not good enough to bend down and untie his shoe strings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I have baptised you with water, but he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>At that time Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in the country of Galilee. John baptised him in the Jordan River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>As soon as he came up out of the water, Jesus saw the sky open. He saw Gods Holy Spirit come down on him like a bird called a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>A voice from the sky said, You are my dear Son. I am very pleased with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>Right away, the Spirit made Jesus go into the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>Jesus was in the desert for forty days. All that time Satan tried to make Jesus do wrong.  Jesus was with wild animals. Angels came and took care of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>John was put in prison. Then Jesus went to Galilee. He told people the good news of Gods kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>The time has come, he said. The kingdom of God is here. Stop your wrong ways, turn back to God and believe the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew.  They were throwing a fishing net into the water. Their work was to catch fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>Jesus said to them, Come with me. The work I give you will be to catch people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>Right away they left their nets and went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>Jesus went on from there and saw James and his brother John. Their fathers name was Zebedee. They were in a boat mending their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>Jesus called them. Right away they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the workmen and went with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>They went to the town of Capernaum. As soon as it was the Sabbath day, Jesus went into their meeting house and taught the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>They were very much surprised at his teaching because he taught them as if he had the right to teach them. He did not teach them like their teachers called scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>A man who had a bad spirit in him was in the meeting house at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>He called out, Jesus of Nazareth, what do you want to do to us? Have you come to kill us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>Jesus said to the spirit, Be quiet! Come out of him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>The bad spirit threw the man around. It called out loud and then it came out of the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>The people were all surprised. They said one to another, What is this? Is not this a new teaching? He tells the bad spirits what to do and even they obey him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>The people all around Galilee heard right away about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>As soon as they came out of the meeting house, they went to the home of Simon and Andrew. James and John went also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>Simons wifes mother was sick and was lying down. She had a fever. Right away they told Jesus about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>Jesus went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her right away,  and she began to do things to help them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>That evening when the sun went down, people brought to Jesus all the sick people and those who had bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>All the people in the city crowded around the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>He healed many sick people. He drove the bad spirits out of people. And he did not let them speak because they knew who he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>The next morning Jesus got up long before daylight. He went out to a place by himself.  There he talked with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>Simon and his friends went out after Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>When they found him they said, Everyone is looking for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>Jesus said, We must go to the next towns. I must tell the good news to the people there too. That is why I came here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>Then Jesus talked to the people in all the meeting houses in all the country of Galilee. He also made the bad spirits come out of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>A man who was sick with leprosy &lt;FI&gt;a bad skin disease&lt;Fi&gt; came to him. He kneeled down and begged Jesus saying, I know you can heal me if you want to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>Jesus was very sorry for him. He put out his hand and touched him. He said, I want to.  Be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>As soon as he said this, the disease left the man and he was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>Jesus talked strongly to him and sent him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>He said, Do not tell anyone about this. But go and let the priest look at you. Moses gave a law about the gift you must give to God when you are healed. Give it to prove to people that you are healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But the man went out and told everyone everywhere what had happened to him. Because he did this, Jesus could not go into any large town freely. He stayed in places where only a few people were. There people came to him from everywhere.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>After a few days he came back to Capernaum. People soon heard that he was at home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>Many came together right away. The house was full. There was no more room, not even outside near the door. Jesus was telling them Gods message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>Four men brought a sick man to Jesus. The man could not move his arms or legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>But they could not get in the house where Jesus was, because there were so many people. So they went up on the roof. They made a hole in the roof. Then they let down the mat with the sick man on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>Jesus saw that they believed he would be healed. So he said to the sick man, Son, the wrong things you have done are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>Some of the scribes were sitting there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>They were thinking, Why does this man say such wrong things against God? He is not giving God respect! Who can forgive the wrong things people do? No one but God can do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>Jesus understood in his spirit what the scribes were thinking. He said right away, Why do you think these wrong things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the sick man, "The wrong things you have done are forgiven,"  or to say, "Get up. Take up your mat and walk"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>I want you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive the wrong things people do. So he said to the sick man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>I tell you, get up! Take up your mat and go home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>Right away the man stood up in front of them. He took up his mat and went home. They were all very much surprised, and they praised God. They said, We have never seen anything like this before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>Jesus went out again by the seaside. Many people came to him. So he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus. He was sitting at the place where people come to pay taxes. Jesus said to him, Come with me. Levi stood up and went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>Jesus was eating in Levis house. Many tax collectors and bad people also came. They sat down to eat with Jesus and his disciples. There were many who went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>The scribes and Pharisees saw that Jesus ate with these people. They said to the disciples, Why does he eat and drink with bad people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>Jesus heard it. He said to them, People who are well do not need a doctor. But sick people need him. I did not come to call good people. I came to call bad people to stop doing wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>Johns disciples and the Pharisees disciples were fasting &lt;FI&gt;not eating food for a time&lt;Fi&gt; .  Some people came to Jesus and said, The disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast.  Why do your disciples not do the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>Jesus answered them, The people at a wedding cannot be sad while the man who is married is with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the time will come when he will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No person sews a piece of new cloth on an old coat. If he does, the new cloth will tear the old coat. Then the hole is bigger than it was before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>No person puts new wine into old wine skins. If he does, the new wine will break the skins. Then the wine will be lost and the skins will be spoiled. New wine is put into new skins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>Jesus was walking through the grainfields on the Sabbath day. His disciples began to pick some of the seed (to eat) as they went along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>The Pharisees said to Jesus, Why do your disciples do what is not right on the Sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>Jesus answered them, Have you not read what David did? He and his men who were with him were hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>He went into Gods house when Abiathar was the high priest. Some bread was there for God. It was not right for them to eat it. Only the priests have the right to eat it. But David took the bread and ate it. He also gave some of it to the people who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>Jesus went on to say, The Sabbath was made for the good of man. Man was not made for the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>So the Son of Man rules over the Sabbath day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>Jesus went into the meeting house again. A man was there whose right hand was thin and weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>The Pharisees watched Jesus to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day. They wanted to find something wrong about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>He spoke to the man whose hand was thin and weak. He said, Stand here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>Then he spoke to the Pharisees. He said, Is it right to do good things on the Sabbath day or to do wrong things? Is it right to heal people so they will live, or to let them die? But the Pharisees said nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>Jesus was angry as he looked at them. And he was sad that their hearts were so hard.  Then he said to the man, Hold out your hand. The man did so, and it was made well like the other hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>The Pharisees went out. Right away they and the servants of King Herod planned together how to kill Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>, fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>Jesus and his disciples went away to the sea of Galilee. Many people went with Jesus.  They came from Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and from the other side of the Jordan River. And many more people came also, a great many from around the cities of Tyre and Sidon. They also had heard about the great works that Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>Jesus saw that the crowd was very big. He told the disciples to have a small boat ready for him so that he would have more room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>He did this because he healed many people. All who were sick tried to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>When the bad spirits saw Jesus, they bowed down before him. They shouted, You are Gods Son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>He told them they must not tell anyone who he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>Then Jesus went up on the hill. He wanted some of the people to come with him. So he called them and they came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>He chose twelve disciples to stay with him. He wanted to send them out to other places to tell people Gods word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>He gave them power to heal people and to drive bad spirits out of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>One of the twelve was Simon, whom Jesus called Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>He also chose James and his brother John, the sons of Zebedee, whom he named Boanerges, which means "Men of Thunder."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>, fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>He also chose Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon of Canan, and Judas Iscariot, the one who gave Jesus over to people who hated him. Then Jesus and his disciples went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>So many people came again that they could not even eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>When Jesus family heard about this, they came to take him away. They said, He is crazy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>The scribes who came from Jerusalem also talked about Jesus. They said, Beelzebub,  the chief of bad spirits, is in this man. He drives out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>Jesus called the people and talked to them in stories. He asked, How can Satan drive out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>If one part of a country fights against another part of the country, that country cannot be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>If one part of a family fights against the other part of the family, it cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>If Satan fights against himself and the bad spirits fight against each other, he cannot stand.  It will be the end of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>If anyone wants to go into a strong mans house and steal his things, he must first tie the strong man. Then he can steal his things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>I tell you the truth. All wrong things that people do and say about anyone will be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>But people who say wrong things against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. A person who does that will be punished for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>Jesus said all this because the scribes said, A bad spirit is in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>Jesus mother and brothers came to him. They stood outside. They sent someone to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>Many people were sitting around him. They said, See, your mother and your brothers are outside. They want you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>Jesus asked them, Who are my mother and my brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>Then he looked at the people who sat around him. He said, These people are my mother and my brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>Anyone who obeys God is my brother, my sister, and my mother.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>Jesus began to teach people by the sea again. Many people came to him. So he got in a boat on the sea and sat down. The people were by the sea on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>He told the people stories and taught them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>He said, Listen. A man went out to sow some seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>As he sowed it, some of the seed fell on the road. Birds came and ate the seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>Some seed fell on the stony ground. Not much ground covered the stones. The seed started to grow right away because it was not deep in the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>When the sun began to shine, it was too hot for the new plants. They died because they had no roots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>Some seed fell among the weeds. The weeds grew up and made the new plants die. So no seeds grew on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>But some seed fell on good ground. That seed grew and the plants gave more seed. Some plants gave thirty seeds. Some gave sixty. And some gave a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>Jesus said to them, Everyone who has ears to hear, listen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>Later, Jesus was alone. Then the twelve disciples and the other people who were there asked him about the stories.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>He said to them, You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of God. But we must use stories to tell the other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>They may look and look, but they will not see. They may listen and listen, but they will not understand. If they did understand, they would turn back to God and he would forgive them for the wrong things they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>Jesus said also, Do you not understand this story? How then are you going to understand all the stories?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The man who sows the seed tells Gods message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>Those beside the road are like people who hear the message. But as soon as they hear it,  Satan comes and takes it out of their hearts</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>The seed that fell on the stony ground is the same. It is like people who hear the message and as soon as they hear it they are very glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>They believe it for a short time. When trouble or a hard time comes because of the message, they stop believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>The seed that fell among the weeds is like people who hear the message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>But they think about the things of this world. They want to get money and other things to be happy. These things push the message out of their hearts. No good comes from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>But some seed fell on good ground. That is like people who hear the message and understand it. Much good comes from it. Some people are like the seed that made thirty seeds. Some people are like the seed that gave sixty. Some people are like the seed that gave a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>Then Jesus said to them, People do not bring a light and put it under a basket or under a bed. But they put it on the place for a lamp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>Everything that is hidden will be seen. Everything that is secret will be known and come out to be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>Everyone who has ears to hear, listen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And Jesus said, Take care how you listen. How much you give to others is how much will be given to you. You who obey God will get more than you give.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>Anyone who has some will get more. But he who does not have anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And Jesus said, The kingdom of God is like this. A man sows some seed in the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>Then he goes on just as he did before. He sleeps at night and wakes up in the morning.  The seed begins to grow but he doesnt know what makes it grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>The ground itself makes the seed grow. First the plant comes up. Then it begins to have seed of its own. After a while the harvest is ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>When the harvest is really ready, he cuts it right away because the harvest time has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And Jesus said, What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I say it is like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like this. A mustard seed is the smallest seed that is ever planted in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>But the plant that grows from that seed is bigger than any other plant. It puts out very big branches. The birds come and live in its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>Jesus told the people many stories like this. He told them as much of Gods words as they were able to understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>He did not tell them anything without a story. When he was alone with his disciples, he told them the meaning of the stories.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>In the evening of that day, Jesus said to his disciples, Let us cross over to the other side of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>The disciples left the people and took Jesus away in the boat he was in. Other little boats were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>A very strong wind began to blow. Water came in the boat. It began to fill up with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>Jesus was in the back end of the boat, sleeping with his head on a pillow. The disciples woke him up. Master, they shouted. We will die! Do you not care?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>Then Jesus got up. He said to the wind and the sea, Stop! The wind stopped. Then all was quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>Then he said to the disciples, Why do you fear? Do you not believe in God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>The disciples were surprised. They said to each other, What kind of man is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarene people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>There were graves in that place. As soon as Jesus came out of the boat, a man came from among the graves to meet him. The man had a bad spirit in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>The man lived among the graves. No person could tie him, not even with chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>Many times people had tied him with strong ropes and chains. But he broke the chains and tore the ropes into many pieces. No person was strong enough to hold the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>All the time he stayed in the hills where the graves were. He screamed day and night and cut himself with sharp stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>Jesus was still far from him, but when he saw Jesus he ran to him. He kneeled down in front of Jesus and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>He called out loud, Jesus, Son of the High God, what are you going to do to me? I beg you not to hurt me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>He said this because Jesus had said to him, You bad spirit, come out of the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>Jesus asked, What is your name? He answered, My name is An Army, for we are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>He begged Jesus saying, Do not send us out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Many pigs were feeding on the hill there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>The bad spirits begged Jesus saying, Send us to the pigs so that we can go into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>Jesus let them go right away. The bad spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs.  The pigs ran fast down the steep hill into the sea. They died in the water. The number of pigs was about two thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>Then the men who cared for the pigs ran away. They told the people in the city and all around the country about it. The people went out to see what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>They came to Jesus. They saw the man who had the many bad spirits in him. He was sitting with clothes on and was not crazy any more. The people were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>Those who had seen it told them what had happened to the man who used to have many bad spirits. And they told about the pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>Then the people began to beg Jesus to go away out of their country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>So Jesus got into the boat again. The man who used to have the bad spirits in him begged to go with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>But Jesus did not let him. He said, Go home. Tell your friends what the Lord has done for you. Tell them that he has helped you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>So the man went away and told people in the Ten Towns what Jesus had done for him.  All the people were surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>Jesus crossed over the sea again to the other side. Many people came to him while he was near the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>One of the rulers of the meeting house came to him. His name was Jairus. When he saw Jesus, he kneeled down before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>He said, My little daughter is dying. I beg you, come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>So Jesus went with Jairus. Many people went with Jesus and pushed against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>A woman among them had a sickness for twelve years. She was bleeding all the time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>Many doctors tried to heal her. She spent all the money she had to pay them. She was not better, but was getting worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>When she heard of Jesus, she came among the people behind him. Then she reached out and touched his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>She said to herself, If only I touch his clothes, I will be well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>The bleeding stopped right away. She could feel that she was healed of her trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>Jesus knew right away that power to heal went out from him. He turned around among the people and said, Who touched my clothes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>But his disciples said to him, You see all these people pushing around you. Why do you ask, "Who touched me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>He looked around to see who had done it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>The woman was afraid and trembled. She knew what had happened to her. She kneeled down in front of Jesus and told him the truth about herself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>He said to her, Daughter, you were healed because you believed. Go and do not be troubled. You are healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While Jesus was still talking, some people came from the rulers house. They said, Your daughter has died. Why trouble the Teacher any more?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>Jesus heard it. He said to the ruler, Do not fear. Only believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>Jesus did not let anyone go with him only Peter, James, and his brother John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>They came to the rulers house. Jesus saw that there was trouble. People were crying and making much noise because the rulers daughter had died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>When he came into the house, he said to them, Why do you make so much noise and cry? The girl is not dead, but is sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>They laughed at him. So he sent them all outside. Then he took the girls father and mother and the three disciples into the room where the girl was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>He took her hand and said, Talitha cumi! That means, Little girl, I tell you, get up!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>The girl got up right away and walked around. She was twelve years old. The people were very much surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>Jesus said, Do not tell anyone about this. Give the girl something to eat.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>Jesus left that place and went back to his home town. His disciples went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>On the Sabbath day he began to teach in the meeting house again. Many people who heard him were very much surprised and said, Where did he learn all this? Where did he get the power to do these big works?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is he not the carpenter? Is not Mary his mother? Are not James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon his brothers? Are not his sisters here with us? The people did not understand Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>Jesus said to them, Other people honour a man who is a prophet of God. But the people in his own country, his own home, and his family, do not honour him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>Jesus could not do any big works in that place. But he put his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>He was surprised that the people did not believe him. He went out to the villages,  teaching the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>He called the twelve disciples to him and sent them out two by two. He gave them power to drive bad spirits out of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>He said, Take only a walking stick with you when you go. Do not take anything else. Do not take any food, or a bag, or money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>Wear shoes, but do not take extra clothing with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>When you go into a certain house, live there until you leave the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>In some places the people will not take you in. They will not listen to what you say.  When you leave such a town, shake the dust off your feet. That will be a warning to them. I tell you the truth. On the day when people are judged, the people in that town will be punished harder than the people in the country of Sodom and Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>The disciples went out and told the people that they should stop doing wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>They drove bad spirits out of many people. They also put oil on many sick people and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>King Herod heard about these things. People were talking about Jesus everywhere.  Herod said, John the Baptizer is risen from death. That is why he is able to do such great works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>Other people said, It is Elijah. Others said, He is a prophet like the prophets of God who lived long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>Herod heard what other people said, so he said, I cut off Johns head. He is alive again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>Herod had sent his people to catch John. They tied him and put him in prison to please Herodias. Herod had married her, but she was his brother Philips wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>John had told Herod, It is wrong for you to have your brothers wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>, fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>So Herodias hated John. She wanted to kill him. But she could not because Herod liked John. He knew that John did what was right and was a good man. So he kept John safe.  When he heard John speak he was troubled in his heart, and yet he was glad to hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>rod made a feast on his birthday. He called all his rulers and the captains and the leaders of Galilee to come to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>The daughter of Herodias came in and danced for them. This pleased Herod and the people at the feast. Then the king said to the girl, Ask me for anything you want and I will give it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>He made a promise which he would not break. He said, Anything that you ask me for I will give you, even if you ask me for half of my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>The girl went to her mother and said, What shall I ask for? Her mother said, Ask for the head of John the Baptizer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>The girl came quickly to the king and said, I want you to give me the head of John the Baptizer on a plate. Give it to me right away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>The king was very sorry. But he had made a promise and all the people at the feast had heard him promise. He wanted to do what he promised her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>Right away he sent one of the soldiers who was standing on guard. He told him to bring Johns head. The soldier went to the prison and cut off Johns head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>He brought the head on a plate and gave it to the girl. She gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>When Johns disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and buried it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>The apostles came back to Jesus. They told him all they had done and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>Jesus said to them, Come away with me. Let us go alone to a quiet place and rest for a while. Many people were coming and going. They could not even eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>So they went away in a boat to a lonely place by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>The people saw them going. Many people knew them. The people ran from all the towns and got there ahead of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>When the boat got there, Jesus saw the many people. He was very sorry for them because they were like sheep with no one to care for them. He began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him. They said, This is a lonely place and the time is late.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>Send these people away to farms and villages to buy food for themselves. They have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>Jesus said, You give them food to eat. They said, Shall we go and buy a lot of bread and give them to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>He said, Go and see how much bread you have. When they knew, they told him, We have five loaves of bread and two fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>Jesus told the disciples to make all the people sit on the green grass in groups.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>The people sat down in groups. Some groups were a hundred people and some were fifty people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>Jesus took the five loaves of bread and the two fish. He looked up to heaven and thanked God for them. Then he broke them in pieces. He gave them to the disciples to give to the people. Then he divided the two fish among them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>They all ate and had enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>Then they gathered twelve baskets full of pieces that were left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>The number of men who ate was about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>Then Jesus said to the disciples, You get into the boat right away and go over to Bethsaida. I will send the people away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>When he had sent the people away, he went up on the hill to talk with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>In the evening the boat was far out on the water. Jesus was alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>He saw the disciples working hard rowing the boat. The wind was blowing the wrong way. When it was almost morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He was walking on the water. He was going to pass by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>But when they saw him walking on the water, they thought it was a spirit. They shouted loudly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>They all saw him and were very much afraid. He spoke to them right away. He said, Be glad! It is I. Do not fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>Then he got in the boat with them. The wind stopped. They were very much surprised and did not know what to say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>They did not understand the lesson about the bread because their minds were too slow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>They crossed over the sea and came to the land at Gennesaret. They came to shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>As soon as he got out of the boat, the people knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>They went quickly to all the country around. They brought sick people in their beds to the place where they heard Jesus was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>They laid sick people by the road in villages, towns, and farms and every place he went.  They begged him to let them touch his clothes. And all the people who touched him were healed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>Then some Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem came to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>They saw some of the disciples eating food. They had not washed their hands before they ate. The Pharisees said that was wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>They and all the Jews keep the laws made by men. God did not give them those laws.  They do not eat until they wash their hands very well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>When they come from the market, they do not eat until they have washed themselves.  They also keep many other laws such as washing cups, pots, brass pans, and beds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>The Pharisees and the scribes asked Jesus, Why do your disciples not keep the law our fathers made? Why do they eat with hands that are not clean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>Jesus said to them, Isaiah spoke the truth about you people! You are not true to yourselves! He wrote about you this way: "These people respect me with their mouths.  But their hearts are far from me. They do not mean it in their hearts when they worship me. Their teachings are only words of men."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>He sighed deeply in his spirit and said, Why do people today want a sign? I tell you the truth. No sign will be given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>He left them and went to the other side in a boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>The disciples forgot to take food. They had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>Jesus said, Watch! Take care. Do not let the bread yeast of the Pharisees and Herod spoil you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>The disciples talked to one another about the matter. They said, He says that because we have no bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>Jesus knew what they were saying. He asked, Why are you saying, "We have no bread"? Do you not yet understand? Are your minds so slow?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>Can you not see with your eyes or hear with your ears? Do you not remember?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.19'>When I broke five loaves for five thousand people, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you gather? They said, Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.20'>He said, When I broke seven loaves for four thousand people, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you gather? They said, Seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.21'>He said to them, How is it that you do not yet understand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>Then they came to Bethsaida. Some people brought a blind man to Jesus. They begged him to touch the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.23'>Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. He spat on his eyes and put his hands on him. Then he asked, Do you see anything?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.24'>The man looked up and said, I see men, but they look like trees that are walking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>Jesus put his hands on him again. He made him look up. Then he was healed and could see everybody clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>Jesus sent the man away to his home. Do not go into the village and do not tell it to anyone, he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>Jesus went with his disciples to the villages in Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, Who do people say that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>They answered, People say that you are John the Baptizer. Others say that you are Elijah. And others say that you are one of the prophets from long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>Then he asked them, But who do you say I am? Peter answered, You are the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>Jesus said to them, Do not tell anyone about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>Then he began to teach them. He said, The Son of Man will have much trouble. The leaders, the chief priests, and the scribes will not believe him. He will be killed. After three days he will rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>Jesus said this very plainly. Peter took him to one side and began to tell him not to say such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.33'>Jesus turned around and saw the disciples. Then he talked to Peter. He said, Get away from me, Satan! You are not thinking the way God thinks, but the way people think.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.34'>Jesus called the people and the disciples to him. He said, If anyone wants to come with me he must leave what he himself wants to do. He must be ready to carry his own cross and come with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.35'>Anyone who tries to keep his life will lose it. And anyone who gives up his life for my sake and for the sake of the good news will find it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.36'>What good will it do a man if he gets the whole world for himself but loses his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.37'>What can a person give to get back his soul? People have gone away from God and are full of wrong ways. If anyone in this time is ashamed of me and the things I say, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of that person when he comes. The Son of Man will come with his holy angels, and be great like his Father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.1'>Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth. Some people are standing here who will not die before they see the kingdom of God come with power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>Six days after this, Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him. He led them up a hill by themselves. Jesus was changed in front of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.3'>His clothes were white like light. No person on earth could make them so white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>Then they saw Elijah and Moses talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>Then Peter said to Jesus, Master, this is a good place for us. We will make three places,  one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.6'>Peter did not know what to say because they were very much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>Then a cloud came over them. A voice in the cloud said, This is my dear Son. Listen to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>They quickly looked around but they saw no one except Jesus there with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>When they came down the hill, Jesus said to them, Do not tell anyone what you saw. Do not tell it until after the Son of Man has been raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>So they kept these things to themselves, asking each other what he meant about rising from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>Then they asked Jesus, Why do the scribes &lt;FI&gt;who know all about the holy writings&lt;Fi&gt; say that first Elijah must come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>He said, Elijah does come first. He will get everything ready. But why do the holy writings say that the Son of Man must have much trouble? They say, "He will have much trouble and the people will not respect him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.13'>I tell you that Elijah has come. The people did to him just what they wanted to do. They did just as it is written about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.14'>When they came to the disciples, they saw many people around them. Some scribes were talking with the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.15'>The people were all very much surprised when they saw Jesus. They ran to him and greeted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>Jesus asked his disciples, What are you talking about with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>One of the people said, Teacher, I brought my son to you. A bad spirit is in him so he cannot talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>Wherever it takes hold of him, it throws him around. It makes him foam at his mouth. It makes him make noises with his teeth. He is getting weak and thin. I asked your disciples to drive the bad spirit out, but they could not do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.19'>Jesus said, You people today do not believe. How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>So they brought the boy to him. As soon as the bad spirit saw him, he threw the boy around. The boy fell on the ground and rolled around. Foam was coming from his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>Jesus asked the father, How long has he had this spirit? He answered, Since he was a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>Often it has thrown him in the fire and in the water. It has tried to kill him. If you can do anything for him, show us that you share our suffering by helping us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.23'>Jesus said to him, You say, "If you can." Anything can be done for the person who believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>Right away the father of the child, with tears in his eyes, said loudly, I do believe! Help me to believe more!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>Jesus saw many people come running together. He talked to the bad spirit: You bad spirit who stops the boy from hearing and talking! I tell you, come out of him and do not go into him again!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>The bad spirit screamed and threw the boy around. Then it came out of him and left him like a dead person. Many of the people even said, The boy is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.27'>But Jesus took his hand and helped him to get up. The boy stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>Jesus went into the house. His disciples were alone with him. They asked him, Why could we not drive out the bad spirit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>Jesus said to them, This kind of bad spirit does not come out unless people talk to God and fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>Then they left that place and went through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>He taught his disciples. He said to them, The Son of Man will be given over to men.  They will kill him. When he is killed, he will rise after three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>The disciples did not understand what he said and they were afraid to ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked the disciples, What were you talking about on the way coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.34'>But they said nothing, because on the road they had been talking among themselves about who was the greatest person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>He sat down and called the twelve disciples to him. He said, The way to be first is to put yourself last and be a servant to the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.36'>Jesus took a child and had him stand in front of them. Then he took the child in his arms and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.37'>If anyone takes in a child like this for my sake, he takes in me. If anyone takes in me, he takes in the One who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.38'>John said to him, Master, we saw a man driving bad spirits out of people. He was using your name, but he is not one of us. So we told him to stop because he is not one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.39'>Jesus said, Do not stop him. Anyone who can do a great work in my name will not be quick to say wrong things about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.40'>He that is not against us is on our side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.41'>I tell you the truth. If anyone gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, he will not lose his reward</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.42'>These little children believe in me. If anyone makes one of them do wrong, he will be punished. He will have worse trouble than if a big stone were tied to his neck and he were thrown into the deep sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.43'>If your hand makes you do wrong, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life with one hand than to have two hands and go into hell. Hell fire never dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.44'>In hell their worm will not die and the fire will not stop burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.45'>If your foot makes you do wrong, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life with one foot than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. Hell fire never dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.46'>In hell their worm will not die and the fire will not stop burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.47'>If your eye makes you do wrong, take it out. It is better for you to go into Gods kingdom with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.48'>In hell their worm will not die and the fire will not stop burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.49'>Everyone must be tested by fire. Every sacrifice must have salt on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.50'>Salt is good. But if the salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again? You must have salt in yourselves and live in peace with one another.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.10'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.1'>Jesus left that place and went through the country of Judea on the other side of the Jordan river. Many people came to him there again. He taught them as he always did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.2'>The Pharisees came to him and asked, Is it right for a man to send his wife away from him? They asked this to test Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.3'>Jesus answered, What law did Moses give you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.4'>They said, Moses allowed a man to write a paper to show that he does not want her any more. Then he may send her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.5'>Jesus said to them, Moses wrote that law because your hearts are so hard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.6'>From the time God first made people, he made them man and woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.7'>That is why a man must leave his father and mother and stay with his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.8'>The two of them will be like one person. So they are not two people any more, but they are one person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.9'>Man must not separate what God has joined together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.10'>When they were in the house, the disciples asked Jesus about this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.11'>So Jesus said, If any man sends away his wife and marries another woman, he commits adultery against her. &lt;FI&gt;He takes another woman who is not his wife.&lt;Fi&gt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.12'>If a woman sends away her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.13'>They brought children to Jesus. They wanted him to put his hands on them. The disciples tried to stop the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.14'>When Jesus saw what the disciples did, he did not like it. He said, Let the children come to me. Do not try to stop them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.15'>I tell you the truth. If anyone does not believe in the kingdom of God like a child, he will never go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.16'>Jesus took the children up in his arms. He put his hands on them and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.17'>Jesus started on the way again. A man came running and kneeled down before him. He said, Good Teacher, what must I do so that I will live for ever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.18'>Jesus said, Why do you call me good? Only God is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.19'>You know the laws: "Do not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not tell lies.  Do not cheat. Respect your father and your mother."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.20'>The man answered Jesus. He said, Teacher, I have kept all those laws since I was a boy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.21'>Jesus looked at him. He loved him. He said, You need one thing more. Go home. Sell everything you have. Give the money to the poor people. You will be rich in heaven. So be ready to carry your own cross and come with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.22'>When the young man heard that, he was sad, because he was very rich. So he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.23'>Then Jesus looked around at his disciples and said to them, It is very hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.24'>The disciples were surprised at his words. But Jesus said again, Children, it is very hard for people who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.25'>It is easier for a big animal to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.26'>They were very much surprised. They said, Then who can be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.27'>Jesus looked at them and said, Men cannot do it but God can, because God can do anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.28'>Peter began to speak and said to him, See, we have left all things and have come with you.</verse>

He will have a hundred times as many houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and farms. He will have trouble also. But in the next world he will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.31'>But many people who are first will be last, and those who are last will be first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.32'>Jesus and his disciples were on the road to Jerusalem. Jesus was walking in front of them.  The disciples were surprised. And the people who came behind were afraid. He took the twelve disciples and began to tell them what was going to happen to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.33'>He said, We are going to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be given over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will judge him and say he must die. They will give him over to rulers who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.34'>They will make fun of him. They will spit on him. They will beat him and kill him. After three days, he will rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.35'>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and said, Master, we want you to do for us anything we ask you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.36'>Jesus said, What do you want me to do for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.37'>They said, Let one of us sit at your right side and one at your left side when you rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.38'>But Jesus said, You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink from the cup that I will drink from? Can you go through the big trouble that I will go through?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.39'>Yes, they said. We can. Then Jesus said to them, You will drink what I drink and you will have trouble the way I will have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.40'>But I cannot choose who will sit at my right hand or at my left. It has been planned who will sit there.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.42'>Jesus called them and said, You know the people who rule over countries make their people obey them. The great will tell the others what to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.43'>But that is not the way it is among you. Anyone among you who wants to be great must help the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.44'>Anyone among you who wants to be first shall be a servant to the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.45'>The Son of Man did not come to have others help him. But he came to help others. He came to give his life to make many people free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.46'>Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples left Jericho, many people followed him. A blind man named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road. He was begging for money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.47'>He heard that Jesus of Nazareth was passing. So he shouted, Jesus, Son of David! Help me!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.11'>And so Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple. He looked at everything. Then he went out with the twelve disciples to Bethany. It was late already.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.13'>He saw a fig tree a little way off with leaves on it. So he went to see if it had figs. He came to the tree. There was no fruit on it, only leaves. It was not the time for figs.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.15'>They reached Jerusalem. Jesus went into the temple. He began to drive out the people who were buying and selling in the temple. He threw down the tables of the money changers. He pushed down the seats of those who sold doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.16'>He would not let anyone carry anything through the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.17'>He taught the people, saying, The holy writings say, "My house shall be called a house for all tribes and nations, where people talk with God." But you have made it a place for people who steal!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.18'>The chief priests and scribes heard what he said. They wanted to find some way to kill him. They feared Jesus because all the people were surprised at his teaching.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.21'>Peter remembered about it. He said, Look Master, you cursed the fig tree and it has died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.22'>Jesus said, Believe in God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.26'>But if you do not forgive others, your Father in heaven will not forgive you for the wrong things you have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.27'>They came to Jerusalem again. Jesus walked in the temple. The chief priests, the scribes,  and the leaders came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.28'>They said, What right have you to do these things? Who gave you the right to do them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.29'>Jesus said, I will ask you a question. If you answer me, I will answer you and tell you what right I have to do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.30'>Who gave John the right to baptise people? Did God or did men? Answer me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.31'>So they talked it over together. They said, If we say, "God gave John the right," he will say, "Then why did you not believe him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.32'>But what if we say, "Men gave him the right to do it"? They feared the people because they all believed that John was a prophet of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.33'>So they answered Jesus, We do not know. Then Jesus said, Neither will I tell you what right I have to do these things.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.12'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>Jesus then began to speak to the disciples in stories. A man planted a farm of vines for growing fruit called grapes. He put a fence of small trees around it. He dug a place to press the juice from the fruit. He built a high house from which men could watch over the farm. Then he let some men pay to use it and went to a country far away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>At harvest time the owner sent one his servants to get some of the fruit from the farm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>The men took the servant and beat him. They sent him away without any fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.4'>He sent another servant. They hurt this one also, and cut his head. The things they did to him were very wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.5'>So he sent another servant. The men killed him. He sent many others, and the men beat some and killed others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.6'>There was one left. He was his own son. He sent him last. He said, "They will respect my son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.7'>But the men said to each other, "This is the one who will have everything when his father dies. Let us kill him. Then everything will belong to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.8'>They killed him and threw his body outside the farm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.9'>What will the man who owned the farm do to them? He will come back and kill the men in the farm. And he will give the farm to other men to use.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.10'>Have you not read this writing: "The stone which the builders would not use is now the chief stone of the corner. The Lord did this. It looks wonderful to us."?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>They tried to catch Jesus but they feared the people. They knew that Jesus had spoken this against them. So they left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>They sent some Pharisees and some of Herods people to Jesus. They planned how to make Jesus say something wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>They came and said to him, Teacher, we know that you are true. You do not fear any person or care how great he is. But you teach the true way of God. Tell us, is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or is it not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>Should we pay taxes or not? Jesus knew they were trying to get him into trouble. So he said to them, Why are you trying to get me to do wrong? Bring me a piece of money.  Let me look at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.16'>They brought one to him. He asked, Whose picture and name is this? They answered,  Caesars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.17'>So he said, Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and give to God what belongs to God.  The Pharisees and Herods people were much surprised at Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>Some of the Sadducees came to Jesus. They say that people do not rise from death. They asked Jesus a question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>Teacher, they said, Moses gave us this law: if a man dies and leaves a wife but no children, then his brother must marry the wife and raise a family for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>There were seven brothers. The first one married. He died and left no child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.21'>e second brother married the wife. He also died and left no child. It was the same with the third one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>All seven brothers married her. They all had no children. Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>Now then when people rise from death, whose wife will she be? All seven of them had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>Jesus said to them, You are wrong! You do not know what the holy writings say. And you do not know what power God has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>When people rise from death, men and women do not marry. But they are like angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>People do rise from death! Have you never read what Moses wrote? It is in the place where we read about the small tree which burned. Moses tells how God said to him, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.27'>He is not the God of dead people, but of living people. The way you look at things is wrong altogether.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>One of the scribes heard them talking. He saw that Jesus gave them a good answer. Then he came and asked, Which law is the greatest law of all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>Jesus answered, The greatest one is, "Hear, O Israel. The Lord our God is one Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>Love the Lord your God with all your heart. Love him with all your soul. Love him with all your mind. And love him with all your strength."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>The second law is this: "Love your neighbour as you love yourself." No law is greater than these laws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>Then the scribe answered Jesus, Teacher, what you say is right. There is one God.  There are no other gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>Love God with all your heart. Love him with all your understanding. Love him with all your strength. That is much better than to burn offerings and make sacrifices. Love your neighbour as you love yourself. That is better than any of these offerings and sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>Jesus saw that the scribe was wise. So he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. After that everyone feared to ask him any more questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>Jesus was teaching people in the temple. He said, How can the scribes say that Christ is Davids son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>The Holy Spirit spoke through David and he himself said: "The LORD said to my Lord,  Sit beside me until I make you master over your enemies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.37'>So David calls Christ his Lord. How can Christ be Davids son? Most of the people were glad to hear Jesus teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>Jesus went on to teach them. He said, Take care. Do not let the scribes fool you by the way they do things. They like to walk about with long gowns. They want people to greet them in the market.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.39'>They want to sit in the front seats in the meeting houses. They want to sit in the best places at feasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>They take away the homes of women whose husbands are dead. They cover up the wrong things they do by talking to God a long time. They will be punished more!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>Jesus sat down in the temple near the place where people put in their money. He saw how the people put in money. Many rich people put in much money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>A poor woman, whose husband was dead, came. She put in two small pieces of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>Jesus called his disciples. He said, I tell you the truth. This poor woman has given more money than all the other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>All these people had plenty of money and they gave only a part of it. She was poor and she gave everything she had. She has nothing left to live on.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.13'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.1'>When Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said, Look Master, see those big stones and the wonderful houses!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.2'>Jesus said, You see these big houses? I tell you, not one stone here will be left on top of another. They will all be thrown down!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.3'>Afterwards, he was sitting on the hill called the Mount of Olives, near the temple. Peter,  James, John, and Andrew came to him alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.4'>They said, Tell us, when will this happen? What will be the sign when these things are going to be done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.5'>Then Jesus began to talk to them. He said, Take care. Do not let anyone fool you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.6'>Many men will come in my name. They will say, "I am Christ." They will fool many people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.7'>You will hear about wars. You will hear that war is coming. But do not fear. These things must happen, but that is not yet the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.8'>One tribe will fight against another tribe. And one country will fight against another country. The earth will shake in many different places. People will have no food to eat.  These troubles are only the beginning of the troubles that will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.9'>But you must take care. Men will take you to court. They will beat you in their meeting houses. They will take you to rulers and kings because you are true to me. You will talk to them about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.10'>The good news must first be told to all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.11'>When men take you to court, do not be troubled about what you will say. Say whatever comes to your mind at that time. It is not you who speak, but it is the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.12'>A brother will take his brother to be killed. A father will take his child. The children will talk against their father and mother and have them killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.13'>All people will hate you because you are true to me. But the person who keeps on being true to me until the end will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.14'>Daniel the Man of God said that people would put something very bad in the temple.  (Let the one who reads this understand it.) When that happens, the people in Judea must go quickly to the hills.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.16'>Those who are working in the fields must not go back to get their coats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.17'>In those days it will be very hard for women who are to have a child. It will be very hard for mothers who have babies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.18'>Ask God that you may not have the trouble in the cold time of the year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.19'>The trouble then will be bigger than any trouble since God made the world. And there never will be any trouble as big as that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.20'>No person would be saved if the Lord did not make the time of trouble shorter. He will make it shorter for the sake of his chosen people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.21'>If anyone says to you then, "Look, here is the Christ!" or, "There he is!" do not believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.22'>People will come and say they are the Christ. People will come and say they are prophets of God. But they are not true to themselves. They will show big signs and do wonderful things that will fool people. They will fool Gods chosen people if they can.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.1'>The Passover Feast and the feast with bread that has no yeast in it was two days later.  The chief priests and the scribes planned how to catch Jesus by some trick. They wanted to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.2'>But they said, Let us not do it on the day of the feast. We do not want the people to start fighting about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.3'>When Jesus was in the town of Bethany, he was in Simons house. Simon had leprosy.  While Jesus sat at the table, a woman came to him. She had a bottle of oil. It smelled very nice and cost much money. She broke the bottle and poured the oil on Jesus head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.4'>Some people there were angry. They said, Why was this oil wasted like that?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.5'>The oil might have been sold for a lot of money. Then the money could have been given to poor people. They said to the woman, You should not have done this!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.6'>But Jesus said, Leave the woman alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good thing to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.7'>You will always have poor people with you. Any time you want to, you can do good to them. But I will not always be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.8'>She has done what she could. She has put oil on my body to make me ready to be buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.9'>I tell you the truth. Any place in the whole world where people tell the good news, people will also tell what she has done. People will remember her because of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.10'>Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the chief priests. He told them how he could help them catch Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.11'>They were glad when they heard that. They promised to give him money. So he watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.12'>It was the first day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. The sheep had to be killed for the Passover Feast. His disciples asked Jesus Where do you want us to make ready for you to eat the Passover Feast?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.38'>All of you must watch and talk with God so that you will not do wrong. A persons heart can want to do it, but his body is weak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>Jesus answered, Yes, I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the One who has all power. You will see him coming on the clouds of the sky!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, We do not need any more proof against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>What he has said is wrong! What do you think? They all said, He should be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>Some people began to spit on him. They covered his face and hit him. They laughed at him and said, Tell us if you know who hit you! The guards took him away and hit him as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>Peter sat out in the yard. A servant girl who worked for the high priest came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>She saw Peter warming himself by the fire. She looked at him and said, You were also with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But Peter said, I do not know or understand what you are talking about. Peter went out to the gate. Then a cock called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>A girl saw Peter there and said to the other people standing by, This man is one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>But again Peter said he was not. A little while after, those standing around said to Peter,  Surely you are one of them also. You come from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>Then Peter began to curse and say bad words. He said, I do not know this man you are talking about!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>Right then the cock called a second time and Peter remembered that Jesus had said,  Before the cock calls two times, you will say three times that you do not know me.  Then he broke down and cried.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>As soon as it was morning, the chief priests, leaders, and the scribes talked together.  They tied Jesus and took him before Pilate to be judged.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>Joseph went to buy some cloth. Then he took Jesus down and wrapped him in the cloth.  He laid him in a grave that had been cut in a rock. Then he rolled a very big stone to close the grave.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>One woman said to the other, Who will roll away the big stone from the grave for us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>The stone was very big. When they looked up they saw that the stone was rolled away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>So they went in the grave. They saw a young man dressed in a white gown. He sat at the right side. They were very much surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>He said, Do not be surprised. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth who was nailed to a cross. He is risen. He is not here. Look, here is where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>Go and tell his disciples and Peter. Tell them he is going to Galilee before you. You will see him there as he said to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>Then they left the grave quickly. They were trembling and afraid. They did not talk to anyone about it because they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Jesus rose early on the first day of the week. He showed himself first to Mary Magdalene. Jesus had driven seven bad spirits out of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went and told the disciples that she had seen him. They were still crying because Jesus was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>Mary told them that he was living. She had seen him. But they would not believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>After this, Jesus came to two disciples. He looked like a different person. They were walking out in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>They went back and told the rest of the disciples, but they would not believe them either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Then after that Jesus showed himself to the eleven disciples while they were eating. He said it was very bad for them not to believe and for their minds to be slow. He said they should have believed those who saw him after he rose from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>Then Jesus said to them, Go into every part of the world. Tell the good news to everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>The one who believes the good news and is baptised will be saved. But he who does not believe will be judged and punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>These signs will be with those who believe. They will drive bad spirits out of people by using my name. They will speak new languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>They will take up snakes. If they drink poison, it will not make them sick. They will put their hands on sick people and sick people will get well again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>So after the Lord Jesus had talked to them, he went up into heaven and sat down beside God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>Then the disciples went and told the good news everywhere. The Lord worked with them. He made their words come true by the signs that happened after they talked.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Many people have tried already to write down the things that have happened among us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>These things were told us by men who saw them happen from the time they began to happen. And these men helped tell the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>I have tried to find out all that has happened from the beginning. And so, Theophilus,  great ruler, I myself will write you the whole story.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>Then you will know that the things people have told you are true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>When Herod was king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah. He was one of a group of priests, and Abijah was their leader. Zechariahs wife Elizabeth came from the family of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>Both of them were good people as God saw them. They obeyed all the laws and the things that the Lord said they should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>But they had no children. Elizabeth was not able to have a baby and they were both very old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>Zechariah was doing his work one day as a priest to God. It was time for his group to do the work in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>The priests had a certain way of dividing their work. This day it was Zechariahs turn to go into the temple of the Lord and burn the incense &lt;FI&gt;that smells sweet when it is burned&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>All the people were talking to God outside the temple at this time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>An angel of the Lord came to Zechariah. He was standing on the right side of the incense table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>When Zechariah saw him, he was surprised and afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said, Do not be afraid, Zechariah. You have been talking to God. He has heard you. Your wife Elizabeth will have a son. Name him John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>You will be glad and happy. Many people will be glad when he is born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>He will be great in the way the Lord calls people great. He must not drink wine or any strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the time he is born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>He will go ahead of the Lord. He will have the spirit and power of Elijah. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children. And he will bring back the people who do not obey,  so that they will want to do what good people do. He will make people ready for the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>Then Zechariah said to the angel, How can I know that this will happen? I am an old man and my wife is also old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>The angel answered him, I am Gabriel and I stand before God. I have been sent to talk to you and to bring you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>Now listen. You will be silent and not be able to talk until the day that all this has happened. This is because you did not believe what I told you. At the right time all that I said will come true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>the people were waiting for Zechariah to come out of the temple. They were surprised that he stayed in so long.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>When he came out, he could not talk to them. They knew that he had seen something in the temple. He made signs to them with his hands and did not talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>When his time for doing the work of a priest was finished, Zechariah went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>After that, his wife Elizabeth found she was going to have a baby. For five months she stayed away from people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>She said to herself, The Lord has done this for me. At this time he has remembered me so that I need not be ashamed among people anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Elizabeth was now in her sixth month. God sent the angel Gabriel to the town of Nazareth in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>The angel was sent to a young woman there. Her name was Mary. She was promised to a man named Joseph, to be his wife. He was of Davids family line.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>The angel went into the house and said to her, Be happy! God has blessed you more than other women. The Lord is with you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>What the angel said troubled Mary. She wondered what this greeting meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>The angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary. God has blessed you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>You will have a baby son. Name him Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He will be a great man. He will be called the Son of the Highest One &lt;FI&gt;a name for God&lt;Fi&gt; .  The Lord God will make him king where his father David was king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>He will be king over the people of Israel for ever. He will never stop being king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Then Mary said to the angel, How can this happen? I have no husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>The angel answered, The Holy Spirit will come to you. The power of the Highest One will be over you. That is why the holy child who is to be born will be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>Your cousin Elizabeth is also going to have a baby son, though she is an old woman.  This is the sixth month for her. She is one whom people said would not have a baby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>But God can do anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>Mary said, I am the Lords servant. Let it be as you have said. Then the angel left her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>At that time, Mary got ready and went as quickly as she could to the hill country. She went to a town in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>She went into the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>When Elizabeth heard Marys greeting, the baby in her moved. Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>She said in a loud voice, God has made you happy and blessed you more than all other women. He has blessed your baby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>Who am I that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>Listen! When I heard your greeting, the baby inside me moved because he was glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>She who has believed what was told her is blessed. What the Lord said to her will come true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>Mary said, My heart is praising the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>And my spirit is happy because God has saved me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>He has remembered his servant even though she is not a great person. From now on all people of all times will say God has blessed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>He who has all power has done a big work for me. His name is holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>He is kind to people of all times who respect him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has shown how strong he is with his arm. He has taken away people who were proud in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He has moved big rulers from power, and those that were not great he has made great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He has given hungry people good things to eat, and sent away the rich people with nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has helped his servant Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>He has remembered to be kind just as he said to our fathers of long ago. He promised to be kind to Abraham and his childrens children for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>Mary stayed with Elizabeth for three months. Then she went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>The time had now come for Elizabeths child to be born. She had a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>When her neighbours and family heard that the Lord had been so kind to her, they were glad, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>On the eighth day people came to circumcise &lt;FI&gt;make a special mark on&lt;Fi&gt; the child. They were going to name him Zechariah like his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>But his mother said, No, his name is to be John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>They said to her, But no one in your family has that name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>They made signs to the father to find out what name he wanted the child to have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>He asked for something to write on. He wrote, His name is John. They were all surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>Right then he opened his mouth and his tongue was free. He began to speak and to praise God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>Everyone who lived around there began to wonder at these things. And everywhere in the hill country of Judea, all these things were talked about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>All those who heard them thought much about them. They said, What will this child be some day? They said this because the power of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke words from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>He said, Praise the Lord God of Israel! He has remembered his people, and set them free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>He has chosen one from the family of his servant David. He has given him power to save us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>That is what he promised through his holy prophets of God long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>He said he would save us from our enemies and set us free from those who hate us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>He said he would be kind to our fathers. He said he would remember his agreement with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>That was what he promised our father Abraham he would surely do. He promised to set us free from our enemies. He promised that we should be without fear. He promised that we would worship him and be holy and good before him as long as we live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>You, my child, will be called the prophet or messenger of the Highest One. You will go ahead of the Lord to make his way ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>You will tell his people how to be saved by being forgiven for their wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Our God is kind. A light from heaven will shine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>That light will shine on those who are in darkness, and are going to die. That light will show us how to walk in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>The child grew. He became strong in spirit. He lived in the desert until the day when he came to the people of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>The angels left them and went back to heaven. The men who were taking care of the sheep said to one another Let us go to Bethlehem and see what has happened. It is the Lord who has told us about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>They went quickly. They found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the box where cows feed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>When the child was eight days old, it was time to circumcise him. They named him Jesus.  That was the name the angel gave him before the baby began to grow inside Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>The time came when Mary was no longer unclean by the law of Moses. Joseph and Mary took Jesus to Jerusalem to bring him to the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>Anna, a woman prophet of God, was there too. Her fathers name was Phanuel. She was of the tribe of Asher. She was very old. She had been married and lived with her husband for seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>Then her husband died. Now she had been alone for eighty-four years. She did not leave the temple, but worshipped day and night. She talked with God and fasted &lt;FI&gt;did not eat food for a time&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>On the third day they found him in the temple. He was sitting in front of the teachers of the law. He was listening to them and asking them questions.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>The people came close around Jesus to hear Gods word. He was standing by Lake Gennesaret &lt;FI&gt;the Sea of Galilee&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>He saw two boats by the water. The fishermen were not in their boats. They were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>Jesus got into one of the boats. It was Simons boat. Jesus asked him to put the boat out into the water a little way from the land. Then he sat down in the boat and taught the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>When he stopped talking, he said to Simon, Put the boat out into deep water and let down your nets to catch some fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>Simon answered, Master, we worked hard all night and did not catch anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>When they did this, they caught many fish. Their nets were so full they were breaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>They called their friends in the other boat to come and help them. They came. They filled both boats with so much fish, they began to go down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>When Simon Peter saw this, he kneeled down in front of Jesus. He said, Lord, leave me because I am a bad man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>He was very much surprised to see how many fish they had caught. All those who were with him were surprised too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were helping Simon. They were surprised also.  Jesus said to Simon, Do not fear. From now on your work will be to catch men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>They brought their boats to the land. Then they left everything and went with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>Jesus was in one of the cities and a man was there who had leprosy, a bad skin disease.  When he saw Jesus, he bowed his face to the ground. He begged Jesus saying, Sir, I know you can heal me if you want to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>Jesus put out his hand and touched the man. He said, I want you to be healed. Right away the man was free from leprosy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>Jesus said to him, Do not tell anyone about this. But go and let the priest look at you.  Moses gave a law about the sacrifice you must give when you are healed. Give it to prove to the people that you are healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But more people heard about Jesus than before. And many people gathered to hear him,  and so be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>Many times Jesus went away to the desert and talked with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>One day Jesus was teaching people. Pharisees and other Jewish teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every town in Galilee and Judea, and from Jerusalem.  Jesus had the power of the Lord to heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>Some men brought a sick man on his bed. The man could not move his arms or legs.  They tried to bring him in and put him in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>But they could not get in the house where Jesus was, because there were so many people. So they went up on the roof. Then through a hole in the roof they let down the bed with the sick man on it, until he was in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>Jesus saw that they believed he would be healed. So he said to him, Man, the wrong things you have done are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>The scribes and Pharisees began to talk about this. They said, Who is this man that is not giving respect to God? No one but God can forgive anyone for the wrong things they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, Why do you think these wrong things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier, to say, "The wrong things you have done are forgiven," or to say, "Get up and walk"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>I want you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive wrong things people have done. So he said to the sick man, I tell you, get up. Take up your bed and go home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>Right away the man stood up in front of them. He took up his bed and went home praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>The people were all surprised and they praised God. They did not know what to think.  They said, We have seen things today that are hard to believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>After this, Jesus went out. He saw a tax collector named Levi. Levi was sitting at the place where people came to pay taxes. Jesus said to him Come with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>Levi left everything. He stood up and went with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>Levi made a big dinner at his house for Jesus. Many tax collectors and other people were sitting at the table with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>The Pharisees and their scribes did not like what Jesus disciples did. They said, Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and bad people?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>Jesus answered them, People who are well do not need a doctor. But sick people need him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>Jesus told them a short story. He said, No one takes a piece from a new coat and sews it on an old coat. If he does, the new coat will have a hole. And the new piece will not be like the old coat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>No one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will break the skins.  The wine will be lost and the skins will be spoiled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.1'>Jesus was walking through the grain fields on a Sabbath day. His disciples picked some of the grain as they went along. They cleaned it by rubbing it in their hands, and ate it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>Some of the Pharisees said, Why do your disciples do what is not right on the Sabbath day?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>Jesus answered them, Have you not read what David did? He and his men were hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.4'>He went into Gods house. Some bread was there for God. But David took the bread and ate it. He also gave some of it to the men who were with him. Only the priests have the right to eat that bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.5'>Jesus said to them, The Son of Man rules over the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.6'>On another Sabbath day, Jesus went into the meeting house and taught. A man was there whose right hand was thin and weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.7'>The scribes and Pharisees watched Jesus to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day. They wanted to find something wrong about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.8'>But Jesus knew what they were thinking. He spoke to the man whose hand was thin and weak. He said, Come and stand here in front The man stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>Jesus said to them, I ask you, is it right to do good things on the Sabbath day, or to do wrong things? Is it right to heal people so that they will live, or to let them die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>He looked around at them all. Then he said to the man, Hold out your hand. The man did so and it was made well like the other hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.11'>The Pharisees were very angry and they talked together about what they could do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.12'>About that time Jesus went out of the city on the hill to talk with God. He talked with God all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.13'>In the morning he called his disciples to him. He chose twelve of them and called them apostles &lt;FI&gt;special messengers&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>Jesus was surprised when he heard this. He turned to the people who followed him. He said, I tell you, I have not found a Jew who believes as this man does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>The men who had been sent to Jesus went back into the house. They found that the servant who had been sick was well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>Soon after that, Jesus went to the town of Nain. His disciples and many other people went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>He came near the gate of the town. There he met people carrying out a man who had died. He was the only son of his mother. And her husband was dead too. Many people from the city were with her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>He answered Johns disciples, Go tell John what you have seen and heard. Blind people see. The lame people walk. People with leprosy are healed. People who could not hear can hear. Dead people are alive again. Poor people hear the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>Happy is the person who is not troubled in his heart about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>When Johns messengers had gone away, Jesus began to talk to the people about John.  He said, What did you go out into the desert to see? Did you go out to see a tall grass moving in the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>What did you go out to see? A man wearing fine clothes? People who wear fine clothes and have nice things live in kings houses.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to come and eat with him. So Jesus went into the Pharisees house and sat down to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>In that city was a bad woman. When she knew that Jesus was eating at the Pharisees house, she came and brought a bottle of oil. It was oil that smelled very sweet and cost much money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>She stood behind Jesus by his feet, and she was crying. She began to wash his feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. Then she kissed his feet and put oil on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>The Pharisee who had asked Jesus to his house saw this. He said to himself, If this man were a prophet of God, he would know what kind of woman is touching him. She is a bad woman.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>Soon after this, Jesus went through the cities and towns. He told the people Gods word about the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve disciples were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>Some women were also with him. They had bad spirits and had been sick. But they had been healed. One was Mary, called Magdalene. Seven bad spirits had gone out of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>Another one was Joanna, the wife of Chuza, who worked for Herod. Another one was Susanna. And there were many others who gave what they could to help him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>Many people came to him from many towns. Then he told them a story.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>He said, A man went out to sow his seed. As he sowed it, some seed fell on the road.  People stepped on the seed. Birds ate it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>Some seed fell on the stony ground. It grew but soon died because the place was too dry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>Some seed fell among the weeds. The weeds grew up and made the new plants die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>But some seed fell on good ground and it grew well. Those plants gave a hundred times as much grain as the man sowed. When Jesus had said this, he called out, Everyone who has ears to hear, listen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>His disciples asked Jesus what this story meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>He said to them, You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of God. But other people must have stories. They will look, but they will not see. They will hear, but they will not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now here is what the story means. The seed is Gods word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>Some seeds fell on the road. They are like the people who hear the word of God. Then the devil comes and takes the word out of their hearts. He does not want them to believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>Some seeds fell on the stones. They are like people who are glad when they hear the word. But it does not go down deep into their hearts. They believe for a short time. But when they have trouble they stop believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>Some seeds fell among the weeds. They are like people who hear the word. But they think about the things of this world. They want to get money and things to be happy in this life. As they go on in life, these things push the message out of their hearts and no good comes from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>Some seeds fell on good ground. They are like people who hear the word and remember it. Their hearts are honest and good. These people keep on believing, and much good comes from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>No person lights a lamp and covers it with a basket or puts it under a bed. But he puts it on the place for a lamp. Then people who come in can see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>Everything that is hidden will be seen. Everything that is secret will be known and come out to be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>So take care how you listen. Anyone who has something will get more. But he who does not have anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>The mother of Jesus and his brothers came to him. They could not reach him because there were so many people around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>Someone told him, Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to talk to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But he said to them, These people who hear the word of God and do it, they are my mother and my brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples. He said to them, Let us cross over to the other side of the sea. So they started out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>While they were going, Jesus was sleeping. A bad storm came on the sea. Water was coming into the boat, and they were in trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>The disciples came to Jesus and woke him. They shouted, Master! Master! We will die!  Jesus woke and said to the wind and the water, Stop! They stopped. Then all was quiet</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>He said to the disciples, Why do you not believe God? They were afraid and surprised.  They said to each other, What kind of man is this? He tells the wind and the sea what to do and they obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarene people. Their country is on the other side of the sea from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>As Jesus got out of the boat a man met him from the town. He had bad spirits in him. He had not worn clothes for a long time. He did not live in a house, but among the graves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>When he saw Jesus, he screamed loudly and bowed down in front of him. He called out loud, Jesus, Son of the Highest One! What do you want to do to me? I beg you, do not hurt me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>He said this because Jesus had told the bad spirit to come out of the man. Many times the spirit had taken hold of the man. People had guarded him. They had tied him with chains and strong ropes. But he broke the chains and ropes. The bad spirit drove him into the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>Jesus asked him, What is your name? He answered, My name is An Army. He said this because many bad spirits had gone into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>The spirits begged Jesus not to send them away to the big hole that has no bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Many pigs were feeding on the hill there. The spirits begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs. Jesus let them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>The spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs. They ran fast down the steep hill into the sea. They died in the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>The men who cared for the pigs saw what happened. They ran and told it to the people in the town and in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>The people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus. They saw the man from whom the bad spirits had gone. He was sitting near the feet of Jesus. He had clothes on and was not crazy any more. The people were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>Those who had seen it told the people how the man had been saved from the bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>All the people in the country around the Gadarenes asked Jesus to go away from them to some other place. They were very much afraid. So Jesus got into a boat and went back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>The man from whom the bad spirits had gone begged to go with him. But Jesus sent him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>He said, Go home and tell the people what God has done for you. So the man went away and told the people all through the town what Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>When Jesus came back, the people were very glad to see him. They were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>A man named Jairus came to him. He was a ruler in the meeting house. He bowed down in front of Jesus and begged him to come to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>He had only one daughter She was about twelve years old. And she was dying. Many people went with Jesus and pushed against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>A woman among them had a sickness for twelve years. She was bleeding all the time.  She had given all her money to the doctors, but no one had been able to heal her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>She came behind Jesus and touched his clothes. The bleeding stopped right away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>Jesus said, Who touched me? Everyone said, Not I! Peter said, Master, the people are all around you and push you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>But Jesus said, Someone touched me. I know that power to heal went out from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>The woman saw that he knew about her. So she came trembling and bowed down in front of him. She told him in front of all the people why she had touched him. She told him that she had been healed right away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>Jesus said to her, Daughter, you were healed because you believed. Go and do not be troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While he was still talking, a man came from the rulers house. He said, Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the Teacher any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>Jesus heard it. He said, Do not fear. Only believe and she will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>When Jesus came to the house, he did not let the people go in with him. The only people he let go in were Peter, John and James, and the girls father and mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>All the people were crying and making a lot of noise because she had died. But he said,  Do not cry. She is not dead, but sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>They laughed at him because they knew she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>He took her hand and called out, Little girl, get up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>Her life came back and she got up right away. He told them to give her something to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>Her parents were very much surprised. Jesus said, Do not tell anyone what has happened.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>Jesus called his twelve disciples together. He gave them power over all the bad spirits,  and power to heal sick people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>He sent them out to tell people about the kingdom of God and to heal sick people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>He said, Take nothing with you for your trip. Do not take a walking stick, or a bag, or food, or money. And do not take two shirts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.4'>When you go into a certain house, stay there until you leave the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>Some people might not take you in. When you leave that town, shake the dust off your feet. That will be a sign to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>The disciples left and went through the towns. They told the good news and healed people everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Herod the ruler heard about all that was happening. He did not know what to think.  Some people said John the Baptizer had risen from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>Some people said Elijah had come back. And other people said that one of the old prophets of God had risen from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>Herod said, I cut off Johns head. Now who is this man of whom I hear such things? He wanted to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>When the apostles came back, they told Jesus all they had done. He took them away with him and they went by themselves to a town called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But the people found out and they followed him. He was glad to see them and talked to them about Gods kingdom. He healed those who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>When it was late in the day, the twelve disciples came to him. They said, Send the people away so they can go to the towns and the farms to sleep and get something to eat.  This is a lonely place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>But Jesus said to them, You give them food to eat. They said, All we have is five loaves of bread and two fish. Shall we go and buy food for all these people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>There were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, Tell the people to sit down in groups of fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>They did what he said, and they made all the people sit down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>He took the five loaves of bread and the two fish. He looked up to heaven and thanked God for them. Then he broke the bread. He gave it to the disciples to give to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>They all ate and had enough. They picked up twelve baskets full of pieces that were left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>One day Jesus was alone talking to God. His disciples were there too. He asked them,  Who do people say I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>They answered, Some people say you are John the Baptizer. Others say you are Elijah.  And others say that one of the old prophets of God has risen from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>Jesus said, But who do you say I am? Peter answered, You are the Christ sent by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>Jesus said to them, Do not tell this to anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>Then he went on to say, The Son of Man will have much trouble. The leaders of the people, the chief priests, and the scribes will not believe him. He will be killed. On the third day he will be raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>And He said to all the people, If anyone wants to come with me, he must leave what he himself wants to do. Every day he must take up his cross &lt;FI&gt;be ready to die&lt;Fi&gt; and come with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>Anyone who tries to keep his life will lose it. And anyone who gives up his life for my sake will find it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.25'>What good will it do a man if he gets the whole world for himself but loses his life or spoils it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>If anyone is ashamed of me and the things I say, the Son of man will be ashamed of that person when he comes. The Son of man will come with his holy angels and be great like his Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>I tell you the truth. Some people are standing here who will not die before they see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>About eight days after saying these things, Jesus went up on a hill to talk with God. He took Peter, John, and James with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>As he was talking with God, he was changed. His face was different. His clothes became very white and shining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And then two men were talking with Jesus. They were Moses and Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>Light was shining from them. They talked about his leaving this world. That would happen when he was in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>Peter and the others were very sleepy. They woke up and saw the light shining from Jesus. And they saw the two men standing with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>When the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, Master, it is good for us to be here.  Let us make three places here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. Peter did not know what he was saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>As he said this, a cloud came over them. They were very much afraid when the cloud came around them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>A voice in the cloud said, This is my dear Son. Listen to him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>The talking stopped. Then Jesus was left alone. The disciples did not say anything. They did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>The next day they came down the hill. Many people met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>One man among them called out, Teacher, I beg you, look at my son. He is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>A bad spirit takes hold of him and he screams. It throws him around and makes him foam at his mouth. It beats him badly and does not want to leave him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>I begged your disciples to drive the bad spirit out, but they could not do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>Jesus said, You people today do not believe. You have turned away from God. How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>While he was coming, the bad spirit knocked him down and threw him around. Jesus told the spirit to stop. He healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>All the people were surprised to see that God has so much power. While the people were wondering about everything Jesus did, he talked to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>He said, Listen well to what I say. The Son of Man will be given over to men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they did not understand what he said. The meaning was hidden from them so they would not understand it. And they were afraid to ask him about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>The disciples started talking among themselves. They quarrelled about which of them was the greatest person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he took a child and put him by his side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>Then he said, If anyone takes in a child like this for my sake, he takes in me. And if anyone takes in me, he takes in the one who sent me. The one who takes the least or lowest place among you is the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>John answered, Master, we saw a man driving bad spirits out of people. He was using your name. We told him to stop because he is not one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>But Jesus said, Do not stop him. Anyone who is not against you is on your side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>The time was near for Jesus to be taken up to heaven. Then he started off for Jerusalem.  He sent messengers ahead of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>They went to one of the towns of the Samaritan people to get ready for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>But the people would not take him in because he was going to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>When the disciples James and John saw that, they said, Lord, do you want us to ask for fire to come down from the sky and burn them up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But he turned and said to them, Stop that! You do not think about what kind of spirit you are showing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>The Son of Man did not come to kill people, but to save them. And they went on to another town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>As they went along on the road, a man said to him, I will go anywhere you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>Jesus said, Foxes have holes to live in. Birds have nests. But the Son of Man has no place to lie down to rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>Jesus said to another man who followed him, Come with me. But the man said, Lord,  let me go first and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>Jesus said to him, Let those who are dead bury their own dead people. As for you, go and tell people about Gods kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>Another man said to Jesus, Sir, I will go with you. But let me go first to my home and tell them I am going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>Jesus said to him, Any person who starts doing something and then keeps looking back is not fit for the kingdom of God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.10'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.1'>After this the Lord chose seventy other men. He sent them ahead of him, two by two. He sent them to every town and village that he was going to visit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.2'>He said to them, The harvest is much, but there are not many people to gather it. So talk to the Lord of this harvest and ask him to send out people to his harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.3'>Go on your way now. I am sending you out among people. You will be like sheep among bad animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.4'>Do not take money, or a bag, or shoes. And do not stop to talk with anyone on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.5'>When you go into a house, first say, "May God give peace to this family."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.13'>Chorazin, you will have trouble! Bethsaida, you will have trouble! If the big works I did in you had been done in the cities of Tyre and Sidon, the people there would have stopped doing bad things long ago. They would wear the clothes people wear to show they are sad, and would sit in ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.14'>But on the day when people are judged you will be punished more than the people in the cities of Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.15'>Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the sky? No, you will go down to the place of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.16'>Anyone who listens to you listens to me. Anyone who does not believe you does not believe me. Anyone who does not believe me does not believe the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.17'>The seventy men Jesus had sent out came back very happy. They said, Lord, even the bad spirits obey us when we talk to them in your name!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.18'>Jesus said to them, I saw Satan fall from the sky like lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.19'>I have given you power over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will hurt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.20'>Do not be glad that the bad spirits obey you. But be glad that your names are written in the book in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.21'>At that same time the Holy Spirit made Jesus very happy. Jesus said, Father, you are Lord of heaven and earth. I thank you because you have hidden these things from people who are wise and know many things. But you have shown them to people who are like children. Yes, Father. That was the way you wanted it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.22'>My Father has given everything to me. No one knows who the Son is but the Father. No one knows who the Father is but the Son and those to whom the Son wants to show him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.23'>Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said to them alone, God is blessing the eyes of people who see what you see!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.24'>I tell you this. Many prophets and kings wanted to see the things you see. But they did not see them. They wanted to hear the things you hear. But they did not hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.25'>A man who taught Gods law stood up and asked Jesus a question to try him out.  Teacher, he said. What must I do so that I will live for ever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.26'>Jesus said to him, What does the law say? What do you read there?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.28'>Jesus said, That is the right answer. Do that and you will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.29'>But the man wanted to prove that he was all right. So he said to Jesus, Who is my neighbour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.30'>Jesus answered, A man was going from Jerusalem to Jericho. Bad men caught him on the road. They took his clothes and beat him. Then they went away and left him half dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.31'>A priest happened to be going down that road. He saw the man but he passed by on the other side of the road.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.33'>A man from the country of Samaria was going on that road also, and came to the place.  He saw the man and wanted to share in his troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.34'>He went to him and tied up the sores he had from the beating. He washed them with oil and wine. Then he lifted the man up and set him on his own animal to ride. He took him to the house for strangers. And he cared for him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.37'>He said, The man who was kind to him. Jesus said, Go and do as he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.38'>Jesus and his disciples went on their way. They came to a town. A woman named Martha took him into her home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.39'>She had a sister named Mary. Mary sat near the feet of Jesus and she listened to what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.40'>But Martha was very busy doing many things for Jesus. She came to Jesus and said,  Lord, my sister has left me to do all the work. Do you not care? Tell her to come and help me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.28'>God dresses the grass in the fields so it looks nice. It is in the field one day and the next day it is burned. If God dresses the grass like that, he cares much more that you have clothes to wear. You do not believe in God very much!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.47'>A servant knew what his master wanted. But he was not ready. He did not do what his master wanted him to do. So he will be beaten much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.48'>But if a servant did not know and did something bad, he will be beaten only a little. To whom much has been given, from him much will be asked. When people give much to anyone, they will ask more from him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.14.29'>If you do not have enough money, you will not be able to finish it after you have made the foundation. Then all the people who see it will laugh at you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.30'>They will say, "This man started to build a house and could not finish it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.31'>When a king goes to fight against another king, he sits down first and thinks about the matter. He will ask himself, "Can I fight him with ten thousand soldiers? He has twenty thousand soldiers."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.15.1'>The tax collectors and bad people all came close to Jesus to hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.2'>The Pharisees and scribes did not like it. And they said to each other, This man is glad to have bad people come. He eats with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.3'>So Jesus told them this story.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.4'>He said, Which one of you will not do this? A man has a hundred sheep. He loses one of them. He leaves the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and he goes to look for the one that is lost. He looks until he finds it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.5'>And when he has found it, he is very glad. He carries it on his back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.6'>When he comes home, he calls his friends and neighbours to come. He says, "Be glad with me! I have found my lost sheep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.7'>I tell you, the angels in heaven will be glad like that when one bad person stops doing wrong things. The angels will be more glad about that one person than about ninety-nine good people who do not need to change their ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.8'>What woman will not do this? She has ten pieces of silver money. If she loses one of them, she lights a lamp and sweeps the house. She looks for the money until she finds it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.9'>When she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbours to come. She says, "Be glad with me! I have found the piece of money I lost."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.10'>I tell you, the angels of God will be glad like that when one bad person stops doing wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.11'>Jesus also said, A man had two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.12'>The younger son said to his father, "Father, give me my part of what will belong to me."  So his father divided all he had between the two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.13'>After a few days, the younger son packed up his things. He left home and went to a country far away. There he spent his money in foolish and wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.14'>He spent everything he had. There was no food in that country for a long time. He began to be in trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.15'>So he went to stay with a man in the country who had a farm. The man sent him out to his farm to feed the pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.16'>He would have been glad to eat the food the pigs ate. But no one gave him anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.17'>Then he started to get sense. He said, "My father has many men who work for him.  They have plenty of food. But here I am dying because I have nothing to eat!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.18'>I will get up and go to my father. I will say to him, "Father I have been a bad son. I have done wrong to God in heaven and to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.19'>I am not good enough now to be called your son. Let me be like one of these men who work for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.20'>So he got up and went to his father. While he was still far away, his father saw him. He loved him and wanted to share in his troubles. He ran and put his arms around him and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.21'>The son said to him, "Father, I have been a bad son. I have done wrong to God in heaven and to you. I am not good enough now to be called your son. Let me be like one of these men who work for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.22'>But his father said to his servants, "Go quickly and bring the best clothes. Dress him. Put a ring on his hand. Put shoes on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.23'>Bring the fat calf and kill it. Let us have a feast and a good time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.24'>This is my son. He was dead and now he is alive again. He was lost and is found." And they began to have a good time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.25'>The older son was out on the farm. When he came home and was near the house, he heard music and dancing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.26'>He called one of the servants and said, "What is going on?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.27'>The servant said, "Your brother has come home. Your father has killed the fat young cow because your brother is home and he is well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.28'>But the older son was angry. He would not go into the house. His father came out and begged him to come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.29'>But the son said to his father, "Look. I have worked hard for you for many years. I have always done everything you told me to do. And yet you never even gave me a young goat to make a feast with my friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.30'>But now this son of yours has come back. He has spent all your money and was with bad women. And yet you kill the fat calf for him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.31'>The father said, "Son you have always been with me. And all that I have is yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.32'>But now we should have a good time and be happy. Your brother was dead and now he is alive again. He was lost and is found."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.16'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.1'>Jesus also talked to his disciples. He said, A rich man had a manager in charge of his things. People told the rich man that the manager was wasting his things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.2'>he called the manager and asked him, "What is this I hear about you? Tell me what you have done. You cannot be my manager any more."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.3'>Then the manager thought to himself, "What will I do? My master is taking my work away from me. I am not strong enough to go out and dig. I am ashamed to beg.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.4'>I know what I will do. Then, when I lose my job, these people will take me into their own homes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.5'>So he called to him everyone who owed his master something. He asked the first man,  "How much do you owe my master?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.6'>He answered, "A hundred tins of oil." The manager said, "Take your paper. Sit down right now and write on it fifty."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.7'>Then he asked the next man, "How much do you owe?" He said, "A hundred bags of grain." The manager said, "Take your paper and write on it eighty."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.8'>Then the master praised the manager who did wrong. He praised him because he did what was wise. The people of this world are wiser than the people who have the Light.  They know how to get along with people like themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.9'>I tell you this. Money may be a wrong thing, but use it to make friends for yourselves.  Then when your money is spent, they will be glad to see you come into that place where people live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.10'>Anyone who can be trusted in a little matter can also be trusted in a big matter. Anyone who does wrong in a very little matter will do wrong also in a big matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.11'>So if you could not be trusted to use money, which is bad, who will trust you to use true riches?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.12'>If you could not be trusted with what belonged to another person, who will give you something for yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.13'>No servant can work for two masters. He will hate one and love the other. Or he will obey one and despise the other. You cannot work for both God and money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.14'>The Pharisees loved money. They heard all these things. They made fun of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.15'>He said to them, You try to make men think you are all right. But God knows your hearts. What men think is fine, God hates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.16'>The Law and the Prophets gave Gods word until John came. Since then, the good news of Gods kingdom has been told. And now everyone tries hard to get into the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.17'>It would be easier to take away the sky and the earth than for the smallest part of the law to fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.18'>If a man sends away his wife and marries another woman, he commits adultery. And if the man marries a woman who has been sent away by her husband, he commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.19'>There was a rich man who dressed and lived like a king every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.20'>A poor man named Lazarus was put at his door. He had many sores on his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.21'>He wanted to eat the pieces of food that fell from the rich mans table. Dogs came and licked his sores.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.22'>The poor man died. Angels carried him to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.23'>He was in great pain in the world of dead people. He looked up and saw Abraham far away. With him was Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.24'>He called out, "Father Abraham, help me! Send Lazarus to dip his finger in some water and cool my tongue. This fire is very hot for me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.25'>But Abraham said to him, "Son, remember this. You had a good time when you were living. Lazarus had a bad time when he was living. But now he is happy here and you are in pain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.26'>But that is not all. A wide hole is between you and us. No one can go from here to you if he wanted to. And no one can come from where you are to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.27'>The rich man said, "Then, father, I beg you, send Lazarus to my fathers house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.28'>I have five brothers there. Tell him to talk to them so that they will not come to this place where there is pain."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.29'>But Abraham said, "They have Moses and the Prophets. They can listen to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.30'>He answered, "No, father Abraham! But if a man who had died went to them, they would stop their wrong ways."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.31'>Abraham said, "If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, then they will not believe, even if a man were raised from death."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.17.1'>Jesus said to his disciples, People will make other people do wrong. But the person who makes another person do wrong will have trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.2'>A big stone should be tied around his neck and then he should be thrown into the sea.  That would be better for him than to make one of these little children do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.3'>Take care! If your brother does something bad, tell him what he has done. If he is sorry,  then forgive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.4'>Maybe he will do wrong to you seven times in one day. But if he comes to you seven times in one day and says, "I am sorry for what I did," then you must forgive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.5'>The apostles said to the Lord, Help us to believe more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.6'>The Lord said, If you believe as much as a little mustard seed, then you can say to this tree, "Come up by the roots and plant yourself in the sea." And it would obey you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.7'>If your servant is working in the field or taking care of sheep, what will you say to him when he comes in from the field? Will you say, "Come now and sit down to eat"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.8'>No, you will say, "Get my food ready. Get ready to wait on me. I will eat and drink. After that, then you may eat and drink."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.9'>Will you thank the servant for doing what you told him to do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.10'>It is the same with you. When you have done all you were told to do, you should say,  "We are servants. We have not done a big thing. We have only done what we should do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.11'>Jesus was going on the road to Jerusalem. He went between the countries of Samaria and Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.12'>When he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy came to him. They stood far away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.13'>And they called out, Jesus, Master, help us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.14'>When Jesus saw them, he said to them, Go and let the priests look at you. While they were going, they were healed of the leprosy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.15'>One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back. He praised God with a loud voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.16'>He bowed down in front of Jesus and thanked him. He was a man from the country of Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.17'>Then Jesus asked, Were not ten people healed? Where are the other nine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.18'>Is this stranger the only one who has come back to praise God?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.17.21'>People will not be able to say, "Look, here it is!" or "There it is! That is because the kingdom of God is inside you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.17.27'>People ate and drank. They married and gave their daughters to be married. All this went on until the day when Noah went into his house built on a boat. Then there was much water and all the people outside the boat died.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.7'>When the people whom God has chosen call to him day and night, he will save them from their enemies. He may let them wait a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.8'>But I tell you, he will save them from their enemies soon. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find any people who believe in him?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.15'>People brought even small children to Jesus. They wanted him to put his hands on them.  When the disciples saw it, they tried to stop the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.16'>But Jesus called them to him and said, Let the children come to me. Do not try to stop them. The kingdom of God belongs to people like them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.17'>I tell you the truth. If anyone does not believe in the kingdom of God like a child, he will never go in.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.43'>Right then he was able to see. He went with Jesus and he praised God. All the people saw it and they all praised God too.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.19'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.1'>Jesus came to the city of Jericho and was passing through it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.2'>A man named Zacchaeus was there. He was the head tax collector, and he was a rich man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.3'>He wanted to see who Jesus was but he could not see him because he was a short man and there were many people around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.4'>So he ran ahead and climbed into a tree to see Jesus, for he was coming that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>When Jesus came to the tree, he looked up. He said, Zacchaeus, come down right now.  I must stay at your house today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.6'>So Zacchaeus came down right then. He was glad to have Jesus come in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.7'>When all the people saw this, they did not like it. They said, He has gone to visit a bad man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.8'>Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, Look, Lord, I will give to the poor people half of all I have. And if I have cheated anyone, I will give him back four times as much as I took.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.9'>Jesus said to him, The head of this house has been saved today! He also is a son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.10'>The Son of Man came to look for and to save those who are lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>While they were listening to this, he started to tell them a story. He did so because they were near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God would begin right away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>So he said, A man who belonged to a respected family went to a country far away. He went to get power to rule. Then he was going to come back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>Before he left, he called ten of his servants. He gave each of them some money. He said,  "Go and trade with this money until I come back."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.14'>His people hated him. They chose some men and sent them after him to tell the king,  "We do not want this man to rule over us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.15'>But he was given the power to rule and came back. Then he called the servants to whom he had given the money. He wanted to know how much money each one had made by trading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.16'>The first one came to him and said, "Sir, your money has made ten times more money."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>The ruler said, "You have done well. You are a good servant. You will rule over ten cities because you have done well with a very small thing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.18'>The second one came to him and said, "Sir, your money has made five times more money."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.19'>The ruler said, "You will rule over five cities."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.20'>Then another servant came and said, "Sir, here is your money. I hid it in a cloth and kept it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.21'>I was afraid of you. You are a hard man. You take in where you put nothing out. You gather where you did not plant."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.22'>The ruler said "You bad servant! I will judge you by your own words. You knew that I was a hard man! You knew that I take in where I put nothing out. You knew that I gather where I did not plant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.23'>Why did you not put my money in the bank? Then when you came home I would have had my money with interest."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.24'>Some men were standing there. He said to them, "Take the money from him. Give it to the man who has ten times as much."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.25'>They said, "Sir, he has ten times as much already!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.26'>The ruler said, "I tell you. Anyone who has some will get more. But he who does not have anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.27'>But where are those people who hate me and did not want me to rule over them? Bring them here and kill them right here in front of me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.28'>When Jesus had said this, he went on ahead of them towards Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.29'>He came near Bethphage and Bethany by the hill called the Mount of Olives. Then he sent two of his disciples ahead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.30'>He said, Go into the village in front of you. As soon as you go in, you will find an animal tied up. No one has ever sat on it. Untie it and bring it to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.31'>If anyone asks you, "Why are you untying it?" tell him, "The Lord needs it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.32'>They went and found it just as Jesus had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>When they were untying the animal, the men who owned it asked them, Why are you untying the animal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>They said, The Lord needs it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.35'>They brought it to Jesus and laid their coats on it. Then they put Jesus on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>As he was riding along, people spread their coats on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>He came near the top of the hill called the Mount of Olives. Then all the people who believed in him began to be happy. They sang out loudly, and praised God in a loud voice for all the big works they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>They said, God bless the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven where God is praised!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.39'>Some of the Pharisees who were among the people said to Jesus, Teacher, tell your disciples to stop saying that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.40'>Jesus answered, I tell you, if they do not speak like this the stones will call out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>When Jesus came near, he saw the city. His heart was very sad and he cried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.42'>He said, I wish you knew today what things would give you peace! But now you do not see what they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.43'>The time will come when the people who hate you will put a wall all around you. They will shut you up and keep you in on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.44'>They will break you down to the ground. They will kill the people within you. They will not leave one stone of your houses on top of another. That will happen because you did not know the time when God was ready to help you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.45'>Jesus went into the temple. He began to drive out the people who were buying and selling in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.46'>He said to them, It is written, "My house shall be a place where people talk with God."  But you have made it a place for people who steal!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.47'>He taught in the temple every day. The chief priests, scribes and the leaders of the people wanted to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.48'>But they did not find any way they could do it. All the people stayed around to hear what Jesus said.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>One day Jesus was teaching the people in the temple. He was telling them Gods good news. The chief priests and the scribes came to him with the leaders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>They said to him, Tell us what right you have to do these things. Who gave you the right to do them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>He answered, I will ask you a question also. Tell me this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>Who gave John the right to baptise people? Did God or did men give it to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>They talked it over together. They said, If we say, "God gave John the right to do it," he will say, "Then why did you not believe him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>But if we say, "Men gave him the right to do it," then the people will kill us with stones.  They believe that John was a prophet of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>So they answered Jesus, We do not know who gave him the right to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>Then Jesus said to them, Neither will I tell you what right I have to do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>Then Jesus began to tell the people this story. A man planted a farm. He let some men use the farm. They paid him money for the rent. Then he went to a country far away and stayed a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>At harvest time the owner sent one of his servants to the men who used the farm. He wanted to have some fruit from the farm. But the men beat the servant and sent him away without any fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>So he sent another servant. They beat this one also, and did wrong things to him. And they sent him away without any fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>He sent a servant the third time. They hurt this one also and threw him out of the farm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>Then the man who owned the farm said, "What shall I do? I will send my dear son.  Maybe they will respect him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the men saw him they said to each other, "This is the one who will have everything when his father dies. Let us kill him. Then everything will belong to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>They dragged him off the farm and killed him. What will the man who owned the farm do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come back and kill those men. And he will give the farm to other men to use.  When the chief priests and scribes heard this, they said, May it not be so!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>But Jesus looked right at them. He said, What about this writing then? "The stone which the builders would not use is now the chief corner stone."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces. But if that stone falls on anyone, it will crush him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>The scribes and the chief priests wanted to catch Jesus right then but they feared the people. They understood that he had told this story against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>So they watched for a chance to catch him. And they sent men to spy on him. These men acted as if they were good men. They did this because they wanted to catch him in something that he said. They wanted to give him over to the ruler who would judge and punish him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>So they asked Jesus, Teacher, we know that you talk and teach what is right. You do not fear any person. But you teach the true way of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it right to pay money as taxes to Caesar or is it not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>He knew they were trying to get him into trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>So he said, Show me a piece of money. Whose picture and name are on it? They said,  Caesars</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>Then he said to them, So give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>They were not able to catch him in anything he said in front of the people. They were surprised at his answer and they could not say anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Some of the Sadducees came to Jesus. (They say that people do not rise from death.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>They came to ask Jesus a question. Teacher, they said, Moses gave us this law: "If a man dies and leaves a wife but no children, then his brother must marry the wife and raise a family for his brother."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>There were seven brothers. The first one married. He died and left no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>The second one married the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>Then the third one married her. All seven brothers married her. They all had no children and they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Last of all, the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>Now then, when people rise from death, whose wife will she be? All seven of them had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>Jesus said to them, Men and women in this world marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>But men and women who are good enough to have a place in the next world and to be raised from death do not marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>They cannot die again. They are like angels. They are Gods children because they have been raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>Even Moses showed that people do rise from death. It is in his book where we read about the small tree which burned. Moses says that the Lord is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>He is not the God of dead people, but of living people. All people are alive to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>Some of the scribes said to him, Teacher, what you say is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>After that, people were afraid to ask him any more questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>But Jesus asked them, How can people say that Christ is Davids son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>, fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>David himself says in the book of the Psalms, "The LORD said to my Lord, sit beside me until I make you master over your enemies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>So David calls Christ his Lord. How can Christ be Davids son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>Then Jesus talked to his disciples while all the people could hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>He said, Take care. Do not let the scribes fool you. They like to walk about dressed in long gowns. They want people to greet them in the market. They want to have the front seats in the meeting houses. They want to sit in the best places at feasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>They take away the homes of women whose husbands are dead. They cover up their wrong ways by talking to God a long time. They will be punished more!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.21'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.1'>Jesus looked around in the temple. He saw the place where the people put in their money. Rich people were putting in their money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.2'>And he saw a poor woman whose husband was dead. She put in two small pieces of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.3'>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. This poor woman has given more than all the other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.4'>All these people had plenty of money and they gave only a part of it. She was poor and she gave everything she had. She has nothing left to live on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.5'>Some people were talking about how nice the temple looked. They talked about the fine stones and the things people gave to make the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.6'>Jesus said, You see these things. Not one stone here will be left on top of another. They will all be thrown down!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.7'>They asked him, Teacher, when will this happen? What will be the sign when these things are going to be done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.8'>He said, Take care. Do not let anyone fool you. Many men will come in my name. They will say, "I am Christ." And they will say, "The time is now." Do not go after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.9'>When you hear about wars and fighting, do not fear. These things must happen first, but it is not the end right away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.10'>Then he said, One tribe will fight against another tribe. And one country will fight against another country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.11'>In some places the earth will shake very much. In many places the people will have no food to eat. And many people will be sick. There will be things to make people fear.  There will be big signs in the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.12'>But before all these things happen, people will catch you and trouble you. They will take you to the meeting houses to be judged. They will put you in prison. They will take you to kings and rulers because you are true to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.13'>This will be a chance for you to talk about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.14'>So do not trouble your minds about what you will say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.15'>I will give you words and sense. All those who are against you will not be able to answer your words or say they are not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.16'>Even your parents, brothers, family people, and friends will give you over to trouble.  They will kill some of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.17'>All people will hate you because you are true to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.18'>But you will not lose one hair from your heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.19'>If you keep on being true to me, you will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.20'>When you see soldiers all around Jerusalem, then you will know that it will soon be broken down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.21'>Then the people in Judea must go quickly to the hills. Those who are in the city must leave it. Those who are in the country must not come into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.22'>Those will be days of punishment. All that has been written in the holy writings must happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.23'>In those days it will be very hard for women who are to have a child. It will be very hard for mothers who have babies. There will be big trouble on the earth. God will show his anger to these people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.24'>They will be killed by swords or long knives. They will be taken away as prisoners to every country. Jerusalem will be broken down by people who are not Jews. They will walk over it until the end of their allowed time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.25'>There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars. And there will be much trouble for the people on earth. They will not know what to do. It will be like the sound of big waves of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.26'>Men will be weak with fear. They will be afraid of the things that will be happening to the world. The powers in the sky will be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.27'>Then people will see the sign of the Son of Man in a cloud. He will have much power and will be very great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.28'>When these things begin to happen, look up. Lift up your heads. You will soon be free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.29'>Jesus told them a story. He said, Look at a fig tree. Look at all the trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.30'>As soon as you see the leaves coming, you know that it will soon be the warm time of the year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.31'>It is the same way when you see all these things happening. You will know that the kingdom of God is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.32'>I tell you the truth. People who are living then will not die before all these things happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.33'>The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.34'>But take care. Do not think too much about eating, drinking, and things in this life. If you do, that day will come and catch you like a trap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.35'>That day will come to all people who are living on the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.36'>Watch all the time. Ask God to make you strong to do right so that you will not go through all these things that are going to happen. Ask him to make you able to stand in front of the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.37'>Jesus taught in the temple every day. But at night he went out and stayed on the hill called the Mount of Olives.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.22'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.1'>It was near the time for the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. This is called the Passover Feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.2'>The chief priests and the scribes planned how to kill Jesus. But they feared the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.3'>Satan came into the heart of Judas. Judas was one of the twelve disciples. His other name was Iscariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>Judas went away and talked things over with the chief priests and captains. He told them how he could help them catch Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>They were glad, and they said they would give him money for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>He agreed. He watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus when there were not too many people around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>It was the day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. The sheep had to be killed for the Passover Feast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying to them, Go and get the Passover Feast ready for us to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.9'>They asked, Where do you want us to get it ready?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.10'>He said, When you go into the city, a man carrying a pot of water will meet you. Follow him into the house where he goes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.11'>Tell the master of the house, "The Teacher says, Where is the room where I can eat the Passover Feast with my disciples?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.12'>He will show you a large room upstairs. It will be all fixed up. Make it ready there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.13'>So they went and found everything just the way Jesus had said. Then they made the Passover food ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>When it was time to eat, he sat down at the table and the apostles sat down with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.15'>He said to them, I have wanted very much to eat this Passover Feast with you before my troubles come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.16'>I tell you this. I will not eat it again until the great feast in the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.17'>He took the cup and thanked God. He said, Take this. All of you drink from this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.18'>I tell you this. I will not drink from the fruit of the vine again until the kingdom of God comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.19'>He took some bread. He thanked God for it and broke it. He gave it to the disciples and said, This is my body, which is given for you. When you do this, then remember me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.20'>In the same way he took the cup after they had eaten. He said, This cup is the new agreement made by my blood. It is given for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.21'>There is a man who will give me over to my enemies. His hand is here at the table with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.22'>The Son of Man will go on as it was planned for him. But the man who gives him over will have trouble!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.23'>The disciples began to ask each other, Which of us will do this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.24'>They started to quarrel among themselves about which of them was the greatest person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.25'>Jesus said to them, The kings of countries make their people obey them. Those who rule give themselves a good name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.26'>But it must not be so among you. The one who is greatest among you must be like the most unimportant. And the leader must be like one who helps others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.27'>Which man is greater, the man who sits at the table or the man who helps him? Is it not the man who sits at the table? But I am like the man who helps you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.28'>You have stayed with me through my troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.29'>My Father made me a ruler, and now I make you rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.30'>You will eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. You will sit on chief chairs or thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.31'>Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has asked to have all of you. He wants to shake you like grain with the cleaning fan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.32'>But I have talked to God about you, Simon, so that you will keep on believing in me. And when you come back, then help your brothers to be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.33'>Simon said, Lord, I will go with you, even to prison or to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.34'>Jesus said, I tell you this, Peter. This very day, before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.35'>Jesus said to them, When I sent you out to the towns, I told you not to carry a money bag, or a bag, or shoes. Did you ever need anything at that time? They said, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.36'>He said, But this time, anyone who has money should take it and his bag too. Anyone who has no sword should sell his coat and buy one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.37'>The holy writings say, "He was counted as one of the bad people." And I tell you, that means me. And the things that are written about me must happen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.38'>The disciples said, Look, Lord, here are two swords. And he answered, That is enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>Then Jesus went out of the room and went to the hill called the Mount of Olives where he often went. His disciples went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>He said to them, Talk with God so that you will not do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>He went away from them about as far as a person can throw a stone. Then he kneeled down to talk with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>He said, Father, if you will, take this cup away from me. But do not do what I want but what you want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>Then an angel came to him from heaven and helped to make him strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>His heart was troubled very much. So he talked with God more than before. His sweat was like big drops of blood falling on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>He stopped talking with God and got up. He went to his disciples and found them sleeping because they were sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>He said to them, Why are you sleeping? Get up. Talk with God so that you will not do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>As Jesus was saying this, many men came. One of the twelve disciples, named Judas,  was leading the people. He came near Jesus to kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.48'>Jesus said to him, Judas, will you give over the Son of Man to his enemies with a kiss?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.49'>The disciples around Jesus saw what was going to happen. They said, Lord, shall we fight with our swords?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.50'>One of them hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.51'>Jesus said, Just let me do this. And he touched the mans ear and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>The chief priests, the captains of the temple, and the leaders of the people had come to catch Jesus. He said to them, Have you come to take me with swords and sticks, the way you catch a man who steals?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>I was with you every day in the temple. You did not try to catch me then. But this is your time now, the time of the power of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>The men caught Jesus and took him away to the high priests house. Peter followed them far behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>They made a fire in the yard and sat around it. Peter sat down with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>A woman saw Peter sitting by the fire. She looked at him and said, This man was with him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>But Peter said, Woman, I do not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>After a while, another person saw him and said, You are one of them also. But Peter said, Man, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>About an hour later another person said, Surely this man was with him. He comes from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are talking about. And right then, while he was talking, the cock called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered that the Lord had said to him, Before the cock calls in the morning, you will say three times that you do not know me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>Peter went out and cried very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>The men who guarded Jesus made fun of him and beat him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>They tied something over his eyes. Then they hit him in the face and said, Tell us if you know who hit you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And they said many other wrong things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>In the morning the leaders of the people, the chief priests and scribes met together. They took Jesus to their court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>They said, If you are the Christ, tell us. Jesus said, If I tell you, you will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>And if I ask you anything, you will not answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>From this time on the Son of Man will sit beside God who has all power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.70'>They all said, Then are you the Son of God?" He said, Yes, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.71'>They said, We do not need any more proof against him. We ourselves have heard what he said.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>Then all the people got up and took Jesus to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>They began to make a complaint against him. They said, This man is leading our people to do wrong. He says we should not pay taxes to Caesar. He says that he is Christ, a King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>Then Pilate asked Jesus, Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, Yes, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>Pilate said to the chief priests and to the people, I find nothing wrong in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they said all the more, He troubles the people by his teaching. He has been teaching people in all the country of Judea. He began in Galilee and has come as far as this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>When Pilate heard this, he asked, Is this man from Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>When he knew that he came from Herods country, he sent him to Herod. Herod was in Jerusalem at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>He was glad to see Jesus. He had heard about him. And he had wanted to see him for a long time. He was hoping that he would see Jesus do a big work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>He asked Jesus many questions. But Jesus did not answer him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>The chief priests and the scribes stood near. They brought strong complaints against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>Then Herod and his soldiers laughed at Jesus and made fun of him. He dressed him up in very fine clothes and sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>Herod and Pilate became friends that day. Before that, they had hated each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>Pilate then called the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>He said to them, You brought this man to me. You said he is leading your people to do wrong. I have asked questions here in front of you. I have found nothing wrong in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>Herod did the same. He sent him back to us. This man has done nothing for which he should die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>So I will beat him and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>At the feast Pilate always let one man go free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>But they all shouted, Kill this man! Let Barabbas go free for us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>(Barabbas had been put in prison because he led some people who had been fighting in the city. He had killed a man.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Pilate talked to the people again. He wanted to let Jesus go free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>But they shouted, Nail him to a cross! Nail him to a cross!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>Pilate said to them the third time, Why, what wrong thing has he done? I have not found any wrong thing for which he should die. So I will beat him and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they shouted all the more loudly, saying, Nail him to a cross! And Pilate gave in to their shouting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>So he said they could have it their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>He let the other man go free. (He was the one who had been put in prison because he fought and had killed a man. He was the one the people asked Pilate to let go free.) And Pilate did to Jesus what they wanted him to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>They took Jesus away. On the way, they caught a man who was coming in from the farms. His name was Simon. He was born in the country of Cyrene. They made him walk behind Jesus and carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>Many people followed him. Women cried and were sorry for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus turned to them and said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not cry for me. But cry for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>The time will come when people will say, "Happy are the women who have no children or who have never had a child."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then people will begin to say to the big hills, "Fall on us." They will say to the small hills,  "Hide us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>If this is what people do when the wood is new, what will they do when it is old?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>Two men were also led away to be killed with Jesus. They were bad men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>They came to the place called Calvary (the head bone.) There they nailed the two bad men to the crosses also. They put one man on the right side of Jesus and one man on the left side of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>Jesus said, Father, forgive them! They do not know what they are doing. The soldiers played a game to see how they should divide his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>The people stood around watching. But the rulers made fun of him. They said, He saved other people. He should save himself if he is Gods Christ, Gods chosen one!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>The soldiers made fun of him. They came and brought him wine to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>They said, If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>The sign that was put above Jesus head said, This is the King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>One of the bad men who was hanging there said wrong things against Jesus. He said If you are the Christ, why do you not save yourself and us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other bad man told him to stop. He said, Do you not even fear God? You are being punished just as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>It is right for us to be punished because we have done wrong things. But this man has done nothing bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>He said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when you become a King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus said to him, I tell you the truth. Today you will be with me in Gods garden of paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>About noontime the whole land became dark and stayed dark for three hours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>The sun did not shine. The big cloth that hung in the temple was torn into two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>Jesus called out loud, Father, I put my spirit into your hands! When he had said this, he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>The captain saw all this. Then he praised God. He said, Surely, this was a good man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>Many people were around there to look on. When they saw what happened, they all went home beating their chests &lt;FI&gt;because they were sad&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>All Jesus friends and the women who had come with him from Galilee stood far away.  They saw all of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>There was a man named Joseph. He was a member of the court. He was a good man who lived the right way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>He had not wanted the people to do what they did. He was looking for the kingdom of God. He was from a town of the Jews, called Arimathea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>He took the body down from the cross. He wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it in a grave cut in a rock. No one had ever been put in this grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>It was the day before the Sabbath. And it was almost time for the Sabbath to begin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>Some women had come with Jesus from Galilee. They followed and saw the grave where his body was put.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>Then they went back and got things ready to put on his body. These things were spices that smelled very nice, and sweet kinds of oil. On the Sabbath day they rested as the law said they should.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>On the first day of the week, early in the morning, the women went to the grave. They took with them the things they had made ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>They saw that the stone was rolled away from the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>So they went in. But they did not see the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>They were troubled about this. Then they saw two men standing near them. They were dressed in white clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>The women were afraid and bowed their faces down to the ground. The men said to them, Why do you look for a living person among dead people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here. He has risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>He said that the Son of Man would be given over to bad men. He would be nailed to a cross, and he would rise on the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>Then they remembered what he had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>They left the grave and went back. They told all these things to the eleven disciples and to all the other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>The women who told these things to the apostles were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women who were with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>But Peter got up and ran to the grave. He bowed down and looked in. He saw the linen clothes lying there, but nothing more. Then he left, wondering about what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>That same day, two of the disciples were going to the town called Emmaus. It was about two hours walk from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>They were talking together about all the things that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>While they were talking and asking each other questions, Jesus himself came and walked with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>But even though they saw him, they did not know who he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>Jesus asked them, What is this that you are talking about as you walk along looking so sad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>One of them named Cleophas answered him. He said, Are you a stranger in Jerusalem and do not know what has happened there these last days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>Jesus said, What things?" They said, All that has happened to Jesus of Nazareth. He was a prophet of God. He had power to do big works and to teach the people. He was respected by God and all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>Our chief priests and rulers gave him over to be punished by death, and they nailed him to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>But we were hoping that he was the one who would free the people of Israel. But that is not all. This is the third day since they did it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>Some of our women told us things that surprised us. Early this morning they were at the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>They did not find his body there. They came back and said that they saw angels. The angels told them that Jesus was living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>Some of us went to the grave. And they found everything just as the women said. But they did not see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>Then he said to them, You foolish men! Your hearts are slow to believe all that the prophets of God have said long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Christ had to have this trouble and go to the place where he will be great, did he not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Then he told them the meaning of all that Moses and all the prophets of God long ago had written about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>They came near the village to which they were going. It looked as if he was going on further.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>But they begged him not to go further. They said, Stay with us. It will soon be night. The day is almost finished. So he went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>He sat down at the table with them. Then he took the bread and thanked God for it. He broke it and gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>Then they saw who he was. They knew him. And then suddenly they could not see him any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>They said to each other, It was like a fire burning in our hearts when he talked to us on the road and told us the meaning of the holy writings!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>They got up right then and went back to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven disciples together. Some other people were with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>These people said, The Lord has really risen! He came to Simon!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>Then the men from Emmaus told them what had happened on the road. They told how they knew Jesus when he broke bread and gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>While they were telling them this, Jesus himself stood there with them. He said to them,  Peace to you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>They were troubled and afraid. They thought they were seeing a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>He said to them, Why are you troubled? Why do you wonder about these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>Look at my hands and my feet. You can see that it is I myself. Touch me with your hands and see. A spirit does not have a body and bones as you see I have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>They gave him a piece of cooked fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>He took the fish and ate it in front of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>Then he said, I told you this while I was with you. I told you that things were written about me in the books of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms. And I told you that all of these things must come true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>Then he taught them so that they understood the things in the holy writings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>He said, It is written that the Christ must have trouble. On the third day he will rise from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>Men will talk in his name to people in all countries. They will tell them to stop their wrong ways and ask to be forgiven. They will begin in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>You are the men who have seen these things, and will tell people about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>I will send you what the Father has promised to give you. So wait in the city of Jerusalem until you have been given power from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>Jesus led the disciples out as far as the town of Bethany. He put up his hands and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>While he was blessing them, he left them. He was taken up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>They bowed down and worshipped him. They were very happy and went back to Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He, the Word, was in the world. Yes, he even made the world. And yet the world did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came into the world that was his own, but his own people did not receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But there were people who did believe in his name. They did receive him. He gave all those who received him and believed him the right to become children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>They were born into Gods family by God. That is, they were not born into his family in the way a person is born into this world. It was not by any persons will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>The Word became man and he lived among us. We saw with our own eyes that he is great. He is great the way God the Father made his only Son great. We saw that he is full of loving kindness and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John talked about him. He called out saying, Here is the man I told you about. I said that the one who is coming after me is greater than I am, because he lived before I lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>He was full of loving kindness, and we have all received so much kindness from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>Moses gave the law, but Jesus Christ gave this loving kindness and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one has ever seen God. But his only Son is very near to his Fathers heart. He has told us plainly about God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>The leaders of the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem. They asked John, Who are you? John told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>He did not hide the truth, but he told people plainly. He said, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>So they asked him, Well then, are you Elijah? He answered, No, I am not. They asked,  Are you the Prophet? He answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>Then those priests said, Who are you? We want to give an answer to the people who sent us. What do you say about yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>John said, I am a voice calling in the desert, "Make the road straight for the Lord." This is what was said by Isaiah, the prophet of God long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>It was the Pharisees who had sent these people to John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>So they asked him, If you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet, why then are you baptizing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered, I baptize people in water. But there is a man standing among you whom you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>He is the one coming after me who is greater than I am. I am not even good enough to untie his shoe strings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>The place where John was baptizing was Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day John saw Jesus coming to him. Look, said John. See Gods special Lamb!  He takes away the wrong ways of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>Here is the man I told you about. I said that the one who is coming after me is greater than I am, because he lived before I lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>I myself did not know who he was. But I came and baptized people in water so that the people of Israel would know who he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>John also said, I saw the Spirit coming from the sky. He came down on him like a dove.  It stayed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>I myself did not know who he was. But he who sent me to baptize people in water told me. He said, "You will see the Spirit coming from the sky on a man. That man will baptize people in the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>I saw the Spirit coming on him, and I have told you. This man is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>The next day, John was standing with two of his followers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>Jesus walked by. When John saw him, he said, Look, see Gods Lamb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>The two followers heard what John said, so they went after Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>Jesus turned. He saw them coming after him. He said to them, What are you looking for? They said, Teacher, where do you live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>Jesus said, Come and see. They went and saw the place where Jesus was staying. The time was about four oclock in the afternoon. They stayed with Jesus the rest of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Andrew was one of those two followers of John who heard John speak and went after Jesus. He was Simon Peters brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>The first thing Andrew did then was to find his brother Simon. He said, We have found the Messiah! (Messiah means the Christ, the messenger of God.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, You are Simon, the son of John. Your name will be Cephas. (Cephas means Peter, a rock or stone.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The next day Jesus said, I will go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, Come with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Philip was from the town of Bethsaida. Andrew and Peter were also from that town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip went to find Nathanael. He said We have found the man about whom Moses wrote in the books of the law. The prophets also wrote about him. He is Jesus, from Nazareth. He is the son of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>Nathanael said, From Nazareth? Can any good thing come from there? Philip said,  Come and see for yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him. He said, Here is a man who is truly of Israel. He does not fool people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael asked, How do you know me? Jesus answered, I saw you when you were under the fig tree. That was before Philip called you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael said, Teacher, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered, I told you that I saw you under the fig tree. Is that why you believe in me now? You will see more wonderful things than that!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>I tell you the truth, said Jesus. You will see heaven open. You will see Gods angels going up and down to the Son of Man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>Two days later there was a wedding in the town of Cana in the country of Galilee. Jesus  mother was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>Jesus and his disciples were also asked to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>The people needed more wine. Then Jesus mother said to him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus said, Woman, why are you telling me about it? It is not yet the time for me to do something.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the servants, Do all that he tells you to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Six very large water pots made of stone were standing there. The pots were there because the Jews had a certain law about washing themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said, Fill the pots with water. So they filled them to the very top.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>Jesus said, Now take some out. Carry it to the one in charge of the feast. They did what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>The man in charge of the feast tasted the water that was now turned into wine. He did not know where it came from, but the servants who drew the water knew. When the man had tasted it, he called the man who was being married.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>He said, Other people give the good wine at the beginning of the feast. When people have had all they want, then they give the wine which is not so good. But you have kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This was the first big work that Jesus did. It was in Cana in Galilee. He showed that he was great. And his disciples believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went to the town called Capernaum. His mother, his brothers, and his disciples also went with him. They stayed there for a few days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near. So Jesus went to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>In the temple he found people buying and selling things. They were selling cows, sheep,  and doves. Others were sitting at tables changing money for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>Jesus tied some pieces of cord together to make a whip. Then he drove out all the people who were buying and selling in the temple. And he drove out the sheep and the cows. He threw down the tables of the money changers and their money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>He said to the people who sold doves, Take these things out of here. Do not make my Fathers house into a market place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>His disciples remembered that Gods word says, My love for your house is like a fire burning in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>The leaders of the Jews said to Jesus, Who gave you the right to do this? What big work will prove it to us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered them, Break down this temple and in three days I will raise it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jewish leaders said, It took forty-six years to build this temple. Do you say you will raise it in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But Jesus was talking about the temple which was his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>After Jesus died and had been raised from death, the disciples remembered that he had said this to them. Then they believed what the holy writings say. They also believed what Jesus had said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Many people believed in Jesus name when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast.  They believed in him because they saw the big works he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus would not trust himself to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>He knew what all people are like. He did not need anyone to tell him about any person,  because he knew what was in a persons heart.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>There was a man named Nicodemus. He was a Pharisee, a ruler and leader of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>One night Nicodemus came to Jesus. He said, Master, we know you are a teacher sent by God. We know this because no person could do the big works you are doing if God did not help him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. No person can see Gods kingdom if he is not born again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus said, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he go inside of his mother again and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. This new birth is by water and by the Spirit. No person can enter Gods kingdom if he has not been born that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of a person is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>You must not be surprised when I say, "You must be born again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind blows where it wants to blow. You can hear the sound of it. But you do not know where it comes from, and you do not know where it goes. It is the same way with everyone who is born of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus asked Jesus, How can such things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered, Are you a teacher of the people of Israel and you do not know this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>I tell you the truth. We know what we are talking about. We talk about the things we have seen. But you will not believe what we tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>You do not believe what I have told you about things on earth. So how will you believe if I tell you about things in heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>No one has ever gone up to heaven-only the One who came down from heaven. That One is the Son of Man who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>Moses lifted up a snake on a piece of wood in the desert. So the Son of Man must be lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>Then everyone who believes in him will not die, but will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>God loved the world so very, very much that he gave his only Son. Because he did that,  everyone who believes in him will not lose his life, but will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world. He sent him to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>Everyone who believes in the Son will not be judged. But everyone who does not believe in him is judged already, because he does not believe in the name of Gods only Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>Light came into the world. But people wanted to be in the dark because they did wrong things. They did not want the light. That is why they are judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>Everyone who does wrong things hates light. He does not come to the light because he is afraid people will see what he does and will say it is bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But everyone who does what is right comes to the light. He wants people to see that God helps him to do what is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After this, Jesus and his disciples came into the country of Judea. Jesus stayed there with them and baptized people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>John was also baptizing people in the river at Aenon, near the town of Salim. There was much water. People came to him and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>This was before John was put in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Johns disciples and the leaders of the Jews were talking about how to be clean, the way God wants us to be clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>They came to John and said, Teacher, there was a man with you on the other side of the Jordan River. You were telling people about him. Now he himself is baptizing and all the people are going to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered, A man cannot get anything unless God in heaven gives it to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves heard what I said. I am not the Christ but I have been sent ahead of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>The wife belongs to the man who has married her. The mans best friend may stand and listen. And when he hears what that man says, he is very glad for him. So what I hear makes me very glad in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must become more and more great, but I must become less and less great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>The one who comes from heaven is greater than all other people. The one who is of the earth talks about things on earth. So the one who comes from heaven is greater than all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>He tells what he has seen and heard, but no one wants to believe what he says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>If a person believes what the one from heaven says, then he also says God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>The one God sent speaks the words of God. God does not give him the Spirit little by little, but he gives the Spirit in full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves his Son and has put everything in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He who believes in the Son will live for ever. He who does not believe in the Son will not live. God will be very angry with him for ever.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>The Pharisees heard that Jesus was getting people to follow him and was baptizing them.  (Jesus disciples baptized them, not he himself.) He now had more followers than John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>The Lord knew that they had heard about it. So he left Judea and went back to Galilee again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>He had to pass through the country of Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>He came to a town in Samaria called Sychar. It was near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>Jacobs well was there. Jesus was very tired from walking on the road. So he sat down by the well. It was about midday.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>A woman from Samaria came to the well to draw water. Jesus said, Please give me a drink of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>His disciples had gone into the town to buy some food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>The woman said to Jesus, Why do you ask me for a drink of water? You are a Jew and I am from Samaria. (The Jews are not friends with the people of Samaria.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>Jesus answered her, You do not know what God gives people. And you do not know who is asking you for a drink. If you knew him, then it is you who would have asked for a drink of water. He would give you living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>The woman said, Sir, you have nothing to draw with. The well is deep. Where do you get that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us this well? He drank water from this well, also his children and cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Jesus answered her, Anyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>But anyone who drinks the water that I will give him will never be thirsty. The water I give him will become a well inside of him that will never be dry. It will give him life for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>The woman said, Sir, give me this water. Then I will never be thirsty again. I will not need to come here to draw water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>Jesus said, Go, call your husband, then come here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>She said, I have no husband. Jesus said, You say, "I have no husband." That is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>You have had five husbands, but the man you are living with now is not your husband.  You have told the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>The woman said, Sir, this shows me you are a prophet of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>Our fathers came to this mountain to worship God. But you people say Jerusalem is the place people must go to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Jesus said, Woman, believe what I say. The time is coming when you will not come to this mountain or to Jerusalem to worship my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>You worship one whom you do not know. But we know whom we worship. The Saviour will come of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>But the time is coming, yes, the time is here already, when those who worship God will worship him in spirit and in a true way. My Father is looking for that kind of people to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>God is Spirit. Those who worship him must do so in spirit and in a true way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>The woman said to Jesus, I know that Messiah is coming. His name is Christ. When he comes he will tell us everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>Jesus said to her, I who am talking to you am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>When Jesus had said this, his disciples came back. They were surprised to hear him talking to a woman. But not one of them asked, What do you want? or, Why are you talking to her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>The woman left her water-pot and went back to the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>She said to the people, Come, I will show you a man who has told me everything I have done. Can this be the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>The people left the town and went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>While they were on the way coming to Jesus, the disciples asked him, Teacher, will you please eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>Jesus said to them, I have food that you do not know about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>So the disciples asked one another, Has anyone brought him food to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>Jesus said to them, My food is to obey the one who sent me and to finish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Do you not say, "In four months it will be harvest time"? Listen, I say. Look up and see the fields. The harvest is ready to cut now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>The one who gathers the harvest receives a reward for it. He gathers a harvest that will live for ever. Then the one who sows and the one who gathers will both be happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>This saying is true here: "One sows and another gathers."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>I sent you to gather what you did not help to plant. Other people have worked hard and you have been helped through their work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>Many of the people of the town believed in Jesus because of what the woman told them.  She said, He told me everything I have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>When the people from Samaria came, they begged him to stay with them. So he stayed with them for two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>Many more people believed in Jesus because of his own word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>They said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of what you told us, but because of what he himself has told us. We know it is true. This is the Saviour of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>Two days after this, Jesus left Samaria and went to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>Jesus himself said, No prophet is honoured by the people in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>When he came to Galilee, the people of that country were glad to see him. They had seen all the things he did when he was at the feast in Jerusalem. They had been at the feast also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>So Jesus came back to the town of Cana in Galilee. That was the place where he had changed water into wine. One of the kings officers was there. His son was sick in the town of Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>He heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, and he went to Jesus and said, I beg you, come and heal my son. He is dying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>Jesus said to him, If you do not see some signs and big works, then you will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>The officer said, Sir, I beg you. Come right away before my son dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>Jesus said, Go home. Your son will not die. The man believed what Jesus said and went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>On the way, his servants met him. They said, Your son is living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>He asked, What time did he begin to get well? They said, Yesterday at one hour after midday the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>The father knew that was the time when Jesus said to him Your son will not die. So he and all his family believed in Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>In Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, there is a wide water hole. The Jews called this water hole Bethesda. It had five places with roofs for people to stand under.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>Many sick people were lying on these places. Some of them were blind. Some were lame. Some were very thin and stiff so that they could not move by themselves. All of them were waiting for the water to move.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>An angel came down into the water at a certain time and made it move. The first person who stepped into the water when it moved was healed of any sickness that he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>A man was there who had been sick for thirty eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>Jesus saw the man lying there. He knew that he had been sick for a long time. He said to him, Do you want to be healed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The sick man said to him, Sir, I have no man to put me into the water when it moves.  While I am trying to get in, some other person comes and gets in before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus said, Get up. Take up your bed and walk!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>The man was healed right away. He took up his bed and walked. This happened on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>So the leaders of the Jews talked to the man who was healed. They said, It is the Sabbath day. It is not right for you to carry your bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>But he answered them, The man who healed me said to me, "Take up your bed and walk."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>They asked him, Who is the man who told you to take up your bed and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>The man who was healed said, I do not know who he is. Many people were at the place and Jesus had gone away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>After that, Jesus saw the man in the temple. He said to him, See, you are healed. Do no more wrong things. If you do, something worse may happen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went away and told the leaders of the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>The Jewish leaders made trouble for Jesus because he did this on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, My Father is still working and I am working also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>This was why the leaders of the Jews tried much more to kill Jesus. He had broken the law of the Sabbath day. And also he called God his Father. In that way, he was making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Jesus said to them, l tell you the truth. The Son cannot do anything alone. He sees what his Father is doing and he does the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>My Father loves his Son. He shows him all that he himself is doing. He will show his Son bigger works than these so that you may be surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>My Father raises people who were dead, and gives them life. So his Son gives life to anyone he wants to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>My Father judges no one, but he has made his Son to be the judge of everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>He did this so that all people would respect the Son, just as they respect his Father. My Father has sent his Son. Anyone who does not respect his Son does not respect the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>I tell you the truth. The person who hears what I say and believes in him that sent me will live for ever. He will not be judged. He has already passed from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>I tell you the truth. The time is coming. Yes, the time is here when the dead people will hear the voice of the Son of God. Those who hear his voice will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>My Father has life in himself. And so he has made his Son to have life in himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>He has given his Son power also to judge because he is the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Do not be surprised at what I say. The time is coming when all who are in the graves will hear his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>They will come out of the graves. Those who have done what is good will come out to live. But those who have done what is wrong will come out to be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I have no right to do anything myself. I judge the way I am told to judge. The way I judge people is right. I do not do what I myself want to do, but I do what my Father wants me to do. He sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I talk about myself, then what I say is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>But someone else also speaks about me. I know what he says about me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You sent someone to John and he has told you the truth about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>I do not need to listen to what a person says about me. But I tell you this so that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>John was a light burning and shining. For a while you were happy to be in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have something greater than John to talk for me. It is the works that I do. My Father has given me works to finish. The works that I do tell that he sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And my Father who sent me has himself talked about me. You have never heard him speak and you do not know what he is like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>The word he talks is not in your hearts, because you do not believe the one he sent to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>You read holy writings carefully. You think that there you will find out how to live for ever. In the same writings you will read about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>And yet you will not come to me for that life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I do not want people to call me great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>But I know that you do not love God in your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come in my Fathers name, but you will not receive me. If another person comes in his own name, then you will receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can you believe? You are always calling each other great, but you do not want the only God to make you great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not think that I will carry a complaint against you to my Father. Moses has already carried the complaint against you. He is the very one you trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>If you really believed Moses, you would believe me too, because he wrote about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>Then Jesus crossed over the sea of Galilee. (Another name for this sea was Tiberias.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>Many people followed him because they saw the big works he had done in healing the sick people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>Jesus went up on a hill and sat down with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>When Jesus looked up, he saw many people coming to him. He said to Philip, Where shall we buy food for these people to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>Jesus knew what he himself would do, but he said this to see what Philip would do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered him, It would take nearly a years wages to buy enough food for them,  even if each one gets only a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of Jesus disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, talked to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>He said, A boy here has five loaves of bread and two small fish. But what can that little bit of food do for so many people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Jesus said, Tell the people to sit down. Much grass was there. The number of men who sat down was about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>Then Jesus took the bread and thanked God for it. He gave it to the disciples and they divided it among those who were sitting. He did the same thing with the fish. The people had all they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>When they had eaten enough, he said to his disciples, Gather up all the pieces that are left so that nothing will be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>They gathered all the pieces of the five loaves. Twelve baskets full were left over after all the people had eaten enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>When those men saw the big work that Jesus did, they said, Truly, this is the Prophet that is to come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>The people wanted to take Jesus by force to make him a king. When he saw this, he left again and went on the hill by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>In the evening his disciples went down to the lake &lt;FI&gt;called the sea of Galilee&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>They got in a boat and crossed over the sea toward the town of Capernaum. It was dark,  but Jesus had not come back to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>A strong wind was blowing. It made the water very rough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>They rowed the boat into the middle of the lake. Then they saw Jesus walking on the water. He came close to the boat. They were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But Jesus said to them, It is I. Do not fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they were glad to take him into the boat. Then at once the boat reached the land to which they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>The people who stayed back on the land had seen one boat only. They had seen the disciples get in it and go away without Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>But there were some other boats from Tiberias. It was near the place where they had eaten bread, after the Lord had thanked God for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>The next day the people saw that Jesus and his disciples were not there. Then they went to Capernaum in boats to look for Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>When they found Jesus on the other side of the lake, they said, Teacher, when did you get here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. You do not want me because you saw the big works I did,  but you want me because you ate all the bread you wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Do not work for the food that spoils, but work for the food that will never spoil, the food that will give you life for ever. The Son of Man will give you that food. God my Father has chosen him to do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>They asked him, What works does God ask us to do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered them, The work that God asks you to do is to believe in the one whom he has sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>They said, What big work will you do? We want to see it and believe you. What work are you are going to do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers ate bread in the wilderness. The holy writings say, "He gave them bread from heaven to eat." Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth. It was not Moses who gave you that bread from heaven. But my Father gives you true bread from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>He who comes down from heaven is the bread that God gives. He is the one who gives life to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>They said to him, Lord, give us this bread always!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>Jesus said, I am the bread that gives life. Anyone who comes to me will never be hungry.  Anyone who believes in me will never be thirsty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But I said to you that you have seen me, and yet you will not believe in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All those whom my Father gives me, they will come to me. I will never turn anyone away who comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>I did not come down from heaven to do what I myself want to do. I came to do what the one who sent me wants me to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>My Father sent me. He wants me to lose nothing that he has given me. And he wants me to raise it up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>My Father wants everyone who sees his Son and believes in him to live for ever. I will raise him up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>The leaders of the Jews did not like Jesus to say, I am the bread that has come down from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>They said, Is he not Josephs son, Jesus? We know his father and mother. How can he say, "I have come down from heaven"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus answered them, There is no need for you to talk against me to each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No one can come to me if my Father does not draw him. He sent me. I myself will raise up the one who comes to me. I will bring him back to life on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>The prophets wrote, "God will teach all people." So then, every person who listens to his words and learns what he says, he will come to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>But no person has seen my Father. The only one who has seen him is the one who comes from God. He has seen my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>I tell you the truth. The person who believes in me will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread that gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your fathers ate bread in the desert long ago, but they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>Here is bread that comes down from heaven. The person who eats this bread will never die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the bread that gives life. I came down from heaven. If anyone eats this bread, he will live for ever. I will give bread so that the world may live. I am that bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>The leaders of the Jews began to quarrel with each other about what Jesus said. They said, How can he give us himself to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. If you do not eat the Son of Man and do not drink his blood, you will not have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>Anyone who eats me and drinks my blood will live for ever. I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>I am real food, and my blood is real drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>Anyone who eats me and drinks my blood is in me and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>My Father is living. He sent me. I have my life from him. In the same way, the person who eats of me will live because of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This bread which came down from heaven is not like the bread that your fathers ate.  They ate bread but they died. Anyone who eats this bread from heaven will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>Jesus was in the meeting house in Capernaum when he was teaching people these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Many of his disciples heard it. They said, This is a hard teaching. Who can listen to it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>But Jesus knew that his disciples did not like what he said. He asked, Is this hard for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>What would you do if you saw the Son of Man go up to the place where he came from?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the Spirit that gives life. The flesh does not help. The words I say to you are Spirit and life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But even so, some of you do not believe me. Jesus knew right from the beginning which ones of them would not believe. He knew who was going to give him over to people who hated him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>Then Jesus said, That is why I said to you, "No one can come to me unless my Father lets him come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>After that, many of the followers of Jesus left him and stopped travelling around with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Jesus said to the twelve disciples, Will you also leave me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Simon Peter answered, Lord, to whom shall we go? It is you who has told us how we may live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>We believe now, and we know it is true. You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus said to them, Did I not choose you twelve? And one of you is a devil!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>Jesus was talking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. Judas was the one who was going to give him over to people who hated him. Judas was one of these twelve disciples.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After this, Jesus travelled around in Galilee. He would not travel around in Judea because the leaders of the Jews wanted to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Every year the Jews had a feast to remember the time when their fathers lived in tents in the desert. The time was near for that feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>Jesus brothers said to him, Go away from here to Judea. Let your disciples also see the work you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>When a person wants people to know about him, he does not hide what he is doing. If you are doing these big things, let the world see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>Even his brothers did not believe in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Jesus said to them, It is not yet the time for me to go. But you may go any time you want to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The people of the world cannot hate you. But they hate me because I say what they do is wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.8'>Go to the feast yourselves. I am not going to the feast until it is the right time for me to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>He said this to them and stayed in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>After his brothers went to the feast, Jesus went also. He did not go with the other people,  but he went by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>The leaders of the Jews at the feast tried to find him. They said, Where is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>People were talking among themselves about Jesus. Some said, He is a good man.  Others said, No. He is leading people to do wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>But they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, so no one talked about him out in the open.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>When the feast was half finished, Jesus went to the temple and taught the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>The Jews were very much surprised. How can this man know books? He never went to school.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>Jesus answered the people, I am not teaching you my teaching. It is the teaching of the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If any man wants to do what God wants him to do, he will know the teaching. He will know if it is Gods teaching or if I am speaking from my own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>The person who speaks from his own mind only wants to be great himself. But the person whom God has sent wants to show that God is great. That person is true. He is not a bad man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Did not Moses give you the law? Not one of you is keeping the law. Why are you trying to kill me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>The people answered Jesus, A bad spirit is in you! Who is trying to kill you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>Jesus answered them, I have done one thing. You are all surprised about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Moses gave you the law of circumcision. You obey the law, not because it came from Moses, but because it came from the fathers long ago. You circumcise a baby boy on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'>You do it on the Sabbath day so that you will not break the law of Moses. If you do that,  then why are you angry with me because I healed a man on the Sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'>Do not judge by what you see, but judge in the right way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Some people from Jerusalem said, Is not this the person they are trying to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>See, he does not fear to speak and yet they say nothing to him! Do the rulers really know that this man is the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.27'>But we know where this man comes from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>Jesus was teaching in the temple. He spoke loudly saying, You know me and you know where I come from. I have not come in my own power. The one who sent me is true. He is the one you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>I know him because I came from him. He sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>Then the people wanted to catch him. But no one put a hand on him. It was not yet the time for that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>Many of the people believed in Jesus. They said, When Christ comes, will he do greater works than this man has done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>The Pharisees heard what the people said about him. The chief priests and the Pharisees sent soldiers to catch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Jesus said, I will stay with you a short time longer. Then I will go back to him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>You will look for me, but you will not find me. You will not be able to go to the place where I will be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>The Jews said to one another, Where will he go that we cannot find him? Will he go to our people who are living in other countries? Will he teach them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What does he mean by this: "You will look for me and will not find me. You will not be able to go to the place where I will be"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>The last day of the feast was a big day. On that day Jesus stood up and shouted, If anyone is thirsty, he may come to me and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>If anyone believes in me, the holy writings say, "Rivers of water that give life will flow out of his heart."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>This is what Jesus meant: those who believe in him would receive the Spirit. At that time no one had received the Holy Spirit because Jesus had not yet been lifted up to heaven</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>When some of the people heard this they said, Truly, this is the Prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Other people said, This is the Christ. But some said, The Christ will not come from Galilee. Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'>Do not the holy writings say that Christ will be of Davids family? Will he not come from Bethlehem where David lived?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>The people did not all say the same thing about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>Some of them wanted to catch Jesus, but no one put hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>The soldiers came back to the chief priests and the Pharisees. They asked the soldiers,  Why did you not bring him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The soldiers replied, No person has ever talked like he does!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'>The Pharisees said, Has he fooled you also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'>None of the rulers and none of the Pharisees have believed on him, have they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'>These poor people do not know the law. They will die!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'>Nicodemus, the man who came to Jesus by night, was one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.51'>He said, Is it right to judge any man by our law before we hear him and learn what he has done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.52'>They answered him, Are you from Galilee also? Study what is written. You will see that no prophet is to come from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.53'>Then every one of them went home.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.8'>
        <verse osisID='John.8.1'>Then Jesus went to the hill called the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.2'>Early the next morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him. He sat down and taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman to Jesus. They had caught her having sex with a man who was not her husband. They made the woman stand in front of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>They said, Teacher, this woman has committed adultery. She was caught doing it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'>The law of Moses tells us that the people who do that should be killed with stones. What do you say?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>They said this to see what Jesus would do, because they wanted to find something wrong with him. Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>They kept on asking him. He stood up and said to them, The one among you who has never done any wrong thing may throw the first stone at her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.8'>And Jesus bent down again and wrote on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>When the people heard what he said, they went out, one by one. The oldest one went out first. Jesus was left alone with the woman in front of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>Jesus looked up and said to her, Woman, where are the people? Has no one judged you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>She said, No one, Sir. Jesus said, I also do not judge you. Go, and do no wrong thing again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'>Then Jesus talked to the people in the temple. He said, I am the Light of the world. The one who comes with me will never walk in the dark, but he will have light that gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.13'>The Pharisees said, You are talking about yourself. What you say is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.14'>Jesus said to them, Even if I do talk about myself, what I say is true. I know where I come from and I know where I am going. But you do not know where I came from, or where I am going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'>You judge in the way people judge matters. I do not judge any person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.16'>But even if I do judge, I judge right. I am not alone. My Father who sent me is with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.17'>Even in your law it says that when two people say the same thing, it is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.18'>I talk about myself, and my Father who sent me talks about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>They asked him, Where is your Father? He said, You do not know me and you do not know my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'>When Jesus said these words he was teaching in the temple. He was in the place where the money is kept. No one caught him because it was not yet his time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>Jesus talked to them again. He said, I am going away. You will try to find me and will die doing wrong things. You cannot come where I am going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.22'>Then the Jews said, Will he kill himself? He says, "You cannot come where I am going."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.23'>Jesus said to them, You are from below. I am from above. You belong to this world. I do not belong to this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.24'>That is why I said, "You will die doing wrong things." If you do not believe that I am who I said I am, then you will die doing wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>They said to him, Who are you? Jesus answered, I am what I told you from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>I have many things to say to you and to judge you in many things. But he who sent me is true. I tell the world what he has told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>The people did not understand that Jesus was talking to them about his Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>So Jesus said, When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he.  You will know that I do nothing by my own power, but I talk the way my Father taught me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.29'>He who sent me is with me always. I always do what he wants me to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>Many people believed in Jesus while he was talking this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'>Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him, If you obey my word, you are truly my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.32'>And you will understand the truth and the truth will make you free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>They said to him, We are Abrahams children. We have always been free. Why do you say to us, "You will be free"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.34'>Jesus answered them, I tell you the truth. People who do wrong things are not free.  They become a slave of the wrong things they do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.35'>A slave does not belong to the family for ever. But a son belongs for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.36'>So if the Son makes you free, you will be truly free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'>I know that you come from Abraham. But you want to kill me because you do not like what I tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.38'>I tell you about the things that I have seen where my Father is, and you do what you have seen your father do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>They answered him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said, If you were Abrahams children, you would do what Abraham did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'>But you want to kill me because I told you the truth which I learned from God. Abraham did not do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>You are doing your fathers work. Then they said to him, We were not born of an unmarried woman. God is the Father of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>Jesus said to them, If God were your Father you would love me, because I have come from God. I did not come by my own power. God sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>Why do you not understand what I say? I will tell you why. It is because you do not want to understand it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>The bad spirit, the devil, is your real father. You gladly do the wrong things he wants you to do. From the beginning he killed people. He has nothing to do with what is true.  His way is to tell lies. He himself is a liar and all lying comes from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>You do not believe me because I tell you what is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'>Which one of you can prove that what I have done is bad? I tell you what is true. Why then do you not believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'>The person who comes from God listens to what God says. You do not come from God.  That is why you do not listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'>The leaders of the Jews answered him, We say what is true. We say that you come from Samaria. And we say that a bad spirit is in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>Jesus said, I have no bad spirit in me. I respect my Father but you do not respect me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'>I do not want to make myself great. There is one who makes me great. He judges the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>I tell you the truth. If anyone obeys my word, he will never die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.52'>The leaders of the Jews said to him, Now we know it is true that a bad spirit is in you.  Abraham died. So did the prophets. And yet you say, "If anyone obeys my word, he will never die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>Are you greater than our father Abraham and the prophets of God who died long ago?  Who do you make yourself out to be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Jesus answered, If I make myself great, then I am not great. But my Father makes me great. You say he is your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>But you do not know God. I know him. If I say, "I do not know him," I am a liar, just as you people are. But I know him and I obey his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Your father Abraham was glad that he would see my coming. He did see it and he was very glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'>The Jewish leaders said to him, You are not fifty years old yet. How could Abraham see you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.58'>Jesus answered, I tell you the truth. I already was before Abraham was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.59'>Then they picked up stones to throw at him. But Jesus got out of their way. He left the temple and they did not know where he went.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.9'>
        <verse osisID='John.9.1'>On his way out of the temple Jesus saw a man who had been born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.2'>His disciples asked Jesus, Master, was this man born blind because of the wrong things he did, or was it the wrong things his parents did?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.3'>Jesus answered, It was not that he or his parents did any wrong thing. But it was so that people would see what God will do in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.4'>There is one who has sent me. I must do his work while it is still daylight. Night is coming. Then it will be too dark to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.5'>As long as I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.6'>When Jesus had said this, he spat on the ground. Then he put some of the wet dirt on the mans eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.7'>And he said, Go. wash your eyes in that water hole called Siloam. (Siloam means Sent.)  The man went and washed his eyes. After that, he was able to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.8'>His neighbours and other people had seen him when he was blind. They said, Is not this the same man who used to sit here and beg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.9'>Some people said, Yes, this is the same man. Others said, He is like that man. But the man himself said, I am that man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.10'>They asked him, How is it that you can see now?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.11'>He answered them, That man whose name is Jesus made some mud. He rubbed it on my eyes and told me to go and wash them in the water hole Siloam. And when I had washed my eyes, I could see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.12'>Where is the man? they asked. He said, I do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.13'>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.14'>The day Jesus made the mud and healed the man was the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.15'>Then the Pharisees also asked the man, How is it that you can see now? He answered them, The man put mud on my eyes. I washed my eyes and now I can see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.16'>Then some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God. He does not obey the Sabbath day law. The others said, But how can a bad man do such a big work? So the Pharisees did not agree together in what they thought about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.17'>Then they asked the man who had been born blind, What do you say about the man who healed you? He answered, I say he is a prophet from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.18'>But the leaders of the Jews did not really believe what they heard about the man. They did not believe that first he had been blind and now was able to see. So they called the parents of the man who could now see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.19'>Tell us, they said. Is this your son who you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.20'>The parents answered, We know that this is our son. And we know that he was born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.21'>But we do not know how it is that he can now see. We do not know who healed him.  Ask him. He is old enough to talk for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.22'>The parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. They knew that the leaders of the Jews had already agreed that if anyone said Jesus is the Christ, they would be put out of the meeting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.23'>That is why the parents said, He is old enough to talk for himself. Ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.24'>Then again they called the man who had been blind. They said to him, You must praise God for this. We know that the man who healed you is a bad man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.25'>He answered them, I do not know if he is a bad man or not. But one thing I do know. I know that first I was blind, but now I can see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.26'>Then they said to him again, What did he do to you? How did he heal you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.27'>He answered them, I told you already. You did not listen. Why do you want me to tell you again? Do you also want to be his disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.28'>This made them angry. They said, You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.29'>We know that God talked to Moses. But this man, we do not know where he comes from.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.30'>The man who had been blind said, This surprises me! He healed me and yet you do not know where he comes from!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.31'>We know that God does not listen to bad people. But God listens to the person who shows him respect and who obeys him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.32'>Before this, no one has ever healed a man who was born blind. Such a thing has not been heard of since the world was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.33'>If this man did not come from God, he could not do anything like this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.34'>They answered, You have been a bad man ever since you were born! Now are you trying to teach us? And with that they put him out of the meeting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.35'>Jesus heard that the people had put him out. When he found him, he said, Do you believe in the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.36'>He answered, Sir, who is the Son of God? Tell me, so that I may believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.37'>Jesus said, You have already seen him. The person who is talking to you now, he is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.38'>The man said, Sir, I do believe. He kneeled down in front of Jesus and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.39'>Jesus said, I came into the world so that people may be judged. I came so that those who are blind may see. And I came so that those who see may become blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.40'>Some of the Pharisees were with Jesus and heard him say this. They asked him, You mean to say that we are blind also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.41'>Jesus answered them, If you agreed that you were blind, you would not be bad people.  But you say, "We can see." So then you are still bad people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.10'>
        <verse osisID='John.10.1'>Then Jesus went on to say, I tell you the truth. A person must get to the sheep through the door. Anyone who climbs over the wall to get in is a bad man and steals things. He has come to steal the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.2'>But the man who comes in through the door, he is the one who takes care of the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.3'>The guard will open the door for him. The sheep will listen to him. He calls his own sheep by their names and leads them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.4'>When all his own sheep are out of the house, he goes ahead of them. The sheep come behind him because they know his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.5'>They will not go after a stranger. They will run away from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.6'>Jesus told this story to the Pharisees, but they did not understand what he was trying to tell them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.7'>So Jesus told them again. He said, I tell you the truth. I am the door of the sheep house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.8'>All those who came before me are bad people and steal things. They came to steal the sheep. But the sheep did not listen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.9'>I am the door. Anyone who comes in through me will be saved. He will go in and out as he wants to, and will have food to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.10'>The thief comes only to steal the sheep and to kill them and spoil them. I have come so that people may live and that they may enjoy life to the full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.11'>I am the good shepherd. I am the one who really cares for the sheep. The good shepherd is willing to die to save his sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.12'>Some people work for pay. The one who does that is not the one who really cares. The sheep do not belong to him. When he sees a bad animal coming, he will leave the sheep and run away. He will let the animal take the sheep and make the sheep run away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.13'>He does that because he is only working for pay and does not care what happens to the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.14'>I am the good shepherd, the one who really cares for the sheep. I know my sheep and my sheep know me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.15'>So my Father knows me and I know him. I am willing to die to save the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.16'>I have some other sheep which are not with these sheep. I must bring them also. They will listen to my voice. Then all the sheep will be together and there will be one person who cares for all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.17'>My Father loves me because I am willing to die. But when I die, I will live again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.18'>No one kills me. I die only because I choose to die. I have power to die and I have power to live again. This is what my Father has told me to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.19'>The Jews did not all say the same thing because of what Jesus said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.20'>Many of them said, A bad spirit is in him. He is crazy. Why do you listen to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.21'>But others said, A person who has a bad spirit in him does not say the things this man says. Can a bad spirit make blind people see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.22'>At that time there was a feast in Jerusalem at the temple. It was the cold time of the year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.23'>Jesus was walking in that part of the temple called Solomons resting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.24'>The Jews came around Jesus and said, How long will you keep us wondering about this matter? If you are really the Christ, then tell us plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.25'>Then Jesus said, I have already told you and you did not believe it. My Father has given me the power to do big works. These works tell you who I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.26'>And yet you do not believe because you are not my sheep. I told you this before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.27'>My sheep listen to me. I know them. They come to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.28'>I give them life that lasts for ever. They will never die. No one will take them out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.29'>My Father gave the sheep to me. He is greater than anyone else. No one is able to take them out of my Fathers hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.30'>My Father and I are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.31'>Then the leaders of the Jews picked up stones again to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.32'>So Jesus said to them, I have done many good things that come from my Father. For which one of those are you going to kill me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>Then the Jewish leaders answered him, We do not kill you for doing any good thing. But you do not respect God. You are only a man, and yet you say you are God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>Jesus answered them, In your own books it is written that God said, "You are gods."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>, fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.36'>Nothing can change the words in the holy writings. It is written that God spoke to men and that he called them gods. So he called some men gods. Then why do you say I do not respect God when I say that I am the Son of God? I am the one God chose and sent into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.37'>If I am not doing my Fathers work, then do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.38'>But if I am doing my Fathers work, believe the work that I do, even though you do not believe me. Then you will know and you will believe that my Father is in me and I am in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.39'>Because of what he said, they tried to catch Jesus again. But he got away from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>He went away again to the other side of the Jordan River. He went to the place where John &lt;FI&gt;the Baptizer&lt;Fi&gt; was when he first baptized people. Jesus stayed there for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>Many people came to him there. They said, John himself did not do any big work. But everything that John said about this man is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.42'>Many people believed on Jesus there.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>A man named Lazarus was sick. He lived at Bethany, the home of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>Mary was the same woman that put oil on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair. It was her brother Lazarus who was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>So the sisters sent someone to tell Jesus. They said, Lord, the one whom you love is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>Jesus heard the message. He said, The man is sick, but he will not die from it. But this will show people that God is great, and his Son also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>When he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two days more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>After that, he said to his disciples, Let us go back again to Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>They said, Master, it is not long since the Jews wanted to kill you with stones. Are you going back there again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered them, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a person walks in the daylight, then he will not fall. He can see by the light that is in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if a person walks at night, he will fall because there is no light for him to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>After he said this, he said also, Our friend Lazarus is sleeping, but I am going to wake him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>His disciples said, Lord, if he is sleeping then he will get well again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>But Jesus meant that Lazarus had died. The disciples thought that Lazarus was sleeping to have a rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then Jesus told them plainly. He said, Lazarus is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>For your sake I am glad that I was not there. You will really believe in me. But come, let us go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to the other disciples, Let us all go and die with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>When Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had been buried four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Bethany was only about two miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>Many Jews had come out to see Martha and Mary. They came to comfort them because their brother had died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him. But Mary just stayed in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But even yet, I know that God will give you anything that you ask for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said, Your brother will rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha said, I know that he will rise when the dead people are raised up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said, I am the one who will raise people up and give them life. The person who believes in me will live, even though he has died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>Anyone who is living and who believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She said, Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ. I believe that you are the Son of God who was to come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>When she had said this, she went back to call her sister. She said quietly, Mary, the Master has come. He is calling you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>When Mary heard that, she got up quickly and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Jesus was not in the town yet. He was at the same place where Martha had met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews who were in the house to comfort Mary saw her get up quickly and go out.  They went after her. They said, She is going to the grave to cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Mary reached the place where Jesus was. When she saw him, she kneeled down before him and said, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>Jesus saw her crying. He saw the Jews who came with her crying also. Then his heart was troubled very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>Where have you buried him? he said. Come, Lord, and see, they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Then Jesus cried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>Look, the Jews said. He truly loved him very much!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>Then some of them said, This man made the blind see. Could he not have saved Lazarus from dying?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus heart was troubled very much again. Then he came to the grave. It was a hole in the side of a large rock. A stone covered the hole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, Take the stone away. Martha, the sister of the dead man, said, Lord, he will smell bad by this time. He has been dead four days already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you believed God you would see that he is great?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>So they pushed the stone away from the grave. Jesus looked up and said, Father, I thank you because you have heard me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>I know that you always hear me. But I have said this so that the people who are standing here might believe that you have sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>When he had said this, he shouted, Lazarus, come out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>Out came the dead man! The cloth that they had buried him in was tied around his hands and feet. Another small cloth was tied around his face. Jesus said to the people, Take off the cloths and free him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>When they saw the things Jesus did, many of the Jews who had come with Mary believed on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>So the chief priests and the Pharisees met together. They said, What are we going to do?  This man is doing many big works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we do not stop him, everybody will believe on him. Then the Roman rulers will come and break down our holy town and our nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>One of them, Caiaphas, was high priest that year. He said to them, You know nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>You do not understand. It is better for us if one person dies for the people. Then the whole nation will not be broken down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>He himself did not understand what he was saying. But he was the high priest that year.  God spoke through him to say that Jesus should die for those people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>Jesus would die, not only for those people, but he would gather together all of Gods people who are out in different places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>So from that day on they planned to kill Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>That is why Jesus did not go among the Jews in the open. But he went to another part of the country, to a town called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near. Many people from all around the country went to Jerusalem. They had to make themselves clean according to the law before the Passover Feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>They were looking around for Jesus. As they were standing in the temple they talked to one another. They said, What do you think? Do you think that he will come to the feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Both the chief priest and the Pharisees had told the people, If any man knows where he is, tell us. We want to catch him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Six days before the Passover Feast Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus lived. This was the Lazarus that Jesus had raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>The people made supper for Jesus. Martha helped give food for the people, and Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Mary had a jar of oil. It smelled very nice and cost much money. She put some of it on Jesus feet. Then she wiped his feet with her hair. The smell of oil went all through the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, was there. He was one of the disciples, the one who was going to give Jesus over to the people who hated him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>He said, This oil is worth a years wages! Why did we not sell it and give the money to poor people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>Judas did not say this because he cared for poor people. But he used to steal. He carried the disciples money bag and he used to take money out of the bag for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Then Jesus said, Leave her alone. She has kept this oil for the time when they will bury me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>You will have poor people with you always. But you will not always have me with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>Many of the Jews knew that Jesus was at Bethany. So they came because Jesus was there. But they also came to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>The chief priests planned to kill Lazarus also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>Many of the Jews left the priests and believed in Jesus, because of Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>The next day Jesus went to Jerusalem. Many people who were at the feast heard that he was coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>So they took branches of palm trees and went to meet him. They shouted, Praise God!  God bless the King of Israel! He is coming in the name of the Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>Then Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it. He did as the holy writings say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>Do not fear, people of Jerusalem. Your King is coming. He will be riding on a young donkey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>His disciples did not understand this at first. But when God had made Jesus great, then they remembered what the holy writings said about him. They remembered that people had done these things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>Many people were with Jesus when he called Lazarus out of the grave and raised him from death. They had talked about what he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>That is why many people went out to meet Jesus. They had heard about the big work he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees said to each other, See, you cannot stop this thing. People everywhere are going after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Some of the people who came to worship God at the feast were Greek people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>They came to Philip who was from Bethsaida in Galilee. They said, Sir, we want to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip came to Andrew and told him. Then they both went and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>Jesus said, The time has come when the Son of Man will be made great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>I tell you the truth. If a seed of grain is not put in the ground to die, it will be only a seed.  But if it dies, it will bear many seeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>Anyone who tries to keep his life will lose it. Anyone who gives up his life in this world will live for ever in the next world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If anyone wants to do my work, he must go where I go. Then he and I will be together.  My Father will honour everyone who works for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now my heart is very sad. Shall I say, "Father, save me from this time of trouble"? No, I have come to this time just so that I might go through it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, do what will make your name great. Then a voice from the sky said, I have already done that and I will do it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>Some people were standing near. When they heard the voice, they said, It is thundering.  Other people said, An angel talked to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered them, This voice did not come for my sake, but it came for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>It is time now for the world to be judged. The ruler of this world will be put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And as for me, if they lift me up from the earth, I will draw all people to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>He said this to show how he would die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The people answered him, Our law book tells us that Christ will stay here for ever. Why do you say, "The Son of Man will be raised up from the earth"? Tell us who this Son of Man is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Then Jesus said to them, You have light for a short time longer. Walk while you have the light so that you will not need to walk in the dark. The person who walks in the dark cannot see where he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may be a people who have the light in you. When Jesus had said this, he left them. They did not know where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>Even though they had seen Jesus doing many big works, they did not believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>What the prophet Isaiah said came true. He said, Lord, who has believed what we told them? Who has believed even though they have seen the power of Gods hand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>, fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>So they could not believe. Isaiah said also, God has made them blind. Their hearts have no feeling. They cannot see. They do not understand with their heart. They will not turn to God. If they did turn, he would heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>Isaiah said this about the Christ when he saw how great he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Some of the chief rulers believed in Jesus, but they did not tell anyone that they believed in him. They were afraid the Pharisees would put them out of the meeting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>They wanted the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>Jesus called out, Anyone who believes in me does not believe just in me, but in the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>Anyone who sees me sees the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I am a light and have come into the world. Anyone who believes in me will not be in the dark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>If anyone hears what I say and does not believe it, I do not judge him. I did not come to judge the world. I came to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>The one who will not believe in me and will not listen to what I say will be judged anyway. The same things that I have said will judge him on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>I have not said this from my own mind, but my Father who sent me told me what to say.  He told me what to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>I know that what he told me to say has power to give life for ever. So I say everything my Father has told me to say.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Before the Passover Feast had started, Jesus saw that the time had come for him to leave this world. The time had come for him to go back to his Father. He loved his own people who were in the world. And he loved them the same way right to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>He and his disciples were eating together. The devil had already put it into Judas heart to give Jesus over to people who hated him. (Judas was the son of Simon Iscariot.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>Jesus knew that his Father had put everything into his hands. He knew he had come from God. He knew he was going back to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>Jesus stood up where he had been eating. He took off his outer clothing. And he took a towel and tied it around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>Then he poured water into a pan and began to wash the disciples feet. He wiped their feet with the towel he had tied around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>He came to Simon Peter. Peter said to him, Lord, are you going to wash my feet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.7'>Jesus answered him, You do not understand now what I am doing, but you will understand it later.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.8'>Peter said to him, You will never wash my feet! Jesus answered him, If I do not wash you, then you do not belong to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.9'>Simon Peter said to him, Lord, wash my feet, and my hands, and my head also!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus said, A person who has bathed himself needs to wash his feet only. He is all clean.  You are clean, but not all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>Jesus knew who was going to give him over to people who hated him. That is why he said, You are not all clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>After Jesus had finished washing their feet, he took his gown and sat down again. Do you understand what I have done to you? he asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.13'>You call me Master and Lord. What you say is right. I am your Master and Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.14'>I am your Lord and Master and have washed your feet. If I do that, then you should wash one anothers feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.15'>I have shown you what to do. Now you do as I have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.16'>I tell you the truth. The servant is not better than his master. The one who is sent is not better than the one who sent him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.18'>I am not talking about all of you but I know the people I have chosen. So Gods word comes true. The holy writings say, "He who is eating my bread has turned against me."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.20'>I tell you the truth. The person who receives the one I send, receives me. He that receives me, receives the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.21'>When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in his heart. He said, I tell you the truth. One of you will give me over to people who hate me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.22'>The disciples looked at one another. They did not know which one of them Jesus was talking about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.23'>The disciple Jesus loved was at his right side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.24'>Simon Peter nodded to that disciple. He said, Tell us who he is talking about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.25'>He who was at Jesus right side said to Jesus, Lord, who is it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.26'>Jesus answered, I will put a piece of bread in the dish. Then I will give it to that one. He put in the bread, then he took it and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.27'>Right after Jesus had given the bread, Satan came into Judas. Then Jesus said to him,  What you are going to do, do right away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.28'>No one at the table knew why Jesus said, Do it right away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.29'>Judas had the money bag. Some thought that Jesus was telling him, Buy what we need for the feast, or that he wanted Judas to give something to the poor people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.30'>Judas went out right after he had taken the bread. It was night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.31'>When he had gone out, Jesus said, Now the Son of Man is very great. And he has made Gods name great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.32'>If he has made Gods name great, God also will make him great by his own power. He will do it right away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.14.20'>At that time you will know that I am in my Father. You are in me, and I am in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.21'>He who knows the things I tell him to do and does them, really loves me. My Father will love him and I also will love him. I will show him who I am.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.14.23'>Jesus said to him, If a person loves me, he will obey me. My Father also will love him.  And we will come to him and will live with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.24'>The person who does not love me does not obey me. The word which you hear is not my word. It is my Fathers word. He is the one who sent me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.14.26'>But the Holy Spirit is the one who will help you. My Father will send him in my name.  He will teach you everything that I have said to you. His Helper will remind you of all that I said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.27'>Peace is what I leave for you. I give you my own peace. People of the world also say,  "Peace" to you. I do not say it as they say it. Do not let anything trouble your hearts. Do not fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.28'>You heard me say, "I am going away and then I will come back to you." If you really loved me, then you would have been very glad that I am going to my Father. My Father is greater than I am.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.15.1'>I am the real fruit tree. My Father is the One who takes care of the tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.2'>He takes away from me every branch that does not bear fruit. And he cleans every branch that bears fruit so that it will bear more fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.3'>What I said to you has made you clean already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.4'>But you must be in me and I will be in you. The branch cannot bear fruit by itself. It must be joined to the tree. And you cannot do any good thing if you are not joined to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.5'>I am the fruit tree and you are the branches. I will be in the person who is in me. That person will have a fruitful life. But you can do nothing without me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.6'>If any person is not in me, he is cut off like a branch and dies. People gather the dry branches and throw them into the fire to be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.7'>If you are in me and obey me, you may ask me for anything you want and I will give it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.8'>If you do much good and become my disciples, you will make my Fathers name great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.9'>I have loved you just as my Father has loved you. So let me love you always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.10'>If you obey me, I will love you always. That is what I have done. I have obeyed my Father. And he will love me always.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.15.12'>I am telling you to love each other as I have loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.13'>The strongest love anyone can have is this. He will die to save his friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.14'>You are my friends if you do what I tell you to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.15'>I do not call you servants anymore, for the servant does not know what his master is doing. But I have called you friends because you know everything that my Father has told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.16'>You did not choose me, but I chose you. I gave you a big work to do. That work is to go out and do good things and to make the good things that you do remain strong. If you do that, my Father will do anything you ask in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.17'>Here is the law I gave you. Love each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.18'>If the world hates you, remember that it hated me before it hated you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.19'>If you belonged to this world, the world would love you. But you do not belong to the world. I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.20'>Remember what I told you. I said, "The servant is not better than his master." If the people in the world have troubled me, they will also trouble you. If they obey me, they will also obey you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.21'>They will do all these things to you because you are true to me. They do not know the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.22'>I came and spoke to them. If I had not done that, then what they did would not have been a wrong thing. But now they have no excuse for doing it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.23'>The person who hates me hates my Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.24'>No other person has ever done the work that I have done. If they had, then what they did would not be a wrong thing. But now they have seen me and hated me and my Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.25'>This has happened in order to make the words of their law book come true. It says,  "They hated me for no reason."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.16.1'>I have told you these things so that you will not turn back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.2'>The people will put you out of the meeting place. Yes, the time is coming when someone will kill you and think he is working for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.3'>They will do these things because they do not know my Father nor me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.4'>I have told you all these things now. Then when that time comes, you will remember that I told you about them. I did not tell you these things in the beginning because I myself was with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.5'>But now I am going back to him who sent me here. Yet not one of you is asking me,  "Where are you going?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.6'>Your hearts are very sad because I have told you these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.7'>Anyway, I am telling you the truth. It is better for you if I go away. If I do not go away,  the one who is to help you will not come to you. But if I go away, I will send him to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.8'>When the Helper comes, he will prove this to the people of the world that they are wrong. They are wrong about what they call bad and about what they call good. He will show them how to be right with God. He will show them about Gods judgement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.9'>He will prove it is a bad thing that they do not believe in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.10'>He will show what really is right, because I am going to my Father and you will not see me any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.11'>He will show them how to judge right, because the ruler of this world himself will be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.12'>I have many other things to tell you, but you cannot understand them now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.13'>When the truth-giving Spirit comes, he will show you everything that is true. He will not speak his own message, but he will tell you the things that he has been told to tell you. He will tell you what is going to happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.14'>He will make my name great. He will take what is mine and tell it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.15'>Everything that belongs to my Father belongs to me also. That is why I said, "He will take what is mine and tell it to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.16'>Very soon now, you will not see me. A little while after that, you will see me again,  because I go to my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.17'>Some of the disciples talked among themselves and said, He says, "Very soon now, you will not see me. A little while after that, you will see me." And he says, "Because I go to my Father." What does he mean by "a little while"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.18'>We do not know what he means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.19'>Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him this question. So he said to them, Are you asking each other what I mean by saying, "Very soon you will not see me. Then in a little while after that you will see me"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.20'>I tell you the truth. You people will cry and be very sad, but the people in the world will be very glad. At first you will be sad, but after that you will not be sad. You will be glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.21'>Any woman is sad just before her baby is born. She has much pain because the time has come for the baby to be born. But as soon as the baby is born, she forgets the pain she had. She is very glad because a person has been born into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.22'>So you also are very sad now. But I will see you again. Then you will be very glad. And no one can take your joy from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.23'>When that time comes, you will not ask me for anything. I tell you the truth. My Father will do for you anything you ask in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.24'>You have not asked for anything in my name yet. Ask my Father and he will give it to you. That is what will make you very glad always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.25'>I have told you these things by a story. The time will come when I will not talk by stories. I will tell you about my Father plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.26'>When that day comes, you will ask in my name. I do not say that I will ask my Father for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.27'>My Father himself loves you. He loves you because you have loved me. And he loves you because you have believed that God sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.28'>My Father sent me into the world. And now I will leave the world and go back to my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.29'>The disciples said to him, Yes, now you are telling us plainly. You are not telling us with words we do not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.30'>We know now that you know everything. No one needs to ask you questions. This makes us believe that God sent you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.31'>Jesus answered them, Do you really believe now?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.32'>Listen, the time is coming. No, the time is here when you will run away. Every man will go to his own home. You will leave me on my own. And yet I am not alone, because my Father is with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.33'>I have told you these things so that you may have peace. I give you peace. The world will trouble you much. But be glad. I have power over the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.17.11'>I am not in the world any longer. But they are in the world. And I am coming to you.  Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me. Then they will be one,  just as you and I are one.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.18'>
        <verse osisID='John.18.1'>When Jesus had finished saying this, he and his disciples went through the valley called Kidron. There was a garden with trees. He and his disciples went into the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.2'>Jesus had gone to this place often with his disciples, so Judas knew where the place was.  He was the one who gave Jesus over to the people who hated him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.3'>The chief priests and the Pharisees sent soldiers and guards with Judas. They had lamps,  and torches, and things to fight with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.4'>Jesus knew everything that was going to happen to him. So he went out and said to them,  Who are you looking for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.5'>They answered, Jesus from Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I am he. Judas, who had given Jesus over to them, was standing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.6'>When Jesus said to them, I am he, they all drew back suddenly and fell down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.7'>So Jesus asked them again, Who are you looking for? And they said, Jesus from Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.8'>Then Jesus answered, I have already told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, let these men go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.9'>So his words came true. He had said, I did not lose one of those you gave me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.10'>Simon Peter had a long knife or sword. He took it out and hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. The servants name was Malchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.11'>Jesus said to Peter, Put your sword back in its place. Must I not drink the cup that my Father has given me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.12'>Then the soldiers, and the captain, and the guards caught Jesus and tied him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.13'>First they took him to Annas. He was the father of Caiaphas wife. Caiaphas was the high priest that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.14'>This was the same Caiaphas that had talked to the leaders of the Jews. He had said, It is better for one man to die for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.15'>Simon Peter and one other disciple went after Jesus. The other disciple knew the high priest, so he went right in with Jesus through the gate of the high priests large house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.16'>But Peter stood by the gate outside. The other disciple who knew the high priest talked to the servant at the door and brought in Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.17'>The servant at the door said to Peter, Are you one of this mans disciples too? Peter said,  No, I am not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.18'>It was cold there. The servants and the officers had made a small fire. They stood by it and warmed themselves. Peter stood by the fire also and warmed himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.19'>The high priest then asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.20'>Jesus answered him, I have talked so that anyone who wanted to could hear me. I have always taught in the meeting houses and in the temple. That is where the Jews always go.  I have not said anything in a secret way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.21'>Why do you ask me? The people heard me talk. Ask them what I told them. They know what I said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.22'>When he had said this, one of the officers who stood there hit Jesus. He said, Is that the way you answer the high priest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.23'>Jesus answered him, If I have said anything bad, tell me plainly what wrong thing I have said. If I have told the truth, why do you hit me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.24'>Jesus was still tied up. Annas sent him over to Caiaphas the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.25'>Simon Peter stayed by the fire and stood warming himself. So the people said to him,  Are you not one of his disciples also? He said, No, I am not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.26'>A servant was there. He was of the same family as the one whose ear Peter had cut off.  He said, Did I not see you in the garden with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.27'>Again Peter said, No! And just then a cock called out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.28'>Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the court house. It was early in the day. They themselves did not go into the court house. They did not want to become unclean. They wanted to eat the Passover Feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>Pilate went out to the Jewish leaders and said, What complaint do you bring against this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They said to him, If he were not a very bad man, then we would not have brought him to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>Pilate said, Take him and judge him by your own law. The leaders of the Jews said,  But we are not allowed to kill anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>So this is the way the words of Jesus came true. He had said how he was going to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Then Pilate went back into the court house again. He called for Jesus and asked him,  Are you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus answered, Do you ask me because you yourself think I am, or do you ask me because others said I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own people and the chief priests have brought you here to me. Tell me, what have you done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered him, I am not a king in this world. If I were, my people would fight so that I would not be given to the Jews. But I am not a king in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>So Pilate said, So you really are a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. The reason that I was born was that I should tell what is true. That is why I came into the world. Everyone who likes what is true listens to what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate said, What is truth? When he had said this, he went out to the Jews again. He told them, I find nothing wrong in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But at the Passover Feast you always want me to let one prisoner go free for you. Do you want me to let the King of the Jews go free?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>Then they all shouted again, Not this man, but Barabbas! Barabbas was a man who had stolen things.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Pilate took Jesus and had him beaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>The soldiers made a big ring of thorns like a crown and put it on Jesus head. They put a red gown on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>They said, Greetings, King of the Jews! They beat him with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Then Pilate went out to the people again and said to them, See, I bring the man before you. This is to show you that I find nothing wrong in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Then Jesus came out. He had the crown of thorns on his head and had the red gown on him. Pilate said, Here is the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When the chief priests and the officers saw Jesus, they shouted, Nail him to a cross! Nail him to a cross! Pilate said to them, You take him and nail him to a cross. I find nothing wrong in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The leaders of the Jews answered him, We have a law. That law says he should die,  because he calls himself the Son of God. When Pilate heard what they said, he was very much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>He went into the court house again and said to Jesus, Where do you come from? But Jesus did not answer him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Then Pilate said, Do you not answer me? Do you not know that I have power to nail you to a cross, or to let you go free?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus said, You would have no power over me if God did not give you power. So then,  the man who gave me up to you has done something worse than you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>After that Pilate tried to let Jesus go free. But the Jews shouted, If you let this man free,  you are not Caesars friend! Anyone who makes himself a king is fighting against Caesar!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out. Then Pilate sat on the bench where the judge sits. The place was called the Street of Stone. The Jews called it Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>It was about the middle of the day before the Passover Feast. Pilate said to the Jews,  See, here is your King!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they shouted, Take him away! Take him away! Nail him to a cross! Pilate said to them, Shall I nail your King to a cross? The chief priests answered, Caesar is the only king we have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then Pilate gave them Jesus to be nailed to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>They took Jesus and led him away. Jesus went out carrying his own cross. They went to a place which the Jews called Golgotha. That means the place of the skull bone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>There they nailed Jesus to the cross. Two other people were also nailed to crosses. One was put on each side of Jesus. Jesus was put in the centre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>Pilate wrote a sign and put it on the cross. He wrote, Jesus from Nazareth, the King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>Many of the Jews read this sign. The place where Jesus was nailed to a cross was near the city. The sign was written in the Jewish, Greek, and Latin languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Then the chief priests among the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, "The King of the Jews," but write, "This man said he is King of the Jews."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>When the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his clothes. They divided them into four parts and gave each soldier one part. Then they took his coat. It was not sewn together but the cloth was all made in one piece from the top to the bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>So the soldiers said to one another, We will not tear this. But let us gamble for it. What the holy writings say came true. They say, They divided my clothes among them. They gambled for my coat. That is what the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mothers sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas,  and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing near. He said to his mother, Woman, see your son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>And he said to the disciple, See your mother! From that time on, that disciple took her to live in his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>Jesus now knew that everything had happened that the holy writings said. He said, I am thirsty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>A bowl of bad wine was there. They took something called a sponge and made it wet with the wine. Then they put it on a stick and put it to Jesus mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>Jesus took the wine. Then he said, It is finished. And he bowed his head and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>It was the day before the Sabbath day. The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day because it was a big day. So they begged Pilate to break the legs of those who had been nailed to crosses. Then they could be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>The soldiers came and broke the legs of the one nailed to the cross on one side of Jesus.  Then they broke the legs of the one on the other side of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>When they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead already. So they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>One of the soldiers stuck a spear into the side of Jesus body. Right away, blood and water came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>The man who saw it told what he saw, so that you may believe. What he said is true and he knows that it is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>What the holy writings say came true. They say, Not one of his bones shall be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>They also say, They shall look at the one into whom they stuck the spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>A man named Joseph, from the town of Arimathea, was a disciple of Jesus. But he did not say so because he was afraid of the leaders of the Jews. After all this had happened,  he went to Pilate. He asked him to let him take Jesus body away. Pilate let him. So he came and took his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>Nicodemus also came. He was the one who had come to Jesus at night. He brought with him a heavy bag of sweet-smelling spices called myrrh and aloes. It was mixed together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>They wrapped linen cloth around the body of Jesus and put the myrrh and aloes in with the cloth. That is how Jews bury a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>There was a garden at the place where Jesus was nailed to the cross. In the garden was a new grave cut in the rock. No one had ever been laid in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>They laid Jesus body there because it was the day before the Sabbath day, and the grave was near.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>Mary Magdalene came to the grave on the first day of the week. It was early in the morning and not very light. She saw that the stone had been taken away from the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>So she ran and met Simon Peter and the other disciple, whom Jesus loved. She said to them, They have taken the Lord out of the grave! We do not know where they have laid him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Then Peter and that other disciple also went to the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>Both of them ran. The other disciple ran faster than Peter and got to the grave first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>He bent down and looked in. He saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go inside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then Simon Peter came up behind him. He went into the grave and saw the linen cloths lying there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>He also saw the small cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus head. It was not with the other cloths, but it was folded together by itself in another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple, who got there first, also went in. He saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>Until this time they did not understand the holy writings where it says, He must rise from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood outside the grave crying. As she cried, she bent down and looked into the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>She saw two angels with white clothes on. They were sitting where Jesus body had been.  One sat at the head and one at the foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>They said to her, Woman, why are you crying? She said to them, They have taken away my Lord and I do not know where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>When she had said this, she turned around. She saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for? She thought he was the man who took care of the garden. So she said to him, Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him. I will take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said to her, Mary. She turned around again and said, Master!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus said to her, Do not hold me, because I have not yet gone up to my Father. But go to my brothers and tell them that I am going up to my Father. He is your Father also. I am going up to my God. He is your God also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene went to the disciples. She said, I have seen the Lord! And she told them what he had said to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>It was the first day of the week. In the evening the disciples were in a house together.  The doors were shut because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Jesus came and stood there with them. He said to them, Peace to you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Jesus said to them again, Peace to you! My Father sent me: now I am sending you in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>When he had said this, he breathed on them and said, Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>Whoever you make free from the wrong things they have done will be free. Whoever you do not make free from the wrong things they have done will not be free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>Thomas, one of the twelve disciples, was called the Twin. He was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples told him about it. They said, We have seen the Lord! Thomas said, I will not believe unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands. I will not believe unless I put my finger on the mark and feel his side with my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>Then eight days later his disciples were in the house again. This time Thomas was with them. The doors were shut. Then Jesus came and stood there with them. He said to them, Peace to you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then he said to Thomas, Put your finger here. Look at my hands. Feel my side with your hand. Do not doubt anymore, but believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas said to him, My Lord and my God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus said to him, You yourself have seen me. Is that why you now believe? God will bless people who believe though they have not seen me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>Jesus did many other big works when he was with the disciples. They are not written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>But these things are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. And when you believe in his name, then he will give you power to live.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>The next time the disciples saw Jesus was at the Sea of Tiberias &lt;FI&gt;Galilee&lt;Fi&gt; . This is how Jesus showed himself to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>Some of the disciples were in one place. They were Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said to the others, I am going fishing. The others said, We are going with you also. They went out in a boat right away. That night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>Early in the morning, Jesus was standing there by the sea. The disciples did not know it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>He said to them, My children, did you catch any fish? They answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>He said to them, Throw out your net on the right side of the boat, then you will catch some. They threw out their net and caught many fish, so that they were not able to bring in the net.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord! As soon as Simon Peter heard it was the Lord, he put on his coat and his belt. He had taken off some clothes to work. Then he jumped into the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>The other disciples came in a small boat. They were pulling the net. It was full of fish.  They were not far from the land, only about a hundred yards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>When they came to the land, they saw a small fire. Fish and some bread lay on the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went to the boat. He pulled the net to land. It was full of big fish. There were a hundred and fifty three fish. But even with so many fish the net did not break.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus said to them, Come and eat. The disciples were all afraid to ask him, Who are you? They knew it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus came. He took bread and gave it to them. Then he took fish and gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>After they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these? He said, Yes, Lord. You know that I like you. I am your friend. Jesus said to him, Feed my lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He asked him the second time, Simon, son of John, do you love me? Peter said, Yes,  Lord. You know that I like you. I am your friend. Jesus said to him, Take care of my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>Then he asked Peter the third time, Simon son of John, do you like me? Peter was sad because of the way Jesus asked him the third time. So he answered him, Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you as a close friend Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>I tell you the truth. When you were young, you put on your own belt. You went where you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will put out your hands. Others will put your belt on for you. They will take you where you do not want to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>Jesus said this to show how Peter would die and make Gods name great. When he had finished saying this, he said to him, Come and follow me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter turned around. The disciple whom Jesus loved was coming with Jesus also. He was the one who was at Jesus right side at the supper table. He had said to Jesus, Lord, who will give you over to people who hate you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, Lord, what about this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus said to him, If I want him to wait till I come, what is that to you? I want you to come and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>So the report went around among the brothers that that disciple would not die. Jesus had not said to him, You will not die. But he had said, If I want him to wait till I come, what is that to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>The same disciple said these things and wrote them. We know what he said is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>Jesus did many other things also. If every one were written down, I think that the world would be too small to hold all the books that would need to be written. Yes, it is so!</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>Theophilus, in the first book I wrote to you, I wrote about all the things Jesus began to do and to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>He did those things until the day he was taken up to heaven. Before he went up, he gave orders by the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>In many ways he proved to them that he was living again after his terrible death. For forty days they often saw him. Then he told them things about Gods kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>One day when he was eating with them, he told them not to leave Jerusalem. He said,  Wait here for what the Father promised you. I have told you about that promise already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>John baptised with water. But you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit when a few days have passed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>When they had come together, the apostles asked Jesus, Lord, are you now going to set up the kingdom of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>He answered them, You will not know the days or the months which the Father has chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>But when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, you will receive power. You will speak of me in Jerusalem and all around in Judea and Samaria and everywhere in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>When Jesus had said this, he went up. They watched him going. Then a cloud hid him,  and they did not see him any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>While they were looking at the sky as he went up, two men stood by them in white clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>They said, You men from Galilee, why do you stand there looking at the sky? Jesus has gone up into heaven. In the same way that you saw him go up, he will come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then they left the hill called the Mount of Olives. They went back to Jerusalem which was not far away. (It was how far the law said people may walk on the Sabbath day.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>When they reached Jerusalem, they went to a room up in a house. Here lived Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon the freedom fighter, and Judas the son of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>All of these people were talking to God. The women, Jesus mother Mary, and Jesus  brothers were there talking to God also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>About one hundred and twenty people were gathered together. Peter stood up among them to speak to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>He said, My friends and brothers, Judas showed the people where Jesus was so they could take him. The Holy Spirit spoke through king David long ago about Judas before he did it. What was written about him has now happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>Judas was one of us. He had his part of the work to do. (</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>Judas received money for the wrong thing he did. He bought a field with the money and fell on his face. His belly burst open and all his insides came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>All the people who live in Jerusalem know about this. In their language they named the field Akeldama, which means The Field of Blood.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>The book of Psalms says, "His house must be empty. No one may live in it." And it also says, "Someone else must do his work."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>Here are men who have been with us all the time that the Lord Jesus was with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>They were with us from the time John baptised people until the day Jesus was taken up from us. One of these men must help us tell people that Jesus was raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>They took two men. One was Joseph, named Barsabbas, who had another name Justus.  The other man was Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>Then the people talked to God. They said, Lord, you know what is in everybodys heart.  Show us which of these two men you have chosen to have a part in this work and to be an apostle. For Judas left this work and went to the place where he belonged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>Then they picked out the name of Matthias. He was chosen to be with the eleven apostles.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>On the day of Pentecost these people were all in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>Then, suddenly, a sound came from heaven. It was like a very strong wind blowing. It went all through the house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>And then they saw tongues like fire. These were divided and came on each one of the people there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit. They began to speak the words of God in other languages as the Spirit spoke through them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>Crowds of Jews were staying in Jerusalem. They had come from every country in the world. They were good men who believed in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>Many people came together when they heard the apostles speaking. They did not know what to think. Everyone heard someone speaking in his own language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>They were all very much surprised and said to each other, These men who are speaking,  are they not all from Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>How is it then that each one of us hears the language of our own country?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>We people from the countries of Parthia and Media and Elam all hear the wonderful things God has done. So also do the people who live in the countries of Mesopotamia,  and in Judea in Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, in Phrygia, and Pamphylia, and in Egypt, and in some parts of Lybia around Cyrene, people from the city of Rome who are now living in Jerusalem, both Jews and those who joined themselves to the Jews, the people from Crete and Arabia. These men from Galilee are speaking in our own languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>They were all very much surprised and could hardly believe it. What does this mean?  they asked each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>Other people laughed about it and said, These men have been drinking too much new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>Peter stood up with the eleven apostles. He shouted, You men of Judea and all who stay in Jerusalem, listen to me! I will tell you the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>You think that these men are drunk. That is not so. It is only nine oclock in the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>The thing that has happened is what the prophet Joel told about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>He said, "God says, In the last days I will send my Spirit on all people. I will speak through your sons and daughters. Your young men will see visions and your old men will have dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>In those days I will send my Spirit on the men and women who serve me and I will speak through them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>In the sky above and on the earth below I will show wonderful signs with blood and fire and clouds of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>The sun will be dark and the moon will be like blood. These things will happen before the day of the Lord comes. It will be a great day that will be remembered always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>And anyone who calls out to the Lord will be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>You men of Israel, listen to this. God showed you that he was pleased with this man,  Jesus of Nazareth. He proved it by the big works and the wonderful signs which he did by Jesus right here among you people. And you yourselves know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>This same Jesus was given up. You let bad men take him. You let them nail him to a cross and kill him. This is just the way God had planned it. He knew how it would happen. But God raised him back to life. He set him free from the pain of death. Death could not hold him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>King David spoke about Jesus long ago. He said, "I saw the Lord before me always. He is at my right hand so that I may not be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>That made my heart very happy. It made my tongue sing for joy. And even my body also will rest in peace because you will not leave my body in the grave. You will not let your Holy One die and be spoiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>You have shown me the ways of life. You will make me very happy when I am with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>My brothers, I can talk very plainly to you about your father, David. He died and was buried. His grave is still here today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>He was a prophet. He knew that God had promised him that someone born of his family would sit on his chair to rule. That one was Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>David knew what would happen. So he said that Christ would be raised from death.  Christ was not left in the grave. His body was not spoiled. David said all this before it ever happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>And now we all saw it. We are telling people that God raised this Jesus back to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>God made him great by making him sit at his right side. God gave him the Holy Spirit as he had promised. So he sent this which you now see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>David himself has not gone up into the heavens. What he said was, "The LORD God said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand till I bring your enemies down and put your feet on them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>So let all the people of Israel know this: God has made Jesus to be Lord and Christ. This is the same Jesus whom you nailed to the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>What Peter said cut the peoples hearts when they heard it. They knew they had done wrong. They said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brothers, what shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>Stop your wrong ways and turn back to God, answered Peter. And then everyone of you can be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ. Your wrong ways will be forgiven you,  and you will receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>This promise is for you and your children and for all those whom the Lord our God calls,  even though they are far away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>Peter went on talking and teaching the people. Do not follow the wrong ways of people today, he begged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>Then those who gladly received his words and believed were baptised. That same day about three thousand new believers joined them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>They kept on being taught by the apostles. And they kept on being with them. They ate bread together and talked with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>All the people were very much surprised. Many wonderful things and signs were done by the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>All the believers were together; and everything they had was for the use of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>They sold their things and divided the money among the believers. They gave each person what he needed. 46,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>And every day the believers kept on gathering in the temple. They ate bread in each others homes. They ate their food gladly and with open hearts. They praised God. All the people respected them. Day by day, the Lord added to the church those who were saved.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>One day at three oclock, Peter and John went to the temple to talk with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>There was a man who had been born lame. He was carried and was laid at the gate of the temple every day. The gate was called Beautiful. He was brought there to beg. He asked for money from the people who went into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>This man saw Peter and John ready to go into the temple. He begged them to give him something.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>Peter and John looked at him. Peter said, Look at us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>The man looked at them. He thought they would give him something.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>Then Peter said, I have no money. But I will give you what I have. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>He took the mans right hand and raised him up. Right away his feet and ankles became strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>He jumped to his feet and walked into the temple with them. He was so happy he jumped around and praised God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>All the people saw him walking and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>And they knew that this was the man who sat begging at the temple gate which was called Beautiful. They were very much surprised at what had happened to him. They could hardly believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>While the man still held on to Peter and John, all the people came running to them. It was in the part of the temple which is called Solomons porch. They were still very excited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>When Peter saw this, he talked to the people. He said, Men of Israel, why are you so surprised at this? Do you think that we have power or are good enough to make this man walk? Why do you look at us that way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and of our fathers, has made his Son Jesus great.  You gave him up to Pilate. You did not want to believe who he was. You did not want him back when Pilate agreed to let him go free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>You would not receive the one who was holy and good. You asked for a bad man, who killed people, to be given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>You killed the one who gives life, the one whom God brought back from death. We saw it and are telling people about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>This man whom you see and know, believed in the name of Jesus Christ. This mans faith in that name has healed him. Yes, believing in Jesus Christ has made him well here in front of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>My brothers, I know that you and your rulers killed Jesus because you did not understand what you were doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>But in this way God did what he had told us would happen. Through all the prophets he had told us that Christ would suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Stop doing wrong things. Turn to God again. Then the wrong things you have done will be wiped away altogether. The Lord will give you a new start and make you very glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>He will send you Jesus. He was the one God chose to be the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>But he must wait in heaven until the time when all things will be made new again as they were at first. By his holy prophets God spoke of all this from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>Moses himself said, "The Lord God will raise up for you a Prophet like me. He will be one of your brothers. You must listen to everything that the Prophet says to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>And everyone who does not obey that Prophet will be cut off from his people altogether."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>Prophets spoke at the time of Samuel, and prophets spoke after that time. They all have told about these days also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>You are the people who have received what the prophets promised. And you have received the agreement which God made with your fathers. He said to Abraham,  "Through your children all the nations of the earth will receive blessing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>God raised up and sent his Son to you first to bless you. He blesses you when each one of you stops doing wrong things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>Peter and John were talking to the people. The priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>They were angry at Peter and John because they taught the people. They were angry because they told them that Jesus was brought back from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>They caught them and put them in prison until the next day, because it was already evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>But many of the people who heard them speak the word of God, believed what they said.  The number of men who believed was about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>The next day their rulers, leaders, and scribes met in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all of the high priests family were there also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>Peter and John were brought before them. They asked the apostles, By what power or in what name have you done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and leaders of Israel, have you brought us to court today because of the good thing that was done to the lame man? Do you want to find out how he was healed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>Well, let it be known by all the people of Israel. This man standing before you is healed by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. He has done this. You nailed him to a cross, but God raised him from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>Jesus Christ is the stone which you, the builders, would not use. But he is now the chief corner stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>No one else can save us. Of all the people in the world, God chose him to save us. It is by him we must be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>They saw that Peter and John were not afraid to speak out. They knew that they were like any other men. They did not have much training. So the people were very much surprised. They knew that Peter and John had been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>They saw the man who had been healed standing beside them. So they could say nothing against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>They told Peter and John to leave the court. Then they talked the matter over among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>They said, What shall we do to these men? All the people who live in Jerusalem know about this big work they have done. And we cannot say they did not do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>But we do not want any more people to hear about it. So let us say to these men, "Take care! Never speak to anyone in this name again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>They called them in and said, Never speak or teach in this name again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John answered them, How does God look at it? Is it right for us to obey you or to obey him? You judge that for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>As for us, we must tell the things we have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>So the high priest and those with him told them again. Then they let them go. They could not punish them because of the people. They all praised God for what had been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>The man who had been healed was more than forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>When they were free, Peter and John went back to their own friends. They told them all that the chief priests and leaders had said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>When they heard it, they talked to God together. They said, Lord, you are God. You made the sky, and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>Our father David was your servant. Through him you said by the Holy Spirit, "Why are the people who are not Jews so angry? And why do the people plan things for nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings of the earth joined their forces. And the rulers met together against the Lord and his Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>It is true that Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with Jews and those who were not Jews here in this city. They met to make secret plans against your holy Son Jesus, whom you made Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>But they only did what you had already planned should be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>Lord, hear their words. Listen to the wrong things they say against us. We are your servants. Help us to speak your word without fear. And heal the sick by your own power.  Let signs and wonderful things be done in the name of your holy Son Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>When they had talked to God, the room they were in shook. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit. And they spoke the word of God without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>All the believers were one in heart and mind. Not one of them said, This is mine. But everything they had was for the use of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>With much power the apostles told how the Lord Jesus was raised from death. And God blessed them all very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>None of them was in need of anything. Those who owned fields and houses sold them.  They brought the money to the apostles. Then the apostles gave each one what he needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>There was a man named Joseph, a Levite. He was born in the country of Cyprus. The apostles called him Barnabas. That means "one who helps."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.37'>He had a field and sold it. He brought the money to the apostles and gave it to them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>A man named Ananias and his wife, Sapphira, sold a field. He brought some of the money to the apostles. But he kept the rest of it. His wife knew what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart? Why do you lie to the Holy Spirit?  You have kept some of the money which you got for the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>As long as you had the field, it belonged to you. When you had the money, you could do what you wanted to do with it. Why then did you plan to do a thing like this? You have not lied to men, but to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.5'>As Ananias heard Peters words, he fell down and died. All who heard these things were very much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.6'>The young men came and wrapped him up. They carried him out and buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.7'>About three hours later, his wife came in. She did not know what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.8'>Peter asked her, Tell me, did you sell the field for so much money? and she answered,  Yes, that is how much it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.9'>Then Peter said to her, Why did you two agree together to test the Spirit of the Lord?  Listen, I hear the footsteps of the men who buried your husband. They are at the door.  They will carry you out too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.10'>And she fell down at Peters feet and died. The young men came in and saw that she was dead. They carried her out and buried her beside her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>Then all the church people, and all the people who heard about this were very much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>The apostles did many signs and wonderful things for the people who met together in the place called Solomons porch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.13'>Other people feared to join them, but they spoke well of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>Many more men and women believed and came to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>They brought sick people out into the streets and laid them on beds and mats. They hoped that at least Peters shadow would touch them as he passed by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.16'>Many people also came from the cities around Jerusalem. They brought others who were sick and those who were controlled by bad spirits. Every one of them was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.17'>Some Sadducees were with the high priest. They all became very jealous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.18'>They caught the apostles and put them in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.19'>But that night the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.20'>Go, said the angel. Stand in the temple and tell the people all about this new life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>When the apostles heard that, they went into the temple early in the morning and taught the people there. The high priest and his men came. They called a meeting of the court and all the leaders of the Jews. Then they sent men to the prison to bring the apostles out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.22'>When the men came to the prison, they did not find the apostles there. Then they went back and told the high priest and those with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>They said, The prison was locked very well. And the police were guarding the doors.  But when we opened the doors, no one was inside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>When the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard this, they did not know what to think. We wonder what will come from all this, they thought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>Just then someone came and told them, The men you put in prison are standing in the temple teaching the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>Then the captain went with the men and brought the apostles quietly. They did not bring them by force because they were afraid the people would kill them with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.27'>So they brought them in and put them before the court. The high priest asked them, Did we not tell you that you must never teach again in this name? But here you are, teaching people all over Jerusalem in this name. You are trying to put on us the blame for this mans death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>Then Peter and the other apostles answered them, We must obey God rather than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, the one you killed by hanging on a dead tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.31'>God has made him great at his right side. He has made him leader and Saviour. He has done this so that the people of Israel may stop doing wrong things and be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.32'>We know these things are true. So does the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.33'>When the judges heard this, they were very, very angry and wanted to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>Then a lawyer named Gamaliel stood up in the court. He was a Pharisee and all the people respected him. He asked that the apostles be taken out for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.35'>Then he said, Men of Israel, you had better take care what you plan to do to these men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>Before this time, there was a man named Theudas. He tried to make people believe that he was a great man. He had about four hundred followers. He was killed, and all of his followers were scattered, and the whole thing ended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.37'>Then after that, at tax time, another man named Judas from Galilee made trouble. Many people followed him. He also was killed and all of his followers were scattered. 38,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.38'>So now, I say, do nothing to these men. Leave them alone. If this is the teaching or work of men, it will come to an end. But if it is of God, you cannot stop these men. You might even be fighting against God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.40'>They agreed to do what he said. They called in the apostles and had them beaten. They told them not to speak in the name of Jesus. Then they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.41'>The apostles left the court. They were very glad to think that God let them be punished for the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.42'>Every day, in the temple and in homes, they kept on teaching and talking about Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.6'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.1'>At that time more and more people joined the disciples. Then there was trouble about a certain matter. The Jews who spoke the Greek language complained against the other Jews. They said that each day when the food was being divided, their women whose husbands were dead did not get their part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.2'>Then the twelve apostles called all of the disciples together. They said, It is not right for us to stop preaching Gods word to divide the food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.3'>So then, brothers, you choose seven men who you know are good men. Choose men who are full of the Holy Spirit and are wise. We will give them the work to divide the food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.4'>But we ourselves will keep on talking with God and telling his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.5'>This pleased all the people. The men they chose were Stephen, a man who believed God and was full of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus from Antioch who had joined the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.6'>These men were brought before the apostles. When the apostles had talked with God,  they put their hands on their heads &lt;FI&gt;to bless them&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.7'>The word of God spread further and further, and many people in Jerusalem believed.  Many of the priests also believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.8'>Stephen received much blessing and power from God. He did many wonderful things and signs among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.9'>But some of the Jews argued with Stephen, and said he was wrong. (They belonged to the meeting place of the Free Men. They were Jews who came from Cyrene, Alexandria,  Cilicia and Asia Minor.) They did not agree with Stephen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.10'>But they could not say anything against his wise words and the Spirit by whom he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.11'>So they paid some people to say, We have heard him say wrong things about Moses and God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.12'>They talked to the people, the leaders, and the scribes, and made them angry. They went quickly and caught Stephen and took him into the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.13'>They brought in the men who told lies about him. They said, This man is always saying wrong things about this holy place and the laws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.14'>We have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will break down this place and that he will change the law which Moses gave us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.15'>Then all the judges who sat in the court looked at him and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.7'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.1'>Then the high priest asked, Is this true?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.2'>Stephen replied, Men, brothers and fathers, listen to me. When our father Abraham was in the country of Mesopotamia, before he lived in the country of Haran, the God who is great and wonderful came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.3'>God said, "Leave your country and your family and come to the country that I will show you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.4'>Then Abraham came out of the country of the Chaldeans and lived for a while in the country of Haran. After his father died, God led him from there to this country where you are living now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.5'>But God did not give any of the land to Abraham, not even a small part. But he promised that the land would belong to him. After him it would belong to his children, even though he did not have a child then.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.6'>This is what God told Abraham. He told him that his children would travel and live in another land. They would be slaves to the people there. They would have a hard time for four hundred years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.7'>And God said, "I will judge the people who make them slaves. After that, they will come out of that land and serve me here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.8'>God made the agreement of circumcision with Abraham. Abraham had a son Isaac. He made the mark of circumcision on the childs body and circumcised him on the eighth day. Isaac had a son Jacob, and Jacob had twelve sons who were our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.9'>Because they were jealous, they sold Joseph to be a slave in the country of Egypt. But God was with Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.10'>He took him out of all his troubles. He blessed him and made him wise in the eyes of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Pharaoh made him president in Egypt and a ruler over all the people of his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.11'>For a long, long time there was no rain in Egypt and Canaan. And so there was very little food. This caused much trouble. Our fathers had nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.12'>Then Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt. He sent his sons on their first trip to buy some. They were our fathers of long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.13'>The second time they went, Joseph told his brothers who he was. And Pharaoh found out who Josephs family was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.14'>Then Joseph sent for Jacob his father and all the family to come. There were seventy-five people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.15'>So Jacob went to Egypt. There he and our fathers died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.16'>They were taken back to the place called Shechem and buried. Abraham had bought a grave from the family of Hamor in Shechem. He had paid money for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.17'>Then it was almost time for God to do what he had promised to Abraham. The family of Jacob had become very large in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.18'>Then a new king who did not know Joseph ruled over Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.19'>This king was not kind to our fathers but he gave them a hard time. They had to put their babies outside to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.20'>Moses was born during that time. He was a very fine baby. For three months he was raised in his own fathers home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.21'>When he was put outside to die, Pharaohs daughter took him. She raised him as her own son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.22'>Moses was taught all the things the Egyptians knew. He knew how to talk and could do great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.23'>When he was forty years old he decided to visit his own family, the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.24'>There he saw one of them being hurt by an Egyptian. So he helped him. He fought for him and knocked down the Egyptian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.25'>He thought his people would know that God wanted him to make them free. But they did not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.26'>The next day he saw two of his own people fighting and he wanted to make peace. "You are brothers," he said. "Why are you fighting?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.27'>But the one who was fighting his neighbour pushed Moses away. He said, "Who made you our ruler and our judge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.28'>Do you want to kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.29'>When Moses heard these words, he left Egypt at once. He lived as a stranger in the country of Midian. While he was there, two sons were born to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.30'>When forty years had passed, he was in the wilderness near the hill called Sinai. There he saw fire in a small tree. An angel of the Lord was in the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.31'>Moses looked at it. He was very much surprised. He came closer to look at it better.  Then he heard the Lord speak to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.32'>The Lord said, "I am the God of your fathers. I am the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob." Moses began to shake. He was afraid to look.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.33'>Then the Lord said, "Take off your shoes. You are standing on holy ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.34'>I have looked and seen the trouble my people have in Egypt. I have heard them crying and I have come to make them free. Now come, I will send you to Egypt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.35'>This is the same Moses the people would not accept when they said, "Who made you our ruler and our judge?" This is the one God sent to be their ruler and to make them free when he spoke through the angel in the small tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.36'>It was Moses who led the people out of Egypt. He had done wonderful things and signs there, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness, for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.37'>This is the same Moses who said, "God will raise up one of your brothers to be a prophet, as he did me. Listen to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.38'>This is the same Moses who was with Gods people in the wilderness at the hill called Mount Sinai. He was with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers of long ago.It was he who received the words of life to give to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.39'>Our fathers would not obey Moses. They did not want him to lead them. They wished they were back in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.40'>They said to Aaron, "Make gods to lead us. We do not know what has happened to this Moses who brought us out of Egypt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.41'>They made a young cow at that time and gave sacrifices to this god which was not the true God. They were very happy. What they had made pleased them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.42'>Then God turned away from them. He let them worship the sun, moon, and the many stars in the sky. The prophets of God wrote about it long ago. They said, "You people of Israel, did you sacrifice animals to me forty years in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.43'>You carried the house of the god called Moloch and the star of the god called Rephan.  You made gods of them to worship. I will carry you away to the other side of Babylon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.44'>Our fathers had the tent for the laws of God in the wilderness. It was built the way God showed Moses to make it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.45'>Our fathers brought that tent with them when they came to this country. Joshua was their leader. God put aside the people who lived here first. Our fathers kept that tent with them until the time of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.46'>God blessed David who asked God to let him make a better house for Jacobs God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.47'>But it was Solomon who built a house for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.48'>But even so, God is above all. He does not live in houses that people make with their hands. The prophet says,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.49'>"The Lord said, The sky is the big chair from which I rule. I put my feet on the earth. So then, what kind of house will you build for me? Or where will I rest myself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.50'>I have made all these things myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.51'>You hard-hearted people! You have hearts and ears like the people who are not Jews.  You always fight against the Holy Spirit just as your fathers did long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.52'>What did your fathers do to the prophets of God? They made a lot of trouble for every one of them. They killed the ones who told that the Right and True One would come. He is the One you gave up to be killed. You are the killers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.53'>You received the law given by angels, but you have not kept it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.54'>When the men heard what Stephen said, they were very angry. They made noises with their teeth to show they hated him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.55'>But Stephen was full of the Holy Spirit. He looked at the sky and saw the greatness of God. He saw Jesus standing at Gods right side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.56'>Look, he said, I see the sky open. I see the Son of man standing at Gods right hand side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.57'>Then the men shouted. They put their fingers in their ears. All together they ran at Stephen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.58'>They put him out of the city and threw stones at him. (Those who had talked against him laid their clothes down by the feet of a young man named Saul.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.59'>They kept on throwing stones at Stephen. He spoke to God and said, Oh, Lord Jesus,  receive my spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.60'>Then he kneeled down and said in a loud voice, Lord, do not punish them for this wrong thing they are doing, After he said this, he died.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.8'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.1'>Saul agreed to Stephen being killed. At that time the church people at Jerusalem had much trouble. The church people all went into Judea and Samaria. Only the apostles stayed on at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.2'>Good men buried Stephen. They were very sad because he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.3'>Saul made much trouble for the church people. He went into every house, pulled out men and women, and put them into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.4'>The people who left Jerusalem went all around telling the good news about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.5'>Then Philip went to the city of Samaria and told people about Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.6'>And all the people together listened to what Philip said because they heard and saw the big works which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.7'>Many people who were held by bad spirits were made free from them. The spirits came out of them crying loudly. Many other sick people were healed too. People who could not stand, and others who were lame, were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.8'>The people all over the city were very glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.9'>But there was one man named Simon, a witch-doctor, who fooled the people of Samaria.  He tried to make people believe that he could do big things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.10'>And all the people, young and old, listened to him. They said, This man is a big power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.11'>He had fooled them for a long time with his work as a witch. That is why they listened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.12'>But Philip came and told them about Gods kingdom and the name of Jesus Christ. The people believed him. Then both men and women were baptised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.13'>Simon believed also. When he was baptised, he went with Philip. He was very much surprised when he saw the signs and the big works which were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.14'>Then the apostles at Jerusalem heard that the people of Samaria believed Gods word. So they sent Peter and John to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.15'>When they came to them, they prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.16'>Until that time, none of the people there had received the Holy Spirit. They had only been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.17'>Then the apostles put their hands on the people and they received the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.18'>Simon saw that the people received the Holy Spirit when the apostles put their hands on them. Then he brought money to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.19'>He said, Give me this power, too, so that anyone on whom I put my hands will receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.20'>Peter said, May you and your money be destroyed! You thought that you could buy the gift of God with money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.21'>You have no part in this matter. You cannot have any of this because God sees that your heart is not right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.22'>Stop your wrong ways. Ask the Lord. Perhaps God will forgive you for the wrong things you wanted to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.23'>I see that you are very bitter. Your wrong ways control you all together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.24'>Simon said, Ask the Lord for me, so that none of the things you have talked about will happen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.25'>The apostles told the people the word of the Lord. Then they went back to Jerusalem. On the way they told the good news in many villages in Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.26'>The angel of the Lord spoke to Philip. Get up, said the angel. Go south to the road that goes from Jerusalem to Gaza. It is desert there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.27'>So Philip went. He saw a man from the country of Ethiopia. This man was a servant of Candace, the queen of the Ethiopian people. She gave this servant much power. He took care of her money. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.28'>Now he was on his way back. He sat in his carriage reading from the book which was written long ago by Isaiah, the prophet of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.29'>The Spirit of the Lord said to Stephen, Go over to that man in the carriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.30'>So Philip went running to him. He heard him reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah.  Do you understand what you are reading? Philip asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.31'>How can I? I have no man to teach me, he answered. He asked Philip to get into the carriage and ride with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.32'>This is what he was reading: He was led as a sheep to be killed. A lamb says nothing while its wool is being cut, so he also says nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.33'>He was put down very low. He was not allowed to have a proper trial. He had no children to follow after him. For his life is taken from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.34'>Then the man from Ethiopia asked Philip, Please tell me, who is the prophet talking about, himself or some other man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.35'>Then Philip told him about Jesus. He began with what the man read in the book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.36'>While they were going along, they came to some water by the road. The man said, See,  here is water. What is there to stop me from being baptised?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.37'>Philip answered, If you believe with all your heart, you may be baptised. The man said,  I do believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.38'>The man told the driver to stop. Then both he and Philip went down into the water, and Philip baptised him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.39'>When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away. The man did not see him again, but he went on his way and was very happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.40'>Next, Philip came to the town of Azotus. He told the good news in all the cities through which he passed. Then he came to Caesarea.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.9'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.1'>Saul was still very angry with the Lords disciples. He said he would kill them. He went to the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.2'>He asked him for letters to take to the meeting places at Damascus. In this way he was given the power to catch any men or women disciples. He could tie them and bring them back to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.3'>He went on his way. All at once, near the city of Damascus, a light from the sky shone around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.4'>He fell to the ground and heard someone say, Saul, Saul, why are you troubling me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.5'>Saul said, Who are you, Lord? The Lord said, I am Jesus. You are troubling me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.6'>But get up and go to the city. There you will be told what you must do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.7'>The men who had come with Saul stood there. They did not say a word. They heard a voice but did not see anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>Saul got up off the ground. When he opened his eyes, he was blind. They took his hand and led him to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>For three days he could not see, and he did not eat or drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>A disciple named Ananias lived in Damascus. The Lord came to him in a vision and said.  Ananias. He replied, Here I am, Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>The Lord said, Go into the street which is called Straight. At the house of Judas, ask for a man named Saul, from the city of Tarsus. He is there, talking with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming to him. He has seen him put his hands on him so that he may see again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>Then Ananias replied, Lord, often I have heard of this man. He has brought much trouble to your people at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>The chief priests have given him power in this city to put into prison all those who call on your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>The Lord said, Go, I have chosen him to take my name to the people who are not Jews,  to kings, and to the people of Israel also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>I will show him how much he must suffer for my names sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>Then Ananias went. He went into the house and put his hands on Saul. He said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus came to you on the road while you were coming here. He has sent me to you so that you may see again, and that you may be filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>At once some kind of skin which had covered Sauls eyes came off. He was able to see again from then on. He got up and was baptised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>And when he had eaten food, he was strong again. Saul stayed for some days with the disciples at Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>Right away he went to the Jewish meeting places and told the people that Jesus is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>All the people who heard him were surprised. They said, This man killed the people who called on Jesus name in Jerusalem. He came here to catch them and tie them and take them to the chief priests!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>But Saul became stronger and stronger. He proved that Jesus is the Christ and made it so plain that the Jews at Damascus did not know what to say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>Then some time after that, the leaders of the Jews planned to kill Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>But he found out that they were waiting for him. The Jewish leaders watched the gates of the city night and day. They were waiting for a chance to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>Then one night the disciples put him in a basket and let him down outside the city wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>When Saul came to Jerusalem, he wanted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him. They did not believe that he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them, Saul has seen the Lord on the road. The Lord has talked to him. After that he told Gods word in the name of Jesus, without fear at Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.28'>So Saul stayed with the apostles and went around in Jerusalem. He told Gods word in the name of the Lord Jesus without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>He talked to the Jews who spoke the Greek language. But they did not agree with Saul,  and so they made plans to kill him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>After that, the churches in Judea, Galilee, and Samaria were not troubled any more and they believed more strongly. The people obeyed the Lord, and the Holy Spirit helped them to believe. And many more people joined them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>While Peter was travelling through all the towns, he came to visit Gods people who lived in the city of Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>There he saw a man named Aeneas who was sick. He could not stand up. He had been on his bed for eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed! The man got up at once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>All the people who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>In the city of Joppa there was a disciple. Her name was Tabitha. That means Dorcas or Gazelle. She did much good work and she gave many things to the poor people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>Lydda was near Joppa. When the disciples heard that Peter was at Lydda, they sent two men and asked for him to come quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>Peter got up and went with them. When he got there, they took him to the room upstairs.  Women whose husbands were dead stood there crying. They showed Peter the clothes and coats that Dorcas had made for them while she was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>Peter put them all out. He kneeled down and talked to God. He turned to the body and said, Tabitha, get up. She opened her eyes. When she saw Peter, she sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>He took her hand and helped her get up. Then he called in Gods people and the women,  and he gave her back to them alive.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>In Caesarea lived a man named Cornelius. He was a big captain in the army. His soldiers were called the Italian Group.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>He was a good man. He and all the people of his house obeyed God. He gave many gifts to the poor. He always talked with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>About three oclock one afternoon, he clearly saw an angel from God coming to him in a vision. Cornelius, said the angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>Cornelius looked at him. He was afraid and asked, What is it, Sir? The angel answered him, God has heard what you said to him. He has remembered your gifts to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>Send men to Joppa to call Simon, whose other name is Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>He is staying with Simon, the man who makes skins into leather. His house is by the sea.  Peter will tell you what you should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>When the angel which spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his house servants.  He also called one of the soldiers who believed in God and who always helped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>He told them carefully all about his vision. Then he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>They went the next day. They were coming near to the city. About midday, Peter went up on the flat roof of the house to talk with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>He became very hungry and wanted to eat. While food was being made ready, something like a dream came over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>He saw the sky open. A bundle like a big blanket was tied by the corners. It was let down to earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>In the bundle were all kinds of animals and snakes and birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>Then Peter heard a voice saying to him, Get up, Peter. Kill some and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>But Peter said, No, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is not holy or not clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>Then the voice spoke to him again, saying, What God has made clean you must not call unholy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>This happened three times. Then the thing was taken up right away into the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>I have seen a strange thing, Peter said to himself. I wonder what it all means. He was thinking about all this. And the men whom Cornelius sent had asked the way to Simons house. Now they stood at the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>Is this where Simon Peter is staying? they called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>Peter was still thinking about what he had seen. Then the Spirit of God said to him,  Three men are looking for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>Get up. Go down and go with them. Do not fear to go, because I have sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>Then Peter went down to the men whom Cornelius had sent to him. He said, Here I am.  You are looking for me. Why have you come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>They answered, God sent a holy angel to Cornelius. He told him to call you to his house and hear what you have to say. Cornelius is a captain in the army. He is a good man. He does what is right and obeys God. All the Jews speak well of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>Peter said, Come in. He had them stay as his guests. The next day he and some of the Christian brothers from Joppa went with the men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>The day after that, they reached Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them. He had called his family and close friends together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>Peter was about to enter the house. Cornelius met him. He kneeled down at his feet and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>But Peter raised him up and said, Please stand up. I too am only a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>Peter talked to him and went in with him. He saw many people who had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>He began to talk with them. He said, You yourselves know it is against our law for a Jew to visit and be friends with someone who is not a Jew. But God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>So when you sent for me, I did not say "No". Now I ask, why did you send for me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>Cornelius answered, Four days ago, it was just at this time, three oclock. I was in my house talking with God. I had not eaten any food. A man stood in front of me wearing shining clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>He said to me, "Cornelius, God has heard what you said to him. He has remembered your gifts to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>Send men to Joppa to call for Simon Peter. He is staying with Simon, the man who makes skins into leather. His house is by the sea."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>So I sent for you right away. You have done well to come. Now we are all here before God to hear all that the Lord has told you to tell me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>Then Peter began to speak, I really understand now. God does not love some people more than others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>But he takes anyone who obeys him. He takes anyone who does what is right. It does not matter to what nation they belong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>To the people of Israel God has sent the good news. He gives peace through Jesus Christ.  He is Lord of all!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>You yourselves know the story of what happened all through Judea. It started in Galilee after the baptism which John talked about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>God gave Jesus of Nazareth the Holy Spirit and power. Jesus went about doing good deeds. He healed all those who were held by the devil. God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>We saw all the things which he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. And they hung him on a piece of wood and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>On the third day, God raised him up to let people see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>Not all the people saw him. But God had chosen us to see and to talk about him. We saw him. We ate and drank with him after he rose from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>He told us to tell the people that God chose him to judge both the living people and the dead people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>All the prophets tell about him. They say, "Everyone who believes in him will have his wrong ways forgiven through his name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter was saying this, the Holy Spirit came on all those who heard the message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>The believers who came with Peter were Jews. They were very much surprised that the Holy Spirit was also sent to those who were not Jews. 46,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>They heard them speak in tongues of other languages and praise God. Then Peter said,  These people have received the Holy Spirit just as we have. Can anyone say they may not be baptised in water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>So he said they were to be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ. They begged him to stay with them for a while.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>The apostles and other Christian brothers were in Judea. They heard that some people who were not Jews had also believed Gods message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>When Peter went back to Jerusalem, the leaders of the Jews found fault with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>They asked, Why did you visit people who are not Jews? Why did you eat with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>Peter explained to them all that had happened from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>I was in the city of Joppa talking with God, he said. Something like a dream came over me. I saw a vision. I saw a bundle like a big blanket tied by the corners. It was let down from the sky. It came down to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>When I looked at it, I wondered about it. I saw different kinds of tame animals, wild animals, snakes, and birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>And I heard a voice say to me, "Get up, Peter. Kill some and eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>But I said, "No, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is not holy or clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>Then the voice spoke from the sky a second time, saying, "What God has made clean,  you must not call unholy."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>This happened three times. Then everything was taken up into the sky again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>Right then three men came to the house where we were. They had come from Caesarea for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>The Spirit told me to go with them and not to fear. These six brothers went with me too.  We went into the mans house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>He told us that he had seen Gods angel standing in his house. The angel said to him,  "Send men to Joppa to call Simon whose other name is Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.14'>He will tell you and all your family how to be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>And when I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them just as he had come on us at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>Then I remembered that the Lord said, "John baptised with water, but you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>God gave then the same gift as he gave to us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. If God gave them this gift, how could I stop him? I am only a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>When the people heard this, they were satisfied. They praised God saying, God has allowed the people who are not Jews to turn to him and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>Some of the people had gone to other countries because of the big trouble when Stephen was killed. They went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch. They told Gods word to the Jews only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene. They went to Antioch. They also spoke to those who were not Jews, and they told them about the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>The Lord was with them. Many believed and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>The people in the Jerusalem church heard this news. They sent Barnabas to go to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>When he reached there, he saw what had been done by the power of God. He was very glad. He talked to them. He begged them all to keep on following the Lord with all their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>Barnabas was a good man. He believed in God and was filled with the Holy Spirit. Many people came to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to get Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>When he found him, he took him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with all who believed in Jesus Christ. They taught many people. Antioch was the first place where the disciples were called Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>At that time, prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>One of them named Agabus stood up. He told them the Spirit had shown him that much trouble would come to all the world. There would not be much food for the people. (This trouble came when Claudius Caesar was ruler.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>Then the disciples decided to help the Christian brothers who lived in Judea. They would each one send what he could.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.30'>They did so. They sent Barnabas and Saul to carry it to the church leaders &lt;FI&gt;in Jerusalem&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.12'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.1'>At that time Herod the king caught some of the church people and troubled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>He killed James the brother of John with a long knife or sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>He saw that this pleased the leaders of the Jews, so he caught Peter also. This happened at the Jewish feast which they had each year to remember leaving Egypt. (It was called the Passover Feast.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>After Herod had caught Peter, he put him in prison. He told four groups of soldiers to guard him. There were four soldiers in each group. He planned to bring him out for trial before the people. But he would do it after the Passover Feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>So Peter was kept in prison. And the church people asked God to help him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>The night before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers. He was tied to them with two chains. Guards were at the door of the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>An angel from the Lord came to him and a light shone in the prison. He hit Peters side and woke him up. Be quick, he said. Get up! His chains fell off his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>Put on your belt and your shoes, said the angel. Peter did so. And now, said the angel,  put on your coat and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>Peter followed him out. He did not know that what the angel had done was true. He thought he was dreaming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>They passed the first and the second guard. Then they came to the iron gate out to the city. It opened for them by itself. So they went all the way down a street. Then the angel left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>When Peter came to himself, he said, Now I know truly that the Lord has sent his angel.  He has saved me from Herod and from all that the Jewish leaders are hoping will happen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>And when he thought about this, he went to Marys house. Mary was John Marks mother. Many people were meeting there, talking to God &lt;FI&gt;about Peter&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>Peter knocked at the outside door. A young servant woman named Rhoda went to answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>When she knew it was Peters voice, she was very glad. She did not open the door. But she ran in and told the people that Peter was at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>They said, You are crazy. But she kept on saying that Peter was really there. Then they said, It must be his angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>Peter kept on knocking. When they opened the door and saw him, they were very much surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>He put out his hand for them to be quiet. Then he told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He said, Tell James and the brothers about this. Then he went away to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>In the morning the soldiers tried hard to find Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>Herod had looked for him and had not found him. So he questioned the guards and ordered them to be taken away and killed. And then Peter went from Judea to Caesarea to live for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. But they got Blastus to speak to the king for them. Blastus was one of the men who worked in the kings house. They came to Herod together. They wanted to make peace with him because their country got its food from his country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>On a certain day Herod put on his kings robes and sat on his chair and made a speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>The people shouted, A god is talking to us. He is not a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.23'>At once an angel from God put a bad sickness on Herod because he did not give God the praise. Worms ate him and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.24'>The word of God spread further and further and more people believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.25'>Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had finished their work. They brought John Mark with them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.13'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.1'>In the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers. They were Barnabas, Simeon Niger, Lucius from Cyrene, Manaen who grew up with Herod the ruler, and Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.2'>They were worshipping the Lord and fasting &lt;FI&gt;not eating food for a time&lt;Fi&gt; . The Holy Spirit said, Give me Barnabas and Saul to do the work for which I have called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.3'>The men fasted and talked to God. Then they laid their hands on Barnabas and Paul and sent them on their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.4'>Barnabas and Saul left Antioch. The Holy Spirit sent them to the town of Seleucia. From there they went in a boat to the island of Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.5'>When they reached the town of Salamis, they told Gods word in the meeting places of the Jews. John was with them to help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.6'>They went through all the island to the town of Paphos. There they met a witch doctor.  He was a Jew named Bar-Jesus. He was not a true prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.7'>This witch-doctor was with Sergius Paulus, the ruler of the country. Sergius Paulus was a wise man. He wanted to hear Gods word, so he called for Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.8'>The witch-doctor was also called Elymas. He tried to stop them. He did not want the ruler to believe the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.9'>Then Saul, who is also called Paul, being filled with the Holy Spirit, looked at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.10'>You son of the devil! he said. You do nothing but tell lies and make much trouble. You hate everything that is right. The Lords way is right. Will you not stop spoiling his way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.11'>See now, the Lords hand is upon you. You will be blind and will not be able to see the sun for a while. And right then something like a dark cloud came over Elymas eyes. He went around begging someone to take his hand and lead him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.12'>The ruler saw what had happened. And he was very much surprised at the teaching about the Lord. He believed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.13'>Paul and his friends left Paphos in a boat. They went to the town of Perga in the district of Pamphylia. There John left them and went back to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.14'>The others went on from Perga. They came to Antioch in the district of Pisidia. On the Sabbath day they went into the meeting house and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.15'>First, someone read from the books of the law and the prophets. Then the rulers of the meeting house called Paul and Barnabas and said, Men and brothers, have you something to say that will help us? Please say it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.16'>Then Paul stood up and put out his hand. He said, Men of Israel and you who worship and fear God, please listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.17'>The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers. He made the people into a large tribe when they were strangers in the land of Egypt. God brought them out of Egypt by his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.18'>For forty years in the wilderness God cared for them like a father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.19'>God took seven tribes out of the land of Canaan. Then he divided the land among our people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.20'>God gave judges to rule over them until Samuel the prophet came. About four hundred and fifty years had passed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.21'>Then the people asked for a king. God gave them Saul. He was the son of Kish, a man from Benjamins family. Saul was their king for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.22'>Then God took him away. He made David king over them. This is what God said about him, "David, Jesses son, is the kind of man I love. He will do all that I want him to do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.23'>God has given Israel a Saviour from Davids family, as he promised to do. His name is Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.27'>The people who live in Jerusalem and their rulers did not know who this Jesus really was.  They did not understand the words of the prophets of God long ago which were read every Sabbath day. But even so, they did what the prophets had said they would do.  They judged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.28'>They could not prove that he did anything wrong for which he should die. Yet they begged Pilate to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.29'>They did all the things that the prophets had written about him. Then they took him down from the cross made from a tree. They laid him in a grave cut from the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.30'>But God raised him from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.31'>People had come with Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem. They saw him many days. Now they tell people what they saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.32'>And we are bringing you this good news. God made a promise to our fathers long ago.  Now he has made his promise come true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.33'>We, their children, have now received the promise. He sent Jesus just as it was written in the second psalm, "You are my Son. Today I have become your Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.34'>God raised Jesus from death. His body did not go back to the grave to be spoiled. Here is what God said about it. "I will give to you the blessings which I promised David."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.35'>In another psalm it says, "You will not let the body of your Holy One be spoiled."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.36'>As for David, he did the work God wanted him to do for the people in his time. Then,  after that, he died. He was buried with his fathers. His body spoiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.37'>But God has raised one from death. His body did not spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.38'>Men and brothers, understand this. It is because of this Jesus that we tell you your wrong ways will be forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.39'>The law of Moses could not make you free. But this man makes you free. You will not be judged if you believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.40'>Be careful then, so that what the prophets said will not happen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.41'>They said, "Look, you people who despise everything. You will look in wonder before you die. I will do something in your time. I will do something that you will not believe even if someone told you what it is."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.42'>As Paul and Barnabas left the meeting house the people said, Tell us these things again next Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.43'>The meeting was finished. There were many Jews, also those who were not Jews but worshipped God. They followed Paul and Barnabas. Paul and Barnabus kept talking to the people and told them to keep on living in the way that will bring Gods blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.44'>The next Sabbath day almost all of the people in that city gathered to hear Gods word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.45'>The leaders of the Jews saw that many people came. They were very jealous. They talked back to Paul and said he was not telling the truth. They also said wrong things about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.46'>But Paul and Barnabas did not fear the Jewish leaders. They said, We had to tell Gods word to you first but you will not listen to it. By that you are saying you Jews are not good enough to live for ever. So we will go to the people who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.47'>That is what the Lord told us to do. He said, "I have made you to be a light to the people who are not Jews. You will tell people everywhere in the world how to be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.48'>Those who were not Jews heard this. They were glad and they thanked God for his message. All those who had been chosen to live for ever believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.49'>The word of the Lord was told through all that part of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.50'>But the leaders of the Jews talked to the leading women who worshipped God and to the chief men of Antioch. They made plenty of trouble for Paul and Barnabas. They made them leave that part of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.51'>So Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet and left them. They went on to Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.52'>And the followers were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.14'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.1'>In Iconium Paul and Barnabas did as they had done before in other places. They went into the Jews meeting place and spoke. Many of the Jews and the other people believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.2'>But the Jews who did not believe said wrong things about them. They spoiled the minds of those who were not Jews so that they hated the Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.3'>Paul and Barnabas stayed there a long time anyway. They did not fear to talk about the Lord. The Lord proved that the message about his blessing was true. He worked through Paul and Barnabas. They did signs and wonderful things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.4'>The people of the city were divided. Some of them agreed with the Jewish leaders. Some of them agreed with the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.5'>Then some of those people who were not Jews joined together with the Jews and their leaders. They made a plan to give the apostles much trouble and to kill them with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.6'>Paul and Barnabas found out about this. So they left quickly. They went to Lystra and Derbe in the district of Lycaonia and the country around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.7'>There they told people the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.8'>At Lystra a man was sitting. He was not able to walk because he had no strength in his feet. He had never walked since he was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.9'>This man heard Paul speak. Paul looked at the man. He saw that the man believed he would be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.10'>Paul said, Stand up on your feet! The man jumped up and walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>When the people saw what Paul had done, they shouted in their own language, The gods have become like men! They have come down to visit us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.12'>They named Barnabas, Jupiter. And they named Paul, Mercury, because he was the one who talked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.13'>There was a temple of Jupiter in front of the city. The priest of the temple brought animals and flowers to the gates to make a sacrifice. All the people were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.14'>But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes and ran in among the people shouting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.15'>They said, Why are you people doing this? We are only men like you. You should leave these gods which cannot help you. You should turn to the living God. He made the sky,  the earth, the sea, and all that is in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.16'>In the time that is past, God allowed all people to do what they wanted to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.17'>But even then he had some ways to make himself known. He did things that were good.  He gave us rain from the sky and good harvests. And he gives you all the food you need and makes you very happy. Surely these things speak for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.18'>By saying these things they stopped the people from making sacrifices to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.19'>Some of the Jewish leaders from Antioch and Iconium came to Lystra and won the people to their side. They threw stones at Paul. Then they carried him out of the city because they thought he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.20'>But as the disciples gathered around him, he got up and they went back into the city. The next day Paul and Barnabas left and went to Derbe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.21'>They told the good news to the people in Derbe. Many people believed what they taught.  Then they went back to Lystra, to Iconium. and to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.22'>They talked to the disciples to help them. They told them to keep on believing. They said,  We must go through much trouble to get into Gods kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.23'>They chose leaders for them in every church. They talked with God and fasted. When they were finished, they gave the leaders over to the Lords care, because they believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.24'>They went through the district of Pisidia to Pamphylia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.25'>They told the good news to the people in Perga. Then they went to the town of Attalia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.26'>From there they went in a boat to Antioch. It was there that the people had given them over to Gods care. They had asked him to bless them in this work. Now they had finished the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.27'>When they reached the city, they called all the church people together. They told them all that God had done for them. They said, Now God has opened the way to believe for those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.28'>Paul and Barnabas stayed a long time with the disciples at Antioch.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.15'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.1'>Some men came from Judea and taught the Christian brothers. They said, You must be circumcised with the mark made on your body in the way Moses taught us. If you are not circumcised you cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.2'>Paul and Barnabas did not agree with them. There was much talking about it. Then they decided that Paul and Barnabas and some of the other men should go to Jerusalem. They would ask the apostles and church leaders there about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.3'>So the church people sent them on their way. They passed through the districts of Phoenicia and Samaria. They told them that some who were not Jews were believing in God. This news made all the Christian brothers very happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.4'>When they reached Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church people, the apostles,  and the church leaders. They told all that God had done as he worked with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.5'>But some of the believers who belonged to the Pharisee group stood up and said, They must be circumcised &lt;FI&gt;like the Jews&lt;Fi&gt; . We must tell them to keep all the laws of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.6'>The apostles and the church leaders met together to talk the matter over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>After much talking about it, Peter stood up. He said, Men and brothers, you know what happened in the first days. God chose me to tell the good news to those who are not Jews. They believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.8'>God knows what is in a persons heart. He proved that they believed. He gave them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.9'>God made no difference between them and us. He made their hearts clean when they believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.10'>So now why are you doing what God did not do? You give the disciples a hard thing to do. Our fathers could not do it. And we cannot do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.11'>We believe that the Lord Jesus saves us because he is kind. And that is why he saves them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.12'>Then all the people stopped talking. They listened to what Paul and Barnabas had to say.  They told them about all the signs and wonderful things that God had helped them to do among the people who were not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.13'>When they had finished talking, James said, Men and brothers, listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.14'>Simeon has told us how God came the first time to the people who are not Jews. God chose some of them to belong to him and be his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.15'>This is what the prophets of God said long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.16'>They said, "After this, I will come back and build up again the house of David which has fallen down. I will take the broken pieces and build a house again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.17'>Then all the other people will find God, even those who are not Jews but who belong to me. So says the Lord, who is doing all these things."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.18'>He told us these things long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.19'>So now, this is what I think. We should not trouble those who are not Jews but who have turned to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.20'>We should write them a letter and tell them what they must not do. They must not eat food that has been given to idols. They must not have sex with someone who is not their husband or wife. They must not eat the meat of animals that are killed by choking. They must not taste blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.21'>Since the times of long ago there have been men who told about Moses in every city.  They read his laws in the meeting places every Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.22'>Then the apostles, and the leaders, and all the church people chose men from among themselves. They sent them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas,  whose other name was Barsabbas, and Silas. They were leaders among the Christian brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.23'>They sent a letter with them. It said, The apostles, the church leaders, and the Christian brothers send greetings to the Christians who are not Jews in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.24'>We have heard that some of our people visited you and talked to you. They taught things that troubled you and made you believe wrong things. They said, "You must be circumcised like the Jews and keep the law." We did not tell them to teach you this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.25'>All of us gathered here have chosen some men. We are sending them with our dear brothers, Barnabas and Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.26'>Barnabas and Paul have been willing to die for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>We are sending Judas and Silas. They will tell you the same things that we have written in the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.28'>The Holy Spirit and we thought it was not good to give you a hard thing to do. But here is what you must not do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.29'>You must not eat food that has been given to idols. You must not eat the meat of animals that are killed by choking. You must not taste blood. You must not commit adultery. If you keep away from these things, you will do well. Goodbye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.30'>So the men left and went to Antioch. There they called the people together and gave them the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.31'>When the people read the letter, they were very glad. It helped them to become stronger in what they believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.32'>Judas and Silas were prophets. They said many things to the Christian brothers and helped them to believe more strongly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.33'>They stayed there for a while. Then the brothers sent them back to those who had sent them. They sent a greeting of peace with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.34'>But Silas thought it was good to stay at Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.35'>Paul and Barnabas stayed there too. They taught the people and told them the Lords message. Many other men did this also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.36'>Some days later, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go back and visit the brothers in every city where we have told the Lords message. Let us see how they are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.37'>Barnabas wanted to take John Mark with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.38'>But Paul did not think that they should take him. John Mark had left them when they were at Pamphylia. He had not gone along with them to do the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.39'>The feeling about this matter was very strong between Barnabas and Paul, so they did not go together. Barnabas took Mark and went in a boat to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.40'>Paul chose Silas. The Christian brothers asked the Lord to bless Paul. Then he went on his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.41'>Paul travelled through Syria and Cilicia. He helped the church people to believe more strongly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>Then he came to Derbe and Lystra. A disciple named Timothy was there. His mother was a Jew, a believer, and his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.2'>The Christian brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke very well of Timothy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Paul wanted him to go with him. He circumcised him because all the Jews in those places knew that his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>They went from town to town and talked to the people. They told them what the apostles and church leaders at Jerusalem had said should be done. So the church people became stronger in what they believed. Every day more people joined the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.5'>missing fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.6'>Paul and Silas went through the district of Phrygia and Galatia. The Holy Spirit said they should not tell Gods word in the country of Asia Minor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.7'>After they came to the district of Mysia, they wanted to go to the country of Bithynia but the Holy Spirit did not allow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>So they went by Mysia and came to the city of Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>In the night Paul had a vision: he saw a picture like a dream. He saw a man of Macedonia standing and calling to him, Come over into Macedonia and help us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.10'>After Paul had seen the vision, we tried to leave for Macedonia right away. We believed that the Lord had called us to tell the people there the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.11'>So we left Troas in a boat and went straight across the water to the town of Samothrace.  The next day we went to Neapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.12'>From there we went to Philippi. This was the big city of the district of Macedonia. It was a free city. We stayed there for some time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>On the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the river. We thought this was a place where people met to talk with God. So we sat down and talked to the women who had come there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>One woman named Lydia listened to us. She was from the city of Thyatira, and she sold red cloth. She worshipped God. He worked in her heart and she believed what Paul said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>She and all the people in her house were baptised. Then she begged us and said, If you really feel that I believe in the Lord, come and stay at my house. And she would not allow us to say no.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>One day we were going to the meeting place where people talked with God. We met a girl who had a bad spirit. She used to tell people what was going to happen. Her masters received much money when she did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>This girl kept on following Paul and us. She was shouting, These men are servants of the High God. They are telling us how to be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>She did this for many days. This troubled Paul. He turned and said to the spirit in her, In the name of Jesus Christ, I say to you, come out of her! And the spirit came out at once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>Her masters saw that they had lost this way of getting money. They caught Paul and Silas and took them by force to the rulers in the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>When they had brought them before the judges, they said, These men are Jews. And they are making much trouble in our city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>They are teaching people laws which we may not obey because we are Roman people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>All the people standing around were against Paul and Silas. The judges tore off the clothes of Paul and Silas. They gave orders that they should be beaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>They beat them very hard. Then they put them in prison. Take care, they said to the prison guard. Be sure that these prisoners do not run away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>And so the guard put them in the back room in the prison. They locked their feet in holes cut in heavy pieces of wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>At midnight, Paul and Silas were talking with God. They were singing and praising God.  The other prisoners were listening to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>Then all of a sudden the earth shook very much. Even the floor of the prison was shaking. All the doors came wide open. The things that held the prisoners all came off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>The prison guard woke up. He saw all the prison doors open. So he took a long knife and was going to kill himself. He thought that all the prisoners had run away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.28'>Paul shouted, Stop! Do not hurt yourself. We are all here!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>The guard called for a light and went in quickly. He kneeled down before Paul and Silas,  trembling with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>He brought them out of the prison and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>They replied, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved. All the people in your house must do the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>They talked to him and all the people in the house. They told them the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>Paul and Silas had sores from the beating in prison. So that same hour of the night the guard washed them. Then he and all the people of his house were baptised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>He took Paul and Silas to his home and gave them food to eat. He and all the people in his house were very happy. They now believed in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>In the morning the judges sent soldiers to the guard with a message. Let those men go free, they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>The guard told Paul. He said, The judges have sent a message that you may go free. So now, come out and go on your way. You will have no more trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But Paul said, We are Romans. And they have beaten us outside where people can see.  They have put us in prison without proving we have done wrong. Now, are they going to take us out of prison secretly? No, they themselves must come and take us out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>The soldiers told this to the judges. They were very much afraid when they heard that Paul and Silas were Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>So they came to Paul and Silas. They said they were sorry for what they had done. They brought them out of prison and asked them to leave the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>When Paul and Silas came out of prison, they went back to Lydias house. They saw their Christian brothers and talked to them. This helped the Christians to believe more strongly.  Then Paul and Silas went on their way.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>Paul and Silas went through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia. Then they reached the town of Thessalonica. Here the Jews had a meeting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>As he had done in other places, Paul went into it. On three Sabbath days he explained what was written in the holy writings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>He proved these things from the writings. He said. It was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise again from death. And this Jesus, whom I am talking about, is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>Some of the people believed him and they followed Paul and Silas. Some of them were Greek people who worshipped God. And some were leading women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But some Jews did not believe, and they were jealous. So they called some of the bad men together and made a crowd. They started to fight and to make plenty of trouble and noise in the city. At Jasons house they went in by force to find Paul and Silas. They wanted to bring them outside to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>But they did not find them. So they took Jason and some of the Christian brothers to the rulers of the city. They shouted, These men have turned the world upside down. Now they have come here also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>Jason has taken them into his house. None of them obeys the laws of Caesar. They say there is another king named Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>All the people and the rulers of the city became angry when they heard this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>They made Jason and the other Christians pay much money. Then they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>That night the Christian brothers sent Paul and Silas to the town of Berea. When they reached there, they went into the Jews meeting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>The people in Berea were better than the people of Thessalonica. They were glad to listen to Pauls words. Every day they studied the holy writings to see if what Paul said was right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>Through this, many of them believed. Some of the leading women of the Greek people and some of the men also believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>The leaders of the Jews in Thessalonica heard that Paul told the word of God to the people at Berea. They came to Berea and talked to the people. They said things that made the people very angry against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>The Christian brothers sent Paul to the seaside right away. But Silas and Timothy stayed on at Berea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>The men took Paul to the city of Athens. Paul told them to tell Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as they could.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>Paul was waiting for Silas and Timothy at Athens. He saw that the city was full of idols.  His spirit was troubled about this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>In the meeting place he talked with the Jews and those who believed in the true God. In the market every day, he talked to people he met there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>There were some wise men who believed the teachings of Epicurius. They believed the teaching of other wise men called Stoics. Some of them began to talk with Paul. And some said, What does this talker have to say? Others said, He seems to be talking about new gods. This was because he was telling them about Jesus and how he was raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>So they took Paul and brought him to a meeting at the hill called Areopagus. They said,  We want to know what this new teaching is that you are talking about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>You are telling us things we never heard before. We want to understand them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>All the people of Athens and the strangers who lived there passed their time in one way.  They liked to tell and to hear some new thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>Then Paul stood up in the court and said, You men of Athens, I see that you are very religious and worship many gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>As I walked about, I looked at the things you worship. I saw one place where you make sacrifices. You have written on it, "To the God we do not know." You are worshipping that God, but you do not know him. I will tell you about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>He made the world and everything in it. He is the Lord of the sky and the earth. He does not live in houses that people make with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>Men cannot worship him by things they make with their hands because he does not need anything. He is the one who gives life and breath and everything else to all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>God made one man. From that one man he has made all the nations of men to live on the whole earth. He has given to each nation a certain time and a certain place to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>He did this so they would look for him. He wanted them to reach out and find him. But he is not far from each one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>In him we live, and move, and are alive. Some of your own writers have said, "We have come from him".</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>Therefore we have all come from God. So we should not think that God is something made of gold, or silver, or stone. He is not made by mens hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>In times past God did not look at what people did. They did not know any better then.  But now he is calling all people to stop doing those things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>God has set a day when he will judge the whole world in the right way. He has chosen a man to do this. He has proved to all people who the man is. He has raised him from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>When the people of Athens heard that someone had been raised from death, some of them laughed. Others said, We want to hear you talk about this matter again some time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>So then Paul left them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>But some men followed him and believed. Among those who believed was Dionysius. He was a judge in the Areopagus court. And a woman named Damaris believed. There were others also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>After this Paul left Athens and went to the city of Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>There he met a Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus. A short time before this he and his wife Priscilla had come from the country of Italy. They left Italy because Claudius the ruler had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. This was the big city in Italy. Paul went to the house of Aquila and Priscilla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>Pauls work had been the making of tents, and that is what they did. So he stayed with them. They worked together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>Every Sabbath day he talked with the people in the meeting place for the Jews. He tried to talk so that the Jews and the Greeks would believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul felt in his heart that he must prove to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>But the people talked back to Paul. And they said wrong things about him. Paul shook his clothes and said to them, If you are lost, it is your own fault, not mine! From now on I will go to those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>So he left. He went to the house of a man named Justus who worshipped God. His house was next to the meeting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>Crispus was the head ruler of the meeting house. He and his whole family believed in the Lord. Many of the people in Corinth heard and believed. And they were baptised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>The Lord said to Paul in a vision in the night, Do not fear. Keep on speaking. Do not stop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>I am with you. nobody will hurt you. I have many people in this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>So Paul stayed there for one year and six months. He taught the people Gods word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>When Gallio was the ruler of the province of Achaia, the Jews got together to stop Paul.  They took him to court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>They said, This man is talking to the people. He is trying to make them worship God in a way that is against our law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>Paul wanted to speak. Then Gallio said to the Jews, You Jews, if it were a matter of wrong or of doing something very bad, I would listen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>But this is a matter about words and names and about your own law. So you must go and take care of it yourselves! I will not judge such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>And he drove them out of the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>They caught a man. His name was Sosthenes. He was the head ruler of the meeting house. They beat him in front of the judge, but Gallio did nothing about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>Paul stayed there for many days. Then he said goodbye to the Christian brothers and went in a boat to the country of Syria. Priscilla and Aquila went with him. In the town of Cenchrea he cut his hair off. This was because he had made a promise to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>When they reached the city of Ephesus, Paul left the others there. He himself went to the meeting place and talked with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>The Jews begged him to stay longer but he would not stay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>Goodbye, he said. I will come back to you again if it is Gods will. Then he got in a boat and left Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>When he reached Caesarea, he went to greet the church people. Then he went on to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>He stayed there for a while. Then he left and went through all the countries of Galatia and Phrygia. He helped the disciples to believe more strongly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>A Jew came to Ephesus. His name was Apollos. He was born in Alexandria. He spoke with power and was able to explain the holy writings well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>This man had been taught the way of the Lord. He was strong in spirit as he talked to people. What he taught them about the Lord was true. But he knew only about the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>He began to speak without fear in the meeting place. When Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him to their house. They explained the way of God so that he knew more about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>Apollos decided to go into Achaia. The Christian brothers wrote to the disciples there and asked them to receive him. When he reached Achaia, he helped very much those who believed. They believed because God was kind to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>He talked strongly with the Jews before the people. He proved to them from the holy writings that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul went over land and came to the city of Ephesus.  There he met some disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>Paul asked them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed? They said, No.  We have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>Paul asked them, How were you baptised? They said, We were baptised in Johns way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>Then Paul said, John baptised people when they stopped their wrong ways. He told people that they should believe on the one who would follow him. That one is Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>Paul put his hands on them. Then the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke in tongues of other lang-uages and spoke words from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>In all, there were about twelve men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>Paul went into the meeting place. For three months he talked without fear to the people there. He tried to talk so that people would obey God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>Some of them were fixed in their minds and would not believe. They said, The Christian way is not good They said this in front of all the people. So Paul left them and took the disciples away. He talked and answered the questions of the people every day in the school of a man named Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>This went on for two years, and all the people who lived in the province of Asia, both the Jews and the Greeks, heard the Lords word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>God did big works through Paul. Even some pieces of cloth he had touched were carried to sick people and they were healed. Also, people who had bad spirits in them were made free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>missing fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>Some Jews were there who travelled about from place to place. They had power over bad spirits like witch-doctors. They tried to make people free from bad spirits by using the name of the Lord Jesus. They said to the spirits, I tell you, in the name of Jesus, the one Paul talks about, come out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>There was a Jew named Sceva. He was a chief priest. He had seven sons who did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>But the bad spirit answered, I know Jesus and I know Paul. But who are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>And the man who had the bad spirit in him jumped on them. He beat them all because he was stronger than they were. Their bodies were bleeding and their clothes were torn.  They ran out of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>When all the Jews and the Greeks at Ephesus knew about this, they all feared. And they had great respect for the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>Many of the people who believed, told God all the bad things they used to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>Many had been witch-doctors. They brought their books and burned them in front of all the people. All the books together had cost about 50,000 silver coins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>Gods word spread with power. It reached more and more people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>After this, Paul decided he would go through Macedonia and Achaia and then to Jerusalem. After I have been there, he said, l must go to see the city of Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>He sent Timothy and Erastus, two of his helpers, into Macedonia. But he himself stayed in Asia Minor for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>About that time there was much trouble because of the Christian way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>A man named Demetrius made things from silver. He made little silver houses like the big house of the idol-god Diana. He and other men got much money from this work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>Demetrius called them all together. He said, Men, you know that we get our money from this work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>Now you see and hear how this man Paul has talked. He has turned away many people in Ephesus. Not only that, but he has turned away the hearts of many people in almost all of Asia Minor. He says that things made by mens hands are not really gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>This will spoil our work. Not only that, but people will not respect the house of the great idol goddess Diana any more. All the people in Asia and in the whole world worship her now. But they will despise her!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>When they heard this, the men were very angry and shouted, Great is Diana of Ephesus!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>All the people in the city were excited. They caught two men from Macedonia. Their names were Gaius and Aristarchus. They had travelled with Paul. Then they all rushed to the big meeting place with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>Paul wanted to go in and talk to the people, but the disciples would not let him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>Some of the leaders in Asia Minor liked Paul. They sent word to him and begged him not to go into the meeting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>Some of the people were shouting one thing and some another. They were all stirred up.  Most of the people did not know why they had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>The Jews pushed Alexander forward. Some of the people put him in front. He put up his hand and wanted to talk to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>But when they saw that he was a Jew, they all shouted together for two hours, Great is Diana of Ephesus!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>At last the city chief stopped the shouting. He said, Men of Ephesus, everyone knows that all the people of Ephesus take care of the house of the great Diana. And they take care of the stone which fell from the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>No person can say it is not true. So you should be quiet and not do anything foolish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>The men whom you have brought here have not taken anything from the house. They have not even said anything wrong about our goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>Now then, if Demetrius and the men who work with him have any complaint, let them take it to law. We have a court and we have judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>If you want anything more than that, it must be done in a meeting which has been called by law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>We may have trouble because of what has happened today. There is not one good reason for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.41'>When he had said this, he closed the meeting.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>When everything was quiet, Paul called the disciples. He talked to them so they would not be afraid. Then he said goodbye and left. He went to Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>He went through that country and talked to the people. He helped them to believe more strongly. Then he went to Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>He stayed there for three months. When he was ready to go to Syria by boat, he heard that the Jewish leaders were planning to catch him. So he said, I will go back through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>Some men went with him as far as Asia Minor. They were Sopater from Berea,  Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy, and also Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia Minor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>These went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>After the days of the Passover Feast, we left Philippi by boat. Five days later we met them in Troas. We stayed there for seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>On the first day of the week the disciples met together to break bread. Paul was ready to leave the next day. He talked a long time to the people at the meeting until long into the night. They were gathered in an upstairs room with many lights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>A young man named Eutychus sat in the window. He became very sleepy. When Paul kept talking so long, Eutychus was very deep in sleep and fell down from the third floor.  When the people picked him up he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>Paul went down stairs. He lay on him and put his arms around him. Do not fear, he said. He is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>Then Paul went upstairs again. He broke bread and ate some food. He talked for a long time, until daybreak. After that, he left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>The people took the young man. They were very glad because he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>We went by boat to the town of Assos. We were going to meet Paul there and take him on the boat. He told us to do that because he wanted to walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.14'>We met him at Assos, took him on the boat, and went to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>Then we went by boat the next day and came to Chios. The next day we passed the town of Samos. We reached Miletus on the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>Paul decided not to stop at Ephesus. He did not want to spend time in Asia Minor. He kept going as fast as he could, because he hoped to be at the feast in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>He sent a message from Miletus to Ephesus to call the leaders of the church to come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>When they came, he said, You know how I have lived all the time that I have been with you. I lived that way from the first day I came into Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>You know how I have served the Lord without being proud. And I have even cried for you. I served the Lord when I had troubles and when the leaders of the Jews tried to catch me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>I have not feared to tell you everything that would help you. I have taught you in meetings and in your homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>I have told both the Jews and the Greeks to stop doing wrong things. I have told them to believe in our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>And now I feel in my spirit that I must go to Jerusalem. I do not know what will happen to me there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.23'>But in every city the Holy Spirit tells me I will be put in prison. I will have much trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But none of these things trouble me. I do not try to save my life. All I want is to finish what I must do with joy. The work which the Lord Jesus gave me is to tell the good news that God is kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>I know that you all will never see me again. I have told you about Gods kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.26'>So I tell you today that if any one is lost, it is not my fault.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.27'>I have not feared to tell you all that God wants you to know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.28'>The Holy Spirit has made you leaders over his people. Watch yourselves. Like one who takes care of his sheep, so you must take care of the church people. They are the Lords people. He gave his blood for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.29'>I know this, that there are people as bad as wild animals. After I leave you, they will come to you. They will trouble Gods people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.30'>Also, some men will come from among you. They will teach things that are not true.  They want people to follow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.31'>So then, watch and remember this. For three years, through the night and in the day, I told every one of you to be careful. I even cried as I told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.32'>And now, my brothers, I give you to God. I leave with you his word which brings blessing. That word is able to make you strong. It will give you your share in the good things of God promised by him. He gives these good things to people who are pure and holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.33'>I did not want anyone to give me money or clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.34'>You yourselves know that I worked with my own hands to pay for the things that I and my friends needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>I have always shown you that you must work hard, as I have. You must help those who cannot work. By so doing you are remembering the words of the Lord Jesus. He said, "It makes you more happy to give something than to get something."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>When Paul had said this, he kneeled down and talked to God with them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>They all cried much. They put their arms around his neck and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.38'>They were sad most of all because he had said they would not see him again. And they went with him to the boat.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.21'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.1'>When we had said goodbye to them, we left them. We went straight across the water to the island of Cos. The next day we came to the island of Rhodes. Then we went to the city of Patara.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.2'>There we found a boat going to the country of Phoenicia, so we went there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.3'>When we saw the island of Cyprus, we went on the right side of it to Syria. We landed at Tyre because they unloaded the boat there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.4'>We found some Christians and stayed for seven days. The Holy Spirit spoke through them to Paul, Do not go on to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.5'>When the seven days had passed, we left and went on our way. All of the men, women,  and children went with us out of the city. There by the sea we kneeled down and talked to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.6'>We said goodbye to each other. Then we got on the boat and they went back to their homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.7'>From Tyre we went to Ptolemais. There we greeted the Christian brothers and stayed with them one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.8'>The next day we left and came to Caesarea. We went into the house of Philip. He was a man who went out telling the good news. He was one of the seven helpers in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.9'>He had four daughters who spoke words from God. They were not married.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.10'>While we were staying there for some days, a prophet named Agabus came from Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.11'>When he came to us, he took Pauls belt. He tied his own hands and feet with it. Then he said, The Holy Spirit has told me that in the same way the leaders of the Jews in Jerusalem will tie the man who owns this belt. They will give him over to the people who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.12'>When we heard this, both we and the people there talked to Paul and begged him not to go to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.13'>Then Paul answered, Why are you crying and making me sad like this? I am ready to be tied and also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>So when we saw that he would not change his mind, we stopped begging him. We said,  May the Lord do what he wants to be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>After that, we took our things and went to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>Some of the Christians from Caesarea went with us. One of them was Mnason, a man born in Cyprus. He was one of the first Christian believers. We stayed in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.17'>When we reached Jerusalem, the Christian brothers were glad to see us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>The next day Paul went with us to see James. All the church leaders were there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>First, Paul greeted them. Then he told them one by one the things God had done as he worked among the people who were not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>When they heard it, they praised the Lord. They said to Paul, Brother, there are many thousands of Jews who believe. They all say we must obey the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>They have heard that you teach all the Jews who live in other lands. They heard that you tell them not to obey Moses law: that they need not circumcise their children like the Jews do; and they can leave the Jewish ways of living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>What should we do about it? Many people will gather together because they will surely hear that you have come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>Now then, do the thing we tell you. We have four men who have made a promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>Take them with you. Make yourself clean with them, the way the law says to do. Pay the cost for having their hair cut. Then all the people will know that all the things they heard about you are not true. They will know that you live the way the law says you should live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>We sent a letter to those who are not Jews and have believed. Here is what we told them they must not do. They must not touch things that have been given to idols. They must not taste blood. They must not eat the meat of animals that were killed by choking. And they must not take part in any kind of wrong sexual behaviour between men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul took the men with him. The next day he made himself clean with them the way the law says to do. Then he went into the temple. He told the priests which day they would finish making themselves clean. On that day a sacrifice would be made for each one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>The seven days were almost over. The Jewish leaders from Asia Minor saw Paul in the temple. They got all the people there excited. They caught hold of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>They shouted, All you men of Israel, come and help us! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere not to respect our people. He says we need not obey the law or respect this temple. And what is more, he has brought Greek people into the temple. He has made this holy place unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>They said this because they had seen a man from Ephesus named Trophimus. He was in the city with Paul. And they thought that Paul had brought him into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>So all the people in the city were excited. They came running. They caught Paul and took him out of the temple by force. Then the doors were shut behind them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>They were trying to kill him. The officer in charge of the soldiers heard that all the people of Jerusalem were making trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>Right away he took some soldiers and officers with him and ran down to the people.  When the people saw them they stopped beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>Then the officer came up and took Paul. He had him tied with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>Some of the crowd shouted one thing and some of them shouted something else. The captain could not find out what was true. The people were shouting too much. So he told his soldiers to take Paul into their army house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>When Paul came to the steps, the soldiers carried him because the people were fighting to get him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>They were all following, shouting, Kill him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>Just as the soldiers were going to take Paul into their army house, he said to the officer,  May I tell you something? So, you speak the Greek language! said the officer. I thought you were the man from the country of Egypt who made trouble a while ago. I thought you were the one who led four thousand bad men into the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>Paul said, I am a Jew. I was born in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia. I belong to a great city.  Please let me talk to these people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>So the officer let him talk. Paul stood on the steps and put up his hand. Then all the people were very quiet. He talked to them in the Jews language.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>Paul said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen while I tell you my side of this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>When the people heard him speak in the Jews language, they were even more quiet.  Then Paul said, I am a Jew. I was born in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia. But I was raised here in this city. Gamaliel was my teacher. He taught me very well in the law of our fathers. I was trying hard to obey God, just as you all are today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>I troubled very much the people who believed this Way. I even killed them. I had men and women tied and put into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>The high priest and all the leaders know that this is true about me. They wrote letters for me to carry to the leaders of the Jews in the city of Damascus. I went to have the Christians there tied and brought to Jerusalem to be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>I was on my way and was near Damascus. It was about midday. All at once a very bright light from the sky shone all around me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>I fell to the ground and heard someone say to me, "Saul, Saul, why are you troubling me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>I said, "Who are you, Lord?" He answered, "I am Jesus of Nazareth. You are troubling me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>The men who were with me saw the light. They were afraid. But they did not hear the one who spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>Then I said, "Lord, what shall I do?" And the Lord said to me, "Get up and go to Damascus. There someone will tell you all you must do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>I could not see because the light was so bright. My friends led me by the hand to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>A man named Ananias was there. He obeyed the law of Moses, and all the Jews who lived there spoke well of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>He came to see me. He stood by my side and said to me, "Brother Saul, you can see again!" And right then I was able to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>He said, "The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will. He chose you to see the One who is right and to hear him speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>You will speak for him. You will tell all the people what you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>Now, why do you wait? Get up and be baptised. Wash away your wrong ways by calling on the name of the Lord!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>After I went back to Jerusalem, I was talking to God in the temple one day. Something like a dream came over me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>I heard the Lord say to me, "Leave Jerusalem quickly, right away. The people will not listen to the things you say about me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>And I said, "Lord, they know that I put in prison those who believed in you. I beat them in all the meeting houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>And I stood by and let people kill Stephen. He was one who talked for you. I looked after the clothes of the men who killed him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>But the Lord said to me, "Go! I will send you far away to the people who are not Jews."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>The people listened to Paul until he said that. Then they shouted, Kill him and get him off the earth. A man like that should not live!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>The people shouted. They waved their clothes about and threw dust in the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>The man in charge of the soldiers ordered Paul to be brought into the army house. He said that he should be beaten hard to make him tell why the people shouted so much at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>When they had tied him with ropes, Paul said to the captain who was standing by, Is it right for you to beat a man who belongs to Rome without judging his case?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>When the captain heard this, he told the commanding officer. He said, What are you going to do? This man is a Roman!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>Then the commanding officer came to Paul and said, Tell me, are you a Roman? Yes, I am, replied Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>Then the officer said, I paid much money to become a Roman. Paul said, I was born a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>Then the men who were going to beat him left him. The officer was afraid when he knew Paul was a Roman, because he had tied him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>The officer wanted to know the real reason why the Jewish leaders were angry with Paul. So the next day he had Paul untied. He called the chief priests and the leaders to hold a court meeting. Then he took Paul down and brought him in before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>Paul looked at the members of the court and said, My brothers, I have done what I thought God wanted me to do, right up to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>Ananias, the high priest, said to those who were standing near Paul, Hit his mouth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>Paul said, God will hit you down, you dirty wall painted white! You sit there to judge me by the law and you break the law by telling them to hit me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>The people who stood near Paul said, Do you say a wrong thing like that to Gods high priest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>Paul said, I did not know that he is a high priest. The holy writings say, "You shall not say anything wrong about a ruler of your people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>Paul knew that some of the men were from the Sadducee group and some of them were from the Pharisee group. So he called out in the court, My brothers, I am a Pharisee. My fathers were Pharisees. I am being judged because I believe that the dead will be raised to life again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>When he had said that, the Pharisees and the Sadducees began to talk back and forth.  The men in the court were divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>The Sadducees say the dead will not be raised again. They say there is no angel or spirit.  But the Pharisees believe in all these three things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>There was much shouting. Some of the clever men who were Pharisees got up. They said, We do not think this man has done wrong. Perhaps some angel or spirit really did speak to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>The people started fighting. The commanding officer was afraid they would tear Paul into pieces. So he told the soldiers to take Paul and bring him into the army house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>The next night the Lord stood beside Paul. He said, Be glad, Paul. You have told people about me in Jerusalem. You must also talk about me in Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>In the morning, some of the Jewish leaders planned together. They made a promise that they would not eat or drink until they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>There were more than forty Jews who made this secret plan together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>They came to the chief priests and leaders and said, We have made a promise for ourselves. We will not eat anything until we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>So now, you and the members of the court send word to the commanding officer. Tell him to bring Paul down to you. Make him think you want to find out more about Paul.  We will be ready to kill him before he gets there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>The son of Pauls sister heard about their secret plan. So he went into the army house and told Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>Paul called one of the officers and said to him, Take this young man to the commanding officer. He has something to tell him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>So the officer took him to the commanding officer. He said, Paul, the prisoner, called me. He asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>The officer took the young man by the arm. He went to one side so they could be alone.  He asked, What do you want to tell me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>The young man said, The leaders of the Jews have made a plan. They will ask you to bring Paul down to court tomorrow. They will say that they wish to find out more about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>But you must not do this. More than forty Jews are waiting for him. They have made a promise to themselves. They will not eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now and waiting for your agreement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>So the commanding officer sent the young man away. He said, You must not tell anyone that you have told me about these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>The commanding officer called two officers to him. He said, Get two hundred soldiers ready by nine oclock tonight to go to Caesarea. Send seventy men with them who will ride on horses and two hundred men who will carry spears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>Also have horses ready for Paul to ride. Take him safely to Felix, the ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>The officer wrote a letter to Felix like this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>Claudius Lysias sends greetings to you, great ruler Felix.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>This man was caught by the Jews. They were ready to kill him. But I came with my soldiers and took him away, because I found out that he is a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>I wanted to find out what complaint they had against him, so I brought him into their court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>I found out that their complaints were to do with their law. But he had not done anything wrong enough to die or to be put into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>When I heard that the Jewish leaders were planning to catch him, I sent him to you at once. I told those who are making complaints against him that they must bring the matter to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>So the soldiers took Paul as they had been told to do. They went with him that night as far as the town of Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>The next day the soldiers went back to the barracks. Only the men who were riding horses went with Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>When they reached Caesarea, they gave the letter to the ruler and brought Paul to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>He read the letter. Then he asked Paul what country he came from. He heard that Paul was from Cilicia. Then he said, I will hear all you have to say when the men who have made the complaint come here. He ordered Paul to be kept in the house which is called Herods palace.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>Five days later, Ananias the high priest came from Jerusalem. He brought with him some of the leaders and a lawyer named Tertullus. They told the ruler their complaint against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>Paul was called in. Tertullus began to bring the complaints. Great ruler Felix, he said,  we have peace because of what you have done. These people have a better life because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>We are always very glad for this everywhere we go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>I do not want to take much of your time. But please be kind and listen to a few words from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>We have found this man to be a real trouble-maker. He talks to the Jews all over the world and causes them to disobey the laws. He is the leading trouble-maker of the Nazarene group.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>He even tried to make the temple unclean. But we caught him and were going to judge him by our law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>But Lysias the commanding officer came. He took Paul away from us by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>He told those who have complaints against him to come to you. Ask him yourself and you will find out from him about all these complaints we have brought against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>The Jews agreed with what Tertullus the lawyer said. They said, Yes, yes, he is telling the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>The ruler made a sign for Paul to speak. So Paul said, I know that for many years you have judged matters for this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>So I am happy to speak for myself. Not more than twelve days ago I went to Jerusalem to worship. If you ask the people, you will find this out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>They did not find me quarrelling with anyone in the temple. I was not making trouble among the people in the meeting houses or in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>They cannot prove the things they have said against me here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>But I myself tell you this. I worship the God of my fathers in the Christian way. They say this is not the right way. I believe everything that the law teaches. I believe everything that the prophets have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>I believe that God will raise from death both the good people and the bad people. These people here believe the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>I always try to do what is right to God and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>I was away for a few years and I had come to Jerusalem to bring gifts to my people, and to give offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>While I was doing this, they found me in the temple. I had made myself clean the way the law says to do. I did not have many people around me. I was not making trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>Some Jews were there from Asia Minor. They should be here before you and talk against me if they have anything to say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>Or let these men here tell if they found anything wrong with me when I stood in their court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>I did this one thing. I shouted while I was standing among them, "I am being judged today because I believe that the dead will be raised again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>Felix sent them away because he knew many things about the Christian way. He said,  When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will know everything about this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>He said to the officer, Keep Paul in prison but let him have some freedom. Let his friends come to visit him and to do things for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>Some days after that, Felix came with his wife Drusilla. She was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to what Paul said about believing in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>Paul talked about what is right, about living the right way, and about the time when all people will be judged. Felix was very much afraid when he heard these things. He said to Paul, You may go now. When I have time, I will call you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>He hoped that Paul would give him money to free him. And so he often sent for Paul and talked with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>After two years, a man named Porcius Festus came to rule in Felixs place. Felix had wanted to please the Jewish leaders, so he left Paul in prison.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Three days after Festus came to the country, he went to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>Then the chief priests and the leaders of the Jews told him what they had against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>Please do something for us, they begged. Send for Paul to come to Jerusalem. They had made a secret plan to kill him on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>Festus said, Paul is being kept in prison in Caesarea. I myself am going there soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>Let the men among you who are able come with me. If Paul has done anything wrong,  then they can talk against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>Festus stayed only eight or ten days more among them. Then he went to Caesarea. The next day he sat on his chair in the court and had Paul brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>When Paul came in, the Jewish leaders who had come from Jerusalem stood around Paul. They talked much against him. But they could not prove that the things they said were true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>Paul spoke for himself. He said, I have done no wrong to the law, or to the temple, or against Caesar the ruler of the Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>Festus wanted to please the Jewish leaders, so he said to Paul, Will you go to Jerusalem and let me judge you there about these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>Paul said, I am standing in Caesars court. That is where I should be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews. You yourself know that well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>If I have done wrong things, or any wrong thing for which I should die, then I do not ask to live. But if the things these people say are not true, then no one has power to give me up to the leaders of the Jews. I ask to go to Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>So Festus talked the matter over with the court. Then he said to Paul, You have asked to go to Caesar. All right, you will go to Caesar!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>Some time after that, king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>They stayed for many days. Festus brought Pauls matter to the king. He said, Felix left a man in prison here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priest and leaders of the Jews came to me. They talked against him, and they asked me to punish him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>I told them that the Romans do not do it that way. They do not punish a man until he has met those who talk against him. Then he has a chance to speak for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>So they came here with me. I did not wait. The very next day I sat on my chair in the court and had the man brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>When they stood up, they did not say the wrong things against him that I thought they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>But instead, they had a quarrel with him about the things they believe in. The quarrel is about a man named Jesus who died. Paul said he is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>I did not know how to judge such things. So I asked if he would go to Jerusalem and be judged there about these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But Paul asked to wait and let Caesar judge his case. So I had him put in prison to be kept there until I can send him to Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>Agrippa said to Festus, I should like to hear the man myself. Festus said, Tomorrow you shall hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>So the next day Agrippa and Bernice came, making a big show of themselves. They went into the room to hear Paul talk. Officers and the leading men of the city also went in.  When Festus called for Paul, he was brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>Then Festus said, King Agrippa and all you men here with us, you see this man. All the Jewish leaders, both in Jerusalem and here, came together and talked about him. They shouted, "He must die!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>But I found out that he had not done anything wrong for which he should die. He himself asked to go to Caesar, so I decided to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>But I have no real complaint about him to write to my ruler. So I have brought this man before you all, and most of all before you, king Agrippa. When you have heard him, I hope I will have something to write about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>I think that it does not make sense to send a prisoner and not say what wrong he has done.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>Then Agrippa said to Paul, You may speak for yourself. So Paul put out his hand and began to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>King Agrippa, I am happy to speak for myself before you today. I will talk about all the things the leaders of the Jews have said against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>You know all the ways of the Jews. You know what they believe. So please take time to listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>All the Jews know the way I lived from the time I was young. From the beginning I lived with my own people at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>They have known me for a long time. They know, if they would tell it, that I lived like the Pharisee group. They obey the law better than any others who worship God the way we do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>I believe that God will keep the promise that he made to our fathers long ago. That is why I am standing here being judged today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>All the people of our twelve tribes serve God faithfully day and night. They do this because they believe they will receive what he has promised. Because I believe this, king Agrippa, the Jewish leaders are talking against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>Why is it so hard for any of you to believe that God should raise the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>I used to think that I must do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>I did this in Jerusalem. The chief priests gave me power. I put many of Gods people in prison. And when they were killed, I agreed to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>Often I punished them in all the meeting places. I tried to make them say wrong things about Christ. I was very, very angry. I even went to other cities to trouble them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>And so I was on my way to the city of Damascus. The chief priests had given me power and a letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>I was on the road at midday, king Agrippa, and I saw a bright light. It came from the sky and was brighter than the light of the sun. It shone all around me and the men who were travelling with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>We all fell to the ground. I heard someone say to me in the Jews language, "Saul, Saul,  why are you troubling me? You hurt yourself when you kick against the sticks which guide you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>I said, "Who are you, Lord?" And the Lord said, "I am Jesus, the one you are troubling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>But get up. Stand on your feet. Here is why I have shown myself to you. I have chosen you to work for me. I have chosen you to tell people what you saw when you saw me today. You are to tell them also about the other times when I will show myself to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>I will keep you safe from your own people, the Jews. And I will keep you safe from those who are not Jews. I am sending you to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>I send you to them to open their eyes. Then they will turn from darkness to light. You are to take them out of Satans power and turn them to God, to be forgiven of their wrong ways. Then they will be among those who are made clean and pure by believing in me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>So, king Agrippa, I obeyed what the one from heaven told me to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>I told the good news to the people of Damascus and Jerusalem. Then I told it all over Judea. I went to those who are not Jews. I told everyone that they must stop doing wrong things and turn to God. I told them they must show by the way they live that they have stopped doing wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>That is why the leaders of the Jews caught me in the temple and tried to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>God has always helped me up to today. I have stood and talked to both small people and great people. I have said nothing more than what the prophets and Moses said would happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>They said Christ must suffer. They said he would be the first person to rise from death.  He would be the first person to bring news of light to the Jews and those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>While Paul was saying these things Festus shouted, Paul, you are crazy! All your book learning is making you crazy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>Paul said, No, great ruler Festus, I am not crazy. But what I say is true. It makes good sense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>The king knows about these things. I am not afraid to talk to him about them. I am sure that not one of these things happened without his knowing about it. This did not happen in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>King Agrippa do you believe the prophets? I know you believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>Then Agrippa said to Paul, You are trying to make me a Christian right away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>Right away or later, said Paul. I wish that all who hear me today might be what I am.  That is, what I am without these chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>Then king Agrippa stood up. Festus and Bernice and those who were sitting there with them stood up also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>They left the room and talked the matter over. They said, This man is not doing anything wrong for which he ought to be in prison or die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>Agrippa said to Festus, We could let this man go free if he had not asked to go to Caesar.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>It was planned that we would go by boat to Italy. An officer named Julius was put in charge of Paul and some other prisoners. Julius was an army captain in the Augustan group.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>We got on a boat which was from the city of Adramyttium. This boat was going along the coast of Asia Minor. And so we went out to sea. A man named Aristarchus from the city of Thessalonica in Macedonia came with us also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>The next day we stopped at the city of Sidon. Julius was kind to Paul. He allowed him to go to see his friends so they could care for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>Then we started out to sea again. We went near the island of Cyprus, because the wind was blowing against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>We crossed the sea by the countries of Cilicia and Pamphylia. Then we reached the city of Myra in Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>There the officer found a boat from the city of Alexandria going to the country of Italy.  So he put us on that boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>We went slowly for many days. And after much trouble, we reached the city of Cnidus.  The wind was blowing hard against us. We could not go on. So we went around the south side of the island of Crete, past Cape Salmone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>We had trouble going along near the coast, but at last we came to a place called Fair Havens. This was near the town of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>It was now so late in the year that it was a bad time to go by boat. So Paul spoke to them about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>He said, Sirs, I see that if we go on by boat, we will have much trouble. Something bad will happen to the things on the boat and to the boat itself, and also to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>The officer did not listen to what Paul said. But he listened to the captain and the owner of the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>This place was not a good place for the boat to stay through the winter months of the year. So most of the men wanted to go on. They thought they might be able to reach Phoenicia and stay there for the winter. Phoenicia is a good place on the island of Crete.  Boats can stay there. The winds do not blow against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>When the south wind began to blow a little, they thought they had what they wanted. So they started off. They went along very close to the land of Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But soon a very strong north-east wind blew from Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>The wind blew against the boat and it could not go into the wind. So they let the boat go where the wind took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>We came close to a small island called Clauda. There we had a hard time to pull up the small boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>However, at last they got it up. Then they put ropes around the boat to make it strong.  They were also afraid they would get stuck in a bad place in the sand. So they took down the big sail cloth that was up to catch the wind. Then they let the boat go where the wind took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>The next day the storm was very bad. They threw out the things that were in the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>And the third day they threw off the things they used on the boat, with their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>For many days we could not see the sun or the stars. The bad storm kept on. We did not think that we would be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>The men of the boat had not eaten anything for a long time. Then Paul stood up and said,  Sirs, you should have listened to me and not left Crete. But you did leave. So you have had much trouble and have lost all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>Now I tell you to be glad. Not one of you will die. Only the boat will break and be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>I belong to God and worship him. Last night his angel stood before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>He said, "Paul, do not be afraid. You must stand before Caesar. And see, God has given you the lives of all these men who are travelling with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>So be glad, sirs. I believe God. It will be just the way he told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>However, we will have to go on an island.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>On the fourteenth night we were being blown across the Adrian Sea. About midnight the boatmen thought that we must be near some land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>So they tested how deep the water was there. They found that the line went down twenty arm lengths. A little later they tested and found that it was only fifteen arm lengths deep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>Then they were afraid that we would hit the rocks. There were four heavy iron hooks called anchors. They let them down into the water at the back end of the boat. Then they wished that morning would come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>The boatmen wanted to get off and leave the boat. They even put down the small boat into the water. They said they were going to put more anchors out from the front of the big boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>But Paul said to the officer and soldiers, If these men do not stay on the boat, you cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut the ropes holding the small boat and let the water carry it away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>When it was almost morning, Paul begged them all to eat. He said, Today is the fourteenth day that you have been watching and have not eaten anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>So now, I beg you, eat something. You need it to make you strong so you can save yourselves. Not one of you will lose even one hair from your head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>When he had said this, he stood in front of them all. He took some bread and thanked God for it. Then he broke it and began to eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>Then they all were glad and ate some food themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>In all, we were 276 people on the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>They ate all they wanted. Then they threw the grain into the water, so that the boat would not be so heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>In the morning they saw land. But they did not know what country it was. They saw a sandy place. So they talked it over and thought they would try to get the boat on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>They cut off the anchors and left them in the water. At the same time, they untied the wood that guided the boat. They put up the big sail to catch the wind and tried to get the boat onto that sandy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>But they came to a place where there was sand under the water. The boat stuck in it.  The front end stuck so badly that they could not make it go. The back end began to break up because the water beat it so hard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>The soldiers wanted to kill the prisoners so that none of them would swim to land and run away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>But the officer wanted to save Paul, so he stopped the soldiers. He told the people,  Those of you who can swim, jump into the water first and get to the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>Then the rest of you jump in and go on planks and other pieces of the boat. So in this way they all got to the land safely.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>When we were safe on land, we found that the island we were on was called Malta.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>The people there were very kind to us. They made a fire for us and took care of us. It was cold and raining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>Paul gathered some sticks of wood. He put them on the fire. A bad snake came out of the heat and hung onto his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>The people of Malta saw the snake hanging on his hand. Oh, they said to each other.  This man has no doubt killed someone. He did not die in the water, but it is not right for him to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>Paul shook the snake off into the fire. It did not hurt him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>The people thought surely he would swell up or would drop down dead at once. They waited a long time and saw that nothing bad happened to him. Then they said, We were wrong. He must be a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>The ruler of the island was a man named Publius. He owned some of the land there. He took us to his house for three days and was very kind to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>The father of Publius was sick with fever, and blood was coming from his body. Paul went to see him. He talked to God and put his hands on the man. He healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>After this, other sick people on the island came to Paul. And they too were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>They gave us many things. When we went away, they put on the boat for us the things that we would need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>A boat from the town of Alexandria was at the island all through the winter time. It was marked with a sign of the Twin Brothers. After we had been on the island for three months, we went on that boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>Then we went to the city of Syracuse and stayed for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>After that we turned the boat along the coast. We reached the town of Rhegium. When we had been there for a day, a south wind began to blow. On the second day we came to the city of Puteoli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>There we found some Christian brothers. They asked us to stay with them for seven days. Then we went to Rome. Some of the Christians at Rome had heard about us. They came to places called the Market Place of Appius and the Three Hotels. There they met us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God. It made him strong and glad to see these brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>When we came to Rome, Paul was allowed to stay in a house by himself with the soldier who guarded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>After three days, Paul called for the leaders of the Jews at Rome. When they had come,  he said to them, My brothers, I have done nothing against our people. I have obeyed the laws of our fathers. And yet I was made a prisoner at Jerusalem and was given over to the Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>When the Romans judged my case in court, they wanted to let me go free. They said there was no reason to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But the Jewish leaders did not agree to let me go free, so I had to ask to be brought before Caesar. I did not have anything to say against my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>Now, here is why I have asked to see you and to talk to you. I am a prisoner tied with chains because I believe the same promise the Jews believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>They said to him, The people of Judea have not written us any letter about you. When our brother Jews have come here, not one of them has told or said anything wrong about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we want to hear from you what you think. We know that people everywhere are talking against this Christian group.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>So they chose a certain day. On that day many of them came to the house where Paul was staying. He told them about Gods kingdom. He tried to make them understand about Jesus by the things that were written in the law of Moses and in the books of the prophets. He talked from morning until evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>Some of the people were ready to believe what he said, but others did not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>They did not agree among themselves. So they started to go away. But before they left,  Paul said one more thing. What the Holy Spirit said was right. He spoke to your fathers long ago through Isaiah, the prophet of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>He said, "Go to these people and say, You will hear but never understand. You will look but never see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>The hearts of these people have become hard. They do not hear with their ears. They have shut their eyes. They do not want to see with their eyes. They do not want to hear with their ears. They do not want to understand with their hearts. If they did, they would turn back to me and I would forgive them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>Paul said, Therefore know this. The message that God will save them has been sent to those who were not Jews. They will listen to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.29'>When Paul had said these words, the Jewish leaders went away. They were talking amongst themselves about these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>Paul stayed in Rome for two whole years in a house he paid money to live in. He was glad to see all who came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>He told them about Gods kingdom and taught them about the Lord Jesus Christ. He did this freely without fear. No one stopped him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>I am Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ. He called me to be an apostle and to tell Gods good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>Through his prophets long ago God promised this good news to people, in the holy writings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>The good news was about his Son. He is Jesus Christ our Lord. He was a man born in Davids family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>He came alive from death. That showed he was Gods Son. He had Gods power. Gods Holy Spirit did all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>This same Jesus Christ was kind to me. And he made me an apostle. I am sent in his name so that people in all nations will obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>You are some of them. You were called to belong to Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>I send greetings to all the Christians who live in the city of Rome. God loves you and has called you to be his people. May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you. In their kindness may they give you peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>People in all the world have heard that you believe. I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>God knows that I always talk to him about you. I worship him in my heart while I tell the good news about his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>I ask God that in some way now I may be able to visit you, if he wishes me to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>I want very much to see you. I want to give you some gift from the Holy Spirit to make you stronger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>I mean to say that we will both be helped. I will be helped because you believe, and you will be helped because I believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>My brothers, I want you to know that I have often planned to come to you. But something has stopped me until now. I planned to come so that I might see good things happen among you. I have done this in the other nations which are not Jewish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>This is something I must do for the Greek people and for all other people. I must do it for people who are wise and for people who are not wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>That is why I want so much to tell the good news to you people in the city of Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>I am not ashamed of the good news of Jesus Christ. The good news is the power God uses to save every one who believes. The good news was for the Jews first, but also for those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>The good news shows how God puts a person right. God puts a person right when that person believes in his Son and keeps on believing. The holy writings say, A person who is put right because he believes, will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>God is angry. He has shown it from heaven. He is angry because of all the bad and wrong things people do. These people hold back Gods truth by the wrong things they do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>They know about God. God himself has shown them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>People cannot see that God has power which lasts for ever. They cannot see that he is really God. But ever since he made the world, he has clearly shown this by the things he made. So they cannot say, I did not know about God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>Even though they knew he was God, they did not worship him as God. They did not thank him. Their thoughts were no good. Their foolish minds became dark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>They said they were wise people, but they were foolish people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>They did not worship God who cannot die. But they worshipped things made to look like a man who does die. They worshipped things made to look like birds and animals and snakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>So God left them to do the things their hearts wanted to do. They did the things that are not right to do with their bodies. They did not respect their own bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>They would not believe what was true about God. They believed a lie. They worshipped and worked for something that was made by God. They did not worship God-God who made all things. He is the one to worship for ever. Amen. May it be so!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>That is why God left them to do the wrong things they wanted to do. Their women left the right way for women and did things that are wrong for women to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>Their men also left the right way with women. They wanted to have sex with one another. They did wrong things with other men. Their own bodies were punished because of the wrong things they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>They did not want to know God. So he left them to their wrong thoughts and to do things that are not right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>They were very bad. They did every kind of wrong thing. They were greedy. They hated people. They were very jealous. They killed many people. They fought. They fooled people. They told lies about people. They carried stories from one person to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>They said wrong things about people. They hated God. They did not respect people.  They were proud. They talked big. They even thought of new wrong things to do. They did not obey their parents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>.They were foolish. They did not do what they said they would do. They did not love people. They were not kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>They know that God says that people who do such things should die. Even so, they not only do them, but they praise other people who do them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Do you judge another people? You your-selves have done wrong things. So when you judge others, you judge yourselves, because you do the same things. You judge them and yet you do the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>We know that God judges people who do such things. And he judges them by what is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>Man, you judge people who do such things and yet you do them yourself. Do you think that God will not judge you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or do you not respect him for being kind, very patient, and for waiting a long time? Do you not know that God is kind, and he wants to lead you away from doing wrong things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But your hearts are hard. You will not stop. That is why God will be angry with you. He will be angry on the day when people will see that he judges in the right way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>He will pay every man for what he has done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>He will give life for ever to people who keep on doing good. These people want to have glory and honour from God, and to live for ever.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>Every one who does what is wrong will have much trouble and a hard time. This will happen to the Jews first, then to those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>And every one who does what is good, will be made great. He will have honour and peace. This will happen to the Jews first and then to those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>God does not love some people more than others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>All those who do not know the law &lt;FI&gt;of God given to Moses&lt;Fi&gt; and did what was wrong,  will die. But they will not be judged by the law. All those who know the law and did what was wrong will be judged by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>(God does not say people are good because they have heard the law. But people who obey the law will be called good people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>Some people do not have the law. But they do what the law says because their own hearts tell them to. They have a law of their own, even though they do not know the law.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>This will be on the day when God judges the things men have kept secret. Jesus Christ will be the judge. That is part of the good news I tell people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>The holy writings say, People who are not Jews say wrong things about the name of God. They do it because of what you Jews do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>Circumcision of the body is a good thing if you obey the law. But if you break the law,  you are like a man who has not been circumcised with this mark of the Jew.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>It is much better in every way. First, Gods law was given to the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>But some Jews did not keep his law. Does that mean that God cannot be trusted?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>No, it does not mean that. God must be true, even if every man is not true. The holy writings say this about God: People will see that you are right in what you say. You will be without fault when you are judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>When we do wrong things, we show that God is right. What shall we say about that?  Does God do wrong when he punishes us? (I speak the way people would think about it.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>No, he does not. If he did wrong, how could he judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>Maybe I say what is not true. And that makes people praise God more because he is true.  Then why does God still judge me and say I have done wrong?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>Some people say wrong things about us. They say that we say, Let us do wrong things so that good things will happen. People who say such things should be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>So what shall we say? Are we Jews any better than other people? No, we are not! I have already shown that all men, both Jews and people who are not Jews have done wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>The holy writings say, No one is good. No, not one person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>No one is wise. No one wants to know God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>They all have turned away from the straight road. Together they have gone the wrong way. No one does good, not even one person!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>Their mouth is like an open grave. They have used their tongues to fool people. The poison of bad snakes is under their lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>Their mouths are full of cursing and saying bad words to people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>Their feet run quickly to kill people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>Death and trouble are on the ways they go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>They do not know the way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>They do not fear God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>We know that everything the law says, it says to the people who have the law. Then no one can say a word for themselves. All the people in the world will be brought to God to be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>No one will be put right with God because he has tried to obey the law. The law only makes people know what they have done wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>So now God has shown how people can be put right with him without the law. The law and the prophets said he would do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>God puts people right with himself when they believe in Jesus Christ. He does this for all who believe. They are all alike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>All have done wrong and all are far from being as good as God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>But God is kind and makes them right with himself. It is a gift. He does it because Christ Jesus paid the price to set them free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>God gave him as a sacrifice. When people believe in him, his blood pays for the wrong things they have done. This shows that God is good and right. He was right when he forgave the wrong things that people did long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>God also shows that he is right now. He does this when he makes right any person who believes in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Then what have we to be proud of? Nothing at all. Why not? Does God put us right with himself because of anything we have done? No. He does it because we believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>We know that if a person believes in Christ, God makes him right again. It is not because that person has obeyed the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of other people also? Yes, he is.  There is only one God of all peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>He will put right people who have been circumcised &lt;FI&gt;the Jews&lt;Fi&gt; because they believe. And he will also put right people who are not circumcised when they believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>When we believe, does that make the law no good to us? No. That is not so. When we believe, we show that the law is right.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>So what shall we say about Abraham? He is the father of our family on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>If Abraham was put right with God, because of what he did, he has something to be proud of. But he has nothing to be proud of when he stands before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>What do the holy writings say? It says, Abraham believed God. And God said that he was a good man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>When a person works, his pay is not a gift to him. His pay belongs to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>But no person can work to put himself right with God. It is God alone who makes a bad person right. The one who believes in him-even a bad person is put right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>David also says that God blesses a man. God calls him a good man but not because he has kept the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>David said, God blesses people who have been forgiven the wrong things they have done. God covers over the wrong things they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>The Lord blesses people when he forgets the wrong things they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Does God bless only people who have been circumcised? Or does he also bless those who are not? We say, because Abraham believed God, God called him a good man. His faith made him right with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>When did God say that? Was it when Abraham was circumcised? Or was it before? It was not when he was circumcised: it was before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>Abraham was circumcised as a sign. It was a sign that he was a good man, because he believed when he was not yet circumcised. That makes him the father of all people who believe, even those who are not circumcised. God says they are good people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>That makes him also the father of those who are circumcised. I mean people who are circumcised and do as our father Abraham did. Even when he was not circumcised, he believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>God promised Abraham and his family that the world would belong to them. God did not make the promise because Abraham obeyed the law. But he made the promise because Abraham believed him and was put right with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>If the world will belong to people who obey the law, it is of no use to believe God. And the promise is no good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>Because of the law, God is angry. Where there is no law, no one breaks the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>That is why people must believe. Because God is kind, he makes the promise sure for all of Abrahams children. The promise is for those who have the law and also for those who believe as Abraham did. He is the father of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>the holy writings say, I have made you the father of many nations. Abraham was made the father of many nations by God. He believed God. He believed that God could make dead people live. He believed God when he said that things were true even though they had not happened yet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>Abraham believed and hoped, though there was nothing to give him hope. He believed that he would become the father of many nations. God had told him this would happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>He did not stop believing when he thought about his own body. It was almost dead. He was about one hundred years old. He did not stop believing when he thought about Sarah, even though she had never given birth to any children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>He did not stop believing Gods promise. He believed God very much. He did not praise God for his own faith, but for Gods promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>He was sure that God was able to do what he had promised to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>He was put right with God because he believed the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>The holy writings do not say that for Abraham only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>They say it for us too. God will say we are put right if we believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>He was killed because we did wrong things. He was raised from death in order that we might be made right with God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>We are made good people and put right with God when we believe in Jesus Christ. So now we have peace with God because of what our Lord Jesus Christ did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>Because we believe, Christ has brought us to the place where God can do us good. We are in that place now. We are very happy because we have the hope that we shall see Gods greatness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only is that true, but we are very happy in our troubles, because we know that trouble makes us stronger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>When we are strong to take trouble, we prove that we believe. When we prove that we believe, we have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>We will not be disappointed by this hope. God has given us the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit has put Gods love in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>We could not help ourselves. So at the right time, Christ died to save us bad people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>Almost no one would die to save even a good man. But perhaps someone would die to save a very good man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>God shows his love for us in this way: Christ died to save us while we were bad people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>The blood of Christ has now put us right with God. So even more, he will save us from Gods strong anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>When we were enemies, the death of his Son brought us back to God. Now that we are made right with God, it is the life of Jesus that will save us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>Not only is that true, but it is through our Lord Jesus Christ that we can enjoy God. This is for all who have been brought back to God by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>One man &lt;FI&gt;Adam&lt;Fi&gt; did a wrong thing. And the wrong thing he did made him die. So all men die because all have done wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>People in the world were not right with God before he gave the law. But wrong things are not punished when there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Yet death ruled over people from Adams time to Moses time. It even ruled over the people who were not as wrong as Adam. Adam was like a person who would come later.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But the free gift is not like the wrong thing. Many people died because one man did a wrong thing. This is sure. God was very kind and he gave a free gift. This gift was given to many people because one man, Jesus Christ, did a very kind thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>The free gift is not like the wrong thing one man did. Because of that one man people were judged. And they were punished. Because many people did wrong things, God gave his free gift and many people were made right with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>One man did a wrong thing. And so death ruled over people because of that one man.  God has been kind to people and given them his free gift. That gift is to make people right with God. People who take that gift will live and rule because of one man, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>One man did a wrong thing. And so all people were punished through him. But Christ did the right thing. And so all people can have the free gift of life through being put right with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>One man did not obey. And so many people were bad people. One man obeyed. And so many people will be made right with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>When the law came, it showed how wrong people really were. But when people were really bad, God was even more kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>The wrong things people did ruled over them, and they died. Now God has been very kind. He has made people right with him. So now Gods blessing will rule over them, and they will live for ever. Jesus Christ our Lord has done this for them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What shall we say then? Shall we keep on doing wrong things so that God will be more kind to us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>No, surely not! We died to our wrong ways and no longer live in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>All of us have been baptised in water. This means we are joined to Christ Jesus. We were baptised into his death. Do you know that?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>We were buried when he was buried because we were baptised into his death. Christ was raised from death by the wonderful power of the Father. So we also must live a new life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>Have we shared with Christ and died as he died? Then we shall share with him by rising from death as he arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>We know this is true. The old person we used to be was nailed to the cross with him, so that our bodies which do wrong things would die. Then we will no longer be like slaves to the wrong things we used to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>Anyone who has died no longer does wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>If we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>We know that Christ was raised from death and will not die again. Death has no power over him any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>He died. And he died once for all time, so that people would stop their wrong ways. But now he lives. And he lives for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>So you also must think you are dead, and stop your wrong ways. And you must think you are living for God along with Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Do not let wrong things rule over your bodies that are going to die. Do not do the things your bodies want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>Do not use your bodies to do wrong things. But give yourselves to God like men who have been raised from death to life. Give your bodies to God and use them to do good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>Wrong ways will not be your masters. The law does not rule over you now, but Gods loving kindness rules over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? The law does not rule over us now. Gods loving kindness rules over us. So,  shall we do wrong things? No, never!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>If you give yourselves to be slaves and obey your master, you are not free. You are his slaves. Do you not know this: you may be slaves to wrong things? But you will not live for ever. Or you may be slaves to obey God. Then you will be made good people and live with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>You were at one time slaves to wrong things. But I praise God that you obeyed what your teachers taught you. And you obeyed because you wanted to obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>You were made free from doing wrong things. You were made slaves to good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>I speak the way people would think about such things, because your minds are weak. At one time you gave your bodies to be slaves to your unclean ways, and to do more and more wrong things. So now give your bodies to be slaves to doing what is right, and to being good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>When you were slaves to wrong things, you were free from doing good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>You are now ashamed of those things. What good did they do you? For the end of those things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But now you have been made free from wrong ways and you have been made Gods slaves. You are made good and you will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.23'>The reward that wrong ways give is to die. But the gift which God gives is to live for ever.  Christ Jesus our Lord has done this for us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>My brothers, I am saying this to you people who know the law. Do you not know that the law is master over a person only while he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>A married woman belongs to her husband by law as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free from the law that made her belong to her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>So if she belongs to another man while her husband is living, she commits adultery. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law. Then if she belongs to another man, she does not commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>In the same way my brothers, you died when Christ died. And you are free from the law.  Now you belong to another person. You belong to the one who has been raised from death. Because of that, we are able to do what God wants us to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>One time we lived in the way our bodies wanted to live. The law made us think about doing wrong things. And we did things that made us die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now we have been made free from the law. We died, and so we are no longer slaves to the one who was our master. Now we are slaves to God in our new life. This new life is ruled by the Spirit. We do not work for the old written law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>So what shall we say? Shall we say that the law is bad? No! I would not have known what is wrong if there had been no law. The law says, Do not want to take other peoples things. That is how I know it is wrong to want another persons things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>My wrong ways used the law to make me want all kinds of things. When there is no law,  the thing within me that wants to do wrong is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>Once I had no law, and I lived. But when the law came, that which wanted to do wrong things came to life, and I died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>The same law which was meant to make a person live, made me die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>My wrong ways used the law to fool me and kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>So the law is holy. And what the law says is holy and right and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>So did that good thing make me die? No. The wrong things I did made me die, because that good thing showed they were wrong. And the law shows that the wrong things are very, very bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>We know that the law came from the Holy Spirit. But I am a weak man. I have been sold like a slave to do wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>I do not know why I do the things I do. I do not do what I want to do. But I do the things I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>So now it is no longer I who do it, but my wrong ways in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>I know that no good thing lives in me. I mean, no good thing lives in my body. I want to do what is good, but I cannot do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>I do not do the good thing I want to do, but I do the wrong thing that I do not want to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>If I do the thing I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but the wrong thing in me that does it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>So there is a law I find that it is at work in me. When I want to do what is right, I can only do what is wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>In my own mind I am glad to obey the law of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>But I see that in my body there is another law fighting against the law in my mind. And that makes me like a prisoner to the law of wrong things in my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>I am a very sad man. Who will save me from this body that will make me die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>Thank God for Jesus Christ our Lord who will do it! So this is the way it is. In my mind I am a slave to do the law of God, but in my body I am a slave to do the law of wrong things.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>So now those who belong to Christ Jesus will not be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>The Spirit gives life in Christ Jesus. And the law of the Spirit has set me free from the law of wrong things, and the law of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>God has done what the law could not do. The things people did made the law weak. God sent his own Son in a body of man. His body was like the bodies which others use to do wrong things. He sent him because people have done wrong things. And he judged the wrong things people have done in their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>He did this so that we might be good people as the law said we should be. We are good people if we live the way the Spirit wants us to live, not the way our bodies want to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>Some people live the way their bodies want to live. They think only about the things their bodies want to do. Other people live the way the Spirit wants them to live. They think about the things the Spirit wants them to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>If you keep your mind on the things your bodies want to do, you will die. But if you keep your mind on the things the Spirit wants, you will live and have peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>People who think about the things of this life are Gods enemies. They do not obey Gods law. They cannot obey it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>People who do what their bodies want cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>Does Gods Spirit live in you? If he does, then you are not living the way the body wants,  but you are living the way the Spirit wants. If anyone does not have Christs Spirit, he does not belong to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>But if Christ is in you, your bodies are dead because of the wrong things you have done.  But your spirits live because you have been made right with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>God raised Christ Jesus from death. Does Gods Spirit live in you? Then God will also give life to your bodies which die. He does this through his Spirit who lives in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>So, my brothers, we must not live the way our bodies want us to live. We must not be ruled by our wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>If you live the way your bodies wants to live, you will die. But if, by the help of the Spirit,  you stop doing the wrong things your bodies want to do, you will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>All who do what Gods Spirit leads them to do are Gods sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>The Holy Spirit you have received does not make you a slave again so that you are afraid.  But the Spirit you have received makes you sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>So we say, Father! Father! The Spirit himself also, along with our own spirits, tells us that we are Gods children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>If we are his children, God will give us the good things that children receive. He will give us these blessings along with Christ. He will give it to us if we suffer with Christ. If we suffer with Christ, we will also be made great with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>I think that the troubles we have in this life are nothing when we think of the great things that we shall have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>The whole world is waiting for the time when the sons of God will be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>The world was spoiled. It did not want to be spoiled, but God allowed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>And it hoped to be free like Gods children when they are made great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>We know that the whole world has been crying. It has had much pain until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not the world only, but we ourselves also cry out. We have the first blessing God gives of his Spirit. But we cry out in our hearts. We are waiting for God to finish making us his sons. Then our bodies will be set free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>That is what we hoped for when we were saved. When the thing hoped for is seen, there is no more hoping. When a person sees a thing, how can he hope for it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for something we do not see, we keep on waiting for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>Also the Spirit helps us because we are weak. We do not know how we should talk to God. But the Spirit himself talks to God for us, while we cry and cannot say any words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>God looks to see what is in peoples hearts. And he knows what the Spirit is going to do.  The Spirit talks to God for Gods people. And he asks for them what God wants them to have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>We know that God works out everything for the good of those who love him. They are the people who are part of his plan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.29'>He knew all along that he would choose them. He chose them to be made like his Son.  Then his Son would be the first one of many brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.30'>He chose them and he also called them. He called them to himself as if they had never been bad people. He made them right with himself and he also made them great in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>So what shall we say about this? If God is on our side, who can be against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>He did not keep his own Son, but gave him up for us all. Because he has given him to us,  will he not also give us all other things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who will say anything against Gods chosen people? For it is God himself who says they have been put right with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who will say they are not right? Jesus Christ died. Yes, he was raised from death. He is at the right side of God. And he talks to God for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who can take us away from Christs love? We may have trouble. We may have hard times. People may make us suffer because we believe. We may have no food to eat and no clothes to wear. We may be in danger. We may be killed with big knives. Can any of these things take us away from Christs love?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>The holy writings say, For your sake we are killed all day. We are like sheep ready to be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>But Christ loved us. He has helped us to win great victory in all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>I know this. Death, life, angels, rulers, things happening now, things that will happen,  high things, low things; nothing else in all the world can come between us and Gods love in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.1'>What I say is true and Christ knows it is. I do not tell a lie. My heart tells me it is true.  And the Holy Spirit knows this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.2'>I am very sad. I am always troubled. 3I could almost wish I were taken away from Christ for the sake of my brothers, the people of my own nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.3'>They are Jews. God gave them the right to be his sons. He showed them how great he is.  He made agreements with them. He gave them the law. He told them how to worship him. He gave them the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.4'>The great men were their fathers. Christ was born a Jew. He is God over all. Praise him for ever! Yes, he is!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.5'>God will do what he said he would do. Not all who are Jews belong to the real Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.6'>Not all the people in Abrahams family are his children. But the holy writings say, It is Isaacs family who will be called your family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.7'>This means that not all who were born in Abrahams family are Gods children. God promised Abraham a son &lt;FI&gt;Isaac&lt;Fi&gt; . His children &lt;FI&gt;the Jews&lt;Fi&gt; are the ones that God called Abrahams true family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.8'>For this is what God promised, About this time next year I will come and Sarah shall have a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.9'>And that is not all. Rebecca also had children. Their father was Isaac, our father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.10'>, fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.11'>When the children were not yet born, they had done nothing good or bad. God chooses the people he wants. He does not choose people because of what they have done. He chooses people who will answer his call. So he said to Rebecca, The older one will be a slave of the younger one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.12'>The holy writings also say, I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.13'>So what shall we say? Does God do what is not right? No, never!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.14'>He says to Moses, I will be kind to a person if I choose to be kind to him. I will share in the suffering of others if I choose to be sorry for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.15'>God is not kind to a person because the person wants God to be kind to him. God is not kind to him because the person runs to him to ask him for help. God is kind because he chooses to be kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.16'>In the holy writings it says to Pharaoh, That is why I made you live. I wanted to show my power through you. I wanted people to know about me all over the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.17'>So God is kind to any person if he wants to be kind to him. And God makes a mans heart hard if he wants to do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.18'>So you will ask me, Why does God still blame us? Who can fight against what God has planned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.19'>But you are only a man. Will you tell God what to do? Can the pot say to the man who made it, Why did you make me like this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.20'>The person who makes pots has power over the mud. He can make two different pots out of one pile of mud. One pot will be fine and another will not be fine. Can the potter not make them so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.21'>God has a right to be very angry if he wants to be. He has the right to show his power.  God was very angry with some people who deserved to die. And yet he waited a long time before he did anything to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.22'>He did it to show how very great he is. He was kind to some people. He planned for them to be made great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.23'>That means he also called us. He called not only those who are Jews, but also those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.24'>In the book written long ago by the prophet Hosea, God says They were not my people.  But I will call them "my people". I did not love her, but I will call her "the one I love."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.25'>And in the very place where it was said to them, "You are not my people," they will be called "sons of the living God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.26'>Isaiah the prophet of God said long ago about Israel, Even if the people of Israel are as many as the sand by the sea, only some of them will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.27'>The Lord will do what he said he will do on the earth. He will do it all and do it soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.28'>And Isaiah also said, The Lord who has power, left some of our children. If he had not,  we would have been like Sodom. We would have been destroyed like Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.29'>So what shall we say? The people who are not Jews have been put right with God. They did nothing to make themselves right with God. But they were put right because they believed God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.30'>But the Jews tried to obey the law that could make them good people. But they did not obey it all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.31'>Why was that? They did not trust in God. They only trusted in doing the things of the law. They therefore hit their feet on the stone on which men hit their feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.32'>That is what the holy writings say, I put in Zion a stone on which people will hit their feet. It is a rock that will make them fall down. Anyone who believes in him will not be ashamed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.10.1'>My brothers, with all my heart I want the Jews to be saved. And I ask God to save them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.2'>I can say this about them, they want very much to obey God. But they do not know the right way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.3'>They did not know the way God makes people right with him. They tried to make themselves good people. So they did not obey Gods way to become right with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.4'>Christ has made an end to the law as a way of getting right with God. Everyone who believes in him is put right with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.5'>Moses wrote this: A man who obeys the law will live by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.6'>But the holy writings also speak about those who are put right by believing: Do not say in your heart, "Who will go up into heaven?" (That means, Who will go up to heaven to bring Christ down?)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.7'>Do not say, "Who will go down into the hole that has no bottom?" (That means, Who will go down to bring Christ up from the dead people?)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.8'>But what do the holy writings say? They say, The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart. That means, the word to believe which we tell people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.9'>If you say with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and if you believe in your heart that God has raised Christ from death, you will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.10'>A person believes with his heart, and he is made right with God. He speaks with his mouth and so is saved from his wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.11'>The holy writings say, Anyone who believes in him will not be let down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.12'>The Jews and other people are alike. The same Lord is Lord of all people. He richly blesses all who call out to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.13'>The holy writings say, Everyone who calls out to the Lord will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.14'>But how can people call someone if they have not believed in him? And how can they believe in him if they have not heard about him? And how can they hear about him if no one tells them about him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.15'>And how can people tell about him if no one sends them? The holy writings say, How good are the feet of those who bring the good news of peace and happiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.16'>But they have not all obeyed the good news. It is as Isaiah said it would be, Lord, who has believed what we have told them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.17'>So people believe because they hear. They hear because people tell them about Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.18'>But I ask, have they not heard? Yes, they have. The holy writings say, Their voice has gone out all over the earth. And their words have gone out all over the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.19'>But I ask, did not the Jews know? First the book of Moses says, I will make you jealous through people who are not a nation like the Jews. I will make you angry through people who do not even know or understand these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.20'>But the book of Isaiah says even stronger words. The people who did not look for me have found me. I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.21'>But he says about the Jews, All day I held out my hands to a people who did not obey me, who said wrong things against me.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.1'>So I ask, has God left his people? No, he has not! I myself am a Jew. I was born in Abrahams family. I belong to the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.2'>God has not left his people whom he knew from the first. Do you not know what the holy writings say about the prophet Elijah? He talked to God against the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.3'>He said, Lord, they have killed your prophets. They have pulled down your holy places.  I am the only one that is left, and they are trying to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.4'>But what did God answer him? He said, I have seven thousand men who have not kneeled down to the idol god Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.5'>So now some are left because God was kind to them, and chose them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.6'>But if it was a gift because he was kind to them, then it was no longer because of the things they did. Or else a gift would no longer be a gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.7'>So what does that mean? The Jews did not get what they tried to get. Only the people God chose got it. The hearts of the rest of the people became hard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.8'>The holy writings say, God made them dull with sleep. He gave them eyes that could not see, and ears that could not hear. They have been like that until today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.9'>And David said long ago, May the table where they eat be like a net and like a trap. May it make them fall down. May it punish them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.10'>Make their eyes become blind so that they cannot see. Make their backs bent all the time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.11'>So I ask, Have their feet been caught so that they have really fallen down? No. But because they began to fall, the people who are not Jews were told how to be saved. That would make the Jews jealous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.12'>The people who are not Jews have been richly blessed because the Jews failed. So it will be even better for them when the Jews no longer fail God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.13'>Now I say this to you who are not Jews. I am an apostle to those who are not Jews, so I think highly of the work I have been sent to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.14'>I want the people of my own nation, the Jews, to be jealous. Then I may be able to save some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.15'>God turned away from the Jews in order to bring the world back to himself. Then if that is true, when he takes the Jews back to himself, will not that be like making dead people live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.16'>If the first piece of bread is holy, so is all the rest which came from the same bread mix.  If the root of a tree is holy, the branches are holy also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.17'>Maybe some of the trees branches were broken off. And you, a branch from a wild olive tree, were made to grow on the tree among the branches. You then have the good water that comes from the root of the olive tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.18'>But do not think that you are better than the trees own branches. If you do, remember it is not you that holds the root in place. But it is the root that holds you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.19'>Then you will say, The branches were broken off so that I might be joined to the tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>That is true. They were broken off because they did not believe. And you have your place only because you believe. So do not be proud, but fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>If God punished the trees own branches, he will punish you also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>See how kind God is. And see how hard he is. He is hard on those who have fallen. But God is kind to you if you go on following in his ways. If you do not, you also will be broken off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>God will also put back the other branches if they believe. God is able to put the Jews back where they belong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>You were cut off from a wild olive tree. And you were put on a good olive tree. That is not the way trees grow. But it can be done. And so, even more, the Jewish branches will be put back on their own olive tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>My brothers, I want you to know something that has been a secret. Then you will not be proud of yourselves. The secret is this. Some Jews will have hard hearts until the right number of other people have come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>Then all the Jews will be saved. The holy writings say, Someone will come from Zion to save people. He will take away the wrong ways of our father Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>This will be my agreement with them when I take away the wrong things they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>The Jews make themselves enemies of God because they do not want the good news of Jesus Christ. That helps you since the good news has then come to you. But God still loves the Jews because of the promise he made to their fathers long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>God does not change his gifts or his call to people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>At one time you did not obey God. But now he has been kind to you because the Jews did not obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>So now, they also have not obeyed him. But he will also be kind to them because he was kind to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>God allowed people to disobey him. He did it so that he might be kind and forgive all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>God is very kind. He is very wise. He knows much. No one can understand why he judges the way he does. No one can find out why he does the things he does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.34'>The holy writings say, Who has known what the Lord thinks? Who has ever told him what to do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.35'>Who has given a gift to God first, so that God would give him something also?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.13.14'>But you must take the Lord Jesus Christ into your hearts. And do not plan to do the wrong things your bodies want to do.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.1'>Be ready to take a person into the church even if he does not know and believe all you believe. Do not judge what he thinks about things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.2'>One person believes he may eat anything. Another person, who does not believe that,  eats only things that grow in the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>The one who eats anything must not despise the one who does not eat everything. And the one who does not eat must not judge the person who does. God has accepted him as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Why do you judge another persons servant? He stands or he falls before his own master.  But he will stand because the Lord can give him power to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>One man thinks, This day is better than that day. But another man thinks, All days are alike. Every man should be sure in his own mind what he believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>One man honours the day to honour the Lord; another man does not honour the day to honour the Lord. The person who eats everything, eats it because he honours the Lord.  And he thanks God. And the person who will not eat every kind of food also does so to honour the Lord. And he still gives thanks to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>Not one of us lives for himself. And not one of us dies for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>If we live, we live for the Lord. And if we die, we die for the Lord. So then, if we live or if we die we belong to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.9'>Christ wanted to be Lord, both of dead people and of living people. That is why he died and lived again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>Why do you judge your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? We shall all stand before God to be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.11'>The holy writings say, The Lord says, "As sure as I live, every knee will bow to me.  Every tongue will praise God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.12'>So each of us will tell God about what he has done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>So we must not judge each other any longer. But it is better for us to judge this. Never put anything in a brothers way that will hurt him or that will make him fall down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>As a Christian, I know and believe that nothing in itself is not right to eat. But it is not right for anyone to eat who thinks it is not right to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>Does what you eat trouble your brother? If it does, you are no longer living in love. Do not destroy the faith of someone because of what you eat. Christ died for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>What is good for you must not be something that other people say is wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>The kingdom of God is not about what a person eats and drinks. But it is about living in a way which is right with God. It is peace. It is joy because a person has the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>A person who does the work of Christ in this way pleases God. And people like him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>But we must do the things that make peace and that help each other to do better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>Do not spoil what God has done because you want some food. Everything is right. But it is wrong for anyone to eat anything if that will make his brother fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>The right thing is to eat no meat, and drink no wine, and not do anything that makes your brother fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>Keep to yourself and God what you believe about these things. God blesses a man who does not feel he has done wrong when he did what he thought was right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.23'>But a man who is not sure that he should eat something, does wrong if he eats it. That is because he does not believe the thing he is doing is right to do. And it is wrong to do what you do not believe is right.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.15.1'>We who are strong must help those who are not strong. We must not do what pleases us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.2'>But each of us must please his neighbour. He must do what is good for him and what will help him do better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.3'>Christ did not please himself. But the holy writings say, I took upon myself the wrong things that people said against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.4'>Everything that is in the holy writings was written to teach us. They give hope and strength when we have troubles. The holy writings comfort our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.5'>God gives people power to take their troubles and he comforts their hearts. I ask him to help you to think the same way as Christ did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.6'>Then, together you will praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.7'>So, accept one another, as Christ has accepted you. Then people will know that God is great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.8'>What I say is this. Christ came to serve the Jews. He did this to prove that what God said was true. He proved that God kept his promises to the fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.9'>He did this so that people who are not Jews would praise God because he is kind. The holy writings say, So I will praise you among the people who are not Jews. I will sing songs to your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.10'>The holy writings also say, People who are not Jews, be glad with those who are Gods people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.11'>And they also say, People who are not Jews, praise the Lord. All peoples should praise him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.12'>Also, Isaiah says, Someone from Jesses family will come. He will come to rule the people who are not Jews. People who are not Jews will have hope in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.13'>God gives hope. May he make you very happy. May he give you peace because you believe. Then the power of the Holy Spirit will give you much hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.14'>My brothers, I myself believe that you are very good people. I believe that you know many things and are able to teach one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>I have written strong words to you. There are some things I want you to remember. I have written because of the gift God has given to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.16'>I am a servant of Christ Jesus to the people who are not Jews. I am like a priest to them,  to tell them Gods good news. Then I offer the people to God. That pleases God. They have been accepted by him and made holy by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.17'>So, because of Christ Jesus, I am proud of my work for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>I will speak only of what Christ has done through me. People who are not Jews have obeyed the good news. They have obeyed because of what I told them and because of what I did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>I had the power to do signs and wonderful things through the power of the Holy Spirit. So I have told the good news of Christ all the way from the city of Jerusalem to the country of Illyricum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>I have wanted to tell the good news where people have not heard the name of Christ. I did not want to work where another man had started to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>The holy writings say, They were not told about him, but they will see him. And the people who have not heard of him will understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>So I have been stopped many times from coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>But now, I am no longer needed to work in these places. And I have wanted for many years to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>When I go to the country of Spain, I hope to see you on my way there. I hope you will help me on my way to that place. But first I will be happy to be with you for a little while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>But now I am going to Jerusalem with a gift to help Gods people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>The people of Macedonia and Achaia wanted to send a gift to help Gods people in Jerusalem who are poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>They wanted to do it, and they should do it for them. The Jews gave the people who were not Jews the good things their spirits need. So the people who were not Jews should give the Jews the good things their bodies need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>I will finish doing this, and I will give them what the people send them. Then I will go by you on my way to Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>And I know that when I come to you, I will bring great blessings from Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>My brothers, I ask you to do this for the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ and because the Spirit has given you love. Talk to God for me. And I also will talk to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>Ask him to save me from the people in Judea who do not believe. Ask him that the gift I take to Jerusalem may please Gods people there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.32'>Ask him to let me come to you and have a good time with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.33'>God gives peace. I ask that he will be with you all. He will!</verse>

You, too,  are chosen to be Gods people. And we send greetings to all the people everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. He is their Lord, just as he is our Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>My Christian brothers, I beg you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, agree in what you say. Do not divide into groups. You should all think in the same way and decide to do the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>My brothers, I say this because I have been told by some of Chloes family that you are quarrelling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>This is what I mean. Some of you say, I belong to Paul. Others say, I belong to Apollos. And others say, I belong to Cephas.And yet others say, I belong to Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>Christ did not send me to baptize people, but he sent me to tell the good news. I must not tell it with the clever words of this world. That would not show what the death of Christ on a cross truly means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>When people who are turning away from God hear about the cross, they say, That is foolish! But for us who are being saved, the cross is the power God uses to save us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where are your wise people, the men who know books, the men who like to talk about the things of this world? God has shown that the clever things of this world are nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>God is wise. But the people of the world were not wise enough to know God. So he chose to save people who believe the good news that we tell them, even though the good news may seem to be foolish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>The Jews say, We must see a sign. Those who are not Jews say, We want something we can understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>But we tell people about Christ who died on a cross. The leaders of the Jews do not like this, and those who are not Jews laugh at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>But some have been called by God. They are chosen, both Jews and other people. Christ is Gods power to save them. This shows how wise he is.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>My brothers, remember what you were when God chose you. Not many of you were wise by the way people look at it. Not many of you had power. Not many of you came from a family with a big name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But God chose things that look foolish to the people of the world. He has used those foolish things to put the wise people to shame. God chose the weak things to put to shame the strong people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>I made up my mind that I would talk about only one thing while I was with you. That one thing was Jesus Christ and his death on a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>I was weak, afraid, and trembling when I visited you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>My words and my message were not in wise words to win you. But the power of the Spirit of God proved my words to be true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>I did this so that you would not believe because of mans wise words, but you would believe because of Gods power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>However, our words are wise words to those who really believe. But they are not the kind of wise words that the people of this world speak. They are not the kind of wise words that the rulers of this world speak. Those rulers will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>Our wise words are Gods wise words about things people do not understand. Before God made the world he planned those things for our glory and blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>None of the rulers of this world knew about these things. If they had, they would not have killed on a cross the Lord who was full of Gods glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>The holy writings say, No eye has seen the things God has made ready for those who love him. No ear has heard about them. No persons heart has ever thought of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>God has shown these things to us by his Spirit. The Spirit understands everything, even the things that God has kept secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>The only one who really knows what a person is thinking is the spirit of the person himself. So also, no one knows what God is thinking, only the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>We have not received the spirit of the world. But we have received the Spirit of God. In this way we may understand the blessings which God has freely given to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>We do not tell you these things in wise words which men taught us. But the Holy Spirit taught us. We teach things about the Spirit which we know about through the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>The person who does not have the Spirit does not receive the blessings of the Spirit of God. He thinks they are foolish. He cannot understand them because only people who have the Spirit of God can test them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>He who has the Spirit of God tests all things. But others cannot test him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>The holy writings say: Who knows the mind of the Lord so that he may teach him? As for us, we really do have the mind of Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>My brothers, I could not talk to you at first as to people who have the Spirit of God. But I talked to you as people who have the spirit of this world. I talked to you as people who are very new-born, baby Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I gave you milk to drink, not food to eat. You were not ready for food. And even now you are not ready for it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>One says, I belong to Paul. Another says, I belong to Apollos. Does not that show that you have the spirit of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>After all, who is Apollos? And who is Paul? We both work for God. You believed because of the work we did. The Lord gave each of us our work to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted the seed. Apollos put water on the seed. But God made the seed grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then the man who plants is nothing and the man who waters is nothing. God alone makes the seed grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>The man who plants and the man who waters are equal. Each one will be paid for his own work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>We work together for God. You are Gods farm. You are Gods house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>I built the lower walls of the house because God showed me the best way to do it. Now another man builds on top of this foundation. Each man must take care how he builds on it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>But the day will come when everyones work can be seen. Their work will be tested by fire and the fire will show what kind of work each one did.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>But if a mans work is burned up, he will lose everything. He himself will be saved, like a man pulled out of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>You know that you are Gods house. The spirit of God lives in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>God will punish anyone who spoils his house. His house is holy, and you are the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Do not be fooled. If any one of you thinks that he is wise in the things of this world, he should count himself as not being wise. Then he would really be wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>The things that look wise to the people of this world look foolish to God. The holy writings say, He catches the wise people in their own tricks.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>So do not judge me before it is time. Wait until the Lord comes. The things which have been kept hidden in the dark he will bring out into the light. He will show what is in peoples hearts. At that time God will tell each man how good his work is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>My brothers, I have said these things about Apollos and myself so that you will learn from us to live the way the holy writings say. Then you will not be proud and say, This teacher is better than that one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>If you are better, who made you that way? Everything you have was given to you. So then, why are you proud of it? Was it not given to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>So you think you now have everything you need and are rich! You think you are kings and do not need us! I wish that you really were kings. Then we would be kings along with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>It seems to me that God has put us apostles at the end of the line. We are like men who are to be put to death. The whole world, angels and men, look at us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for Christs sake! But you think Christ has made you wise. We are weak,  but you are strong! You have glory, we have shame!</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>That is why I am sending Timothy to you. I love Timothy very much. He is my Christian son. I can trust him. He will tell you again my Christian ways of living. I teach these same ways in every church meeting everywhere.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>I have heard a very bad report about you. I hear there are wrong sexual ways among you. Even the people who are not Jews do not allow wrong sex such as this among them.  A man is living with his fathers wife!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>Can it be that you are still proud? This should make you very sad. The man who has done this should be put out of the church meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>My body is not with you, but my spirit is. Just as if I were right there, I have decided what to do about the man who did such a thing as this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>Do this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. When you meet together my spirit will be with you. Then, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, give this man over to Satan. Let Satan punish his body. By this the mans spirit may yet be saved when the Lord Jesus comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>Surely it is not right for you to be proud. Do you not know that only a little yeast in the bread will make all the bread rise?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Clean out the old yeast so that you will become like new bread. You are free from the old things. Christ, the Passover Lamb, has been killed for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Let us then remember the feast of Passover and have our bread. But let us not have our feast with old yeast in the bread. To do bad and wrong things is like that old yeast. But let us have it with new bread that has no old yeast in it. To be honest and true is like the new bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>I wrote a letter to you. I told you not to be friends with people who use sex the wrong way &lt;FI&gt;with a person they are not married to&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>

To keep away from them altogether would mean you would have to go out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>But I wrote to you not to be friends with anyone who says he is a Christian and uses wrong sex, or always wants more, or has idols, or curses, or drinks too much strong drink, or steals. I told you not even to sit down to eat with such a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>Why should I judge the people who are outside the church? You are to judge the church people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Do you not know that bad people will have no part in the kingdom where God rules? Do not be fooled. There are some people who will not have part in that place. They are those who commit adultery of any kind, those who have idols, or steal, or are always wanting more, or talk wrong things about people, or drink plenty of strong drink, or take things by force, or curse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>Some of you were like that. But now you have been washed and made holy. The Spirit of our God has made you right by the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>You wrote me a letter. Here is my answer to the things in the letter. It is good if a man has nothing to do with a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>But wrong sex is always a danger to us. So it is better for each man to have his own wife and each woman to have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>The husband should give his wife what is right. So also, the wife should give her husband what is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife does not have full right over her own body. But her husband has a right to it. In the same way, the husband does not have full right over his own body. But his wife has a right to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not keep from the other what is right for them to have. It is all right to stay from each other for a while, if you both agree to it. Then you will have time for prayer. Afterwards,  come together again. If you do not, Satan might tempt you to do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>I say you may do this. I do not say that you must do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>I wish that all men were like I am. But God has made everyone different. One man can live one way and another man can live another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>Here is what I say to those who are not married and to those whose husbands are dead.  It is good for them to stay the way I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>But if they cannot keep themselves under control, then they should marry. It is better to marry than to burn with desire for sex.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>And here is what I say to those who are married. (And yet it is not what I say. It is what the Lord has said.) The wife may not leave her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>But if she does leave him, she must not marry again, or she must come back to her husband again. And the husband may not send away his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>Here is what I say to other people. (This is my word, not the Lords.) Perhaps a Christian brother has a wife who is not a Christian. If she wants to stay with him, then he should not send her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>Perhaps a woman has a husband who is not a Christian. If he wants to stay with her, then the woman should not leave him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>The husband who is not a Christian is made holy by the wife. And the wife who is not a Christian is made holy by the husband. If this were not so, then your children would not be holy. But they are holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>If the one who is not a Christian really wants to leave, let him go. The Christian husband or wife is free then. God has called us to live in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.16'>Wife, you do not know. Perhaps you will win your husband to the Lord. Husband, you do not know. Perhaps you will win your wife to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.17'>Only let me say this. Every man should go on living in the way which the Lord chooses for him. He should go on as he was when God called him to be a Christian. I say this to people in all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.18'>If a man was already circumcised when God called him, he should not try to change the marks of it. If a man was not circumcised when God called him, he should not be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.19'>It does not matter whether one is circumcised or not. The thing that matters is doing what God says we must do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Everyone should stay the way he was when God called him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>If you were a slave when God called you, do not let that trouble you. But if there is some way for you to get free, then do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>If a man was a slave when the Lord called him, he is the Lords free man. So also if a man was free when he was called, he is Christs slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.23'>You were bought and paid for. Do not become slaves of men!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.24'>So, Christian brothers, everyone should go on living as he was when God called him. But now he lives with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.25'>Here is what I say about those who are not married. (I have no law from the Lord about this. But here is what I think. You can trust me because the Lord has helped me.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.26'>I think that, since there is now trouble in the world, it is good for each one to stay as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.27'>If you have married a wife, do not try to be free from her. If you have no wife, do not look for one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.28'>But, if you marry, it is not wrong. And if a woman marries, it is not wrong. People who marry will have trouble in this life. And I want to keep you out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.29'>Here, my brothers, is what I mean. The time is short. In the time that is left, men who have wives should live as though they did not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.30'>People who cry should live as though they were not sad. People who laugh should live as though they were not glad. People who buy things should live as though they did not own them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.31'>And people who are busy with things in this world should not be too busy. The world as we see it is passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.32'>I want your minds to be free. The man who is not married thinks about the things of the Lord. He tries to please the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.33'>But the man who is married thinks about the things of this world. He tries to please his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>In the same way, there is a difference between the woman who is married and the one who is not. The woman who is not married thinks about the things of the Lord. She wants her body and her spirit to be holy. But the married woman thinks about the things of this life. She tries to please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>I say this to help you, not to make it hard for you. I want to show you what is good. I do not want anything to stop you from serving the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>And if a man feels that he is doing the right thing for the woman he is to marry, then let him marry her. That is, if she is no longer young, and if he wants her very much. Then he must do as he thinks best. It is not wrong for him to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>But the man who has made up his mind not to marry his woman will do well. That is, if he does not have to marry her, and is able to control himself, and if he is sure about it in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So the man who marries his woman will do what is good. But the man who does not marry her will do better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A wife may not leave her husband as long as he is living. But if he dies, she is free to marry any man she wants. Only this, he must be a Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.40'>But I think that she is happier if she stays as she is and does not marry again. (I think too that I am saying what the Spirit of God wants me to say in this matter.)</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.1'>Now here is what I say about food given to idols. We all know something about this matter. Yet knowledge makes us proud. Love is the real teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.2'>If anyone thinks he knows much, then he does not know what he really should know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.3'>But if anyone loves God, then God knows him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.4'>So here is what I say about eating food that has been given to idols or false gods. We know that an idol really is nothing in this world. There is only one true and living God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.6'>Yet for us there is only one God. He is the Father. All things come from him. He is the one for whom we live. And there is only one Lord. He is Jesus Christ. He made all things.  He is the one who gives us life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.7'>But not every Christian knows these things. Some of them have always believed in idols.  And when they eat food which has been given to an idol, they think the food belongs to the idol. And because they are weak Christians they feel they do wrong when they eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.8'>One thing is sure, food will not bring us closer to God. If we eat it, it will not make us right with God. And if we do not eat, it will not make us wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.9'>Perhaps you feel it is all right for you to do it. But be careful! It might make the weak Christian do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.10'>You know it is not wrong for you to eat these things. But if a weak Christian sees you eating in the idols house, he will also want to eat food that has been given to an idol. He will do what is against his own belief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.11'>You know the truth, and yet your knowledge will make your weak brother do wrong.  You have hurt the faith of a brother, for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.12'>In this way you do wrong to your brother. You hurt him because he is weak. And in so doing you do wrong to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.13'>If eating such food makes my brother do wrong, I will never eat it. I do not want my brother to do wrong.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.10'>Does he not say this altogether for our sakes? Yes, he said it for our sakes. There are people who plough the ground and beat the grain. They do this work because they believe they will have a part of the food for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.11'>We have planted seed by teaching you the good things of the Spirit. So we should receive something from you to help us to pay for our living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.12'>If it is right for other teachers to receive something from you, then we have more of a right to receive it. But we did not use our right. Instead, we do anything we can so that we will not stop the good news of Christ from going out.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.21'>When I was with those who do not have the law of the Jews, I lived as if I did not have the law of the Jews. I did this so that I might win them also. Of course, I myself have laws. I follow the laws of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.22'>When I was with weak people, I lived like a weak person. I did this so that I might win weak people to Christ. I lived like all kinds of people to save some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.23'>I do all this for the good news, so that I also will have some of its blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.24'>You know when people are running a race, they all run. But only one man will win. The way you should run is to run to win.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.26'>So I do not run as if I did not know where I was going. And I do not fight like a man just beating the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.27'>But I control my own body really well. I make my body obey me. After telling others the good news, I myself do not want to be left out.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.1'>My brothers, here is something you should know. Long ago, all our fathers were led by the cloud of God over them. They all went through the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.2'>It was as if they were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.3'>They all ate the same food from the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.4'>They all drank the same water sent by the Spirit. The water they drank came from a Rock of the Spirit which went with them. That Rock was Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.5'>But God was not pleased with most of them. They died in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.6'>This teaches us not to want wrong things as they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.7'>Do not worship idols, as some of them did. The holy writings say, The people sat down to eat and drink. Then they got up and danced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.8'>We must not use sex the wrong way as some of them did. Twenty-three thousand people died in one day!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.9'>We must not test the Lord, as some of them did. They were bitten by bad snakes and died!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.10'>Do not grumble, as some of them did. They were killed by the Angel of Death!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.11'>These things happened to them to teach other people. They were written in the holy writings to teach us who are living in the last days of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.12'>Therefore, when a person thinks, I am strong; I can stand, let that person be careful, or he will fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.13'>No testing has come to you that other people do not have. But God will not fail you. He will not allow the testing to be too hard for you. No. When the testing comes, God will make a way out for you, so that you can go through the testing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.14'>So then, my dear brothers, do not worship idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.15'>I talk to you as people with good sense. Decide for yourselves about what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.16'>We ask God to bless the cup at the Lords supper. When we drink from this cup it means that the blood of Christ is for us all. We break the bread. When we eat this bread, it means that the body of Christ is for us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.17'>The bread is all one loaf. In the same way, we are many people but we are one body. We all eat from the same loaf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.18'>See what the Jews do. Those who eat the sacrifices all eat things that are sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.19'>What do I mean by saying this? Is the food that has been given to idols really something holy? Or is an idol really something like God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.20'>No. What I mean is this. Those people give the food to bad spirits and not to God. I do not want you to have anything to do with bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.21'>You cannot drink from the cup of the Lord and from the cup of bad spirits. You cannot eat food at the table of the Lord and at the table of bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.22'>Do we want to make the Lord jealous? Are we stronger than he is? No!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.23'>We are free to do anything we want to do. Yes, but some things do not make people better. It is better if we do not do such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.24'>A person must not think only of himself. But he should think of the other person as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.25'>Eat any meat that is sold at the market. Do not ask any questions about it because you think, Is it wrong to eat it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.26'>The holy writings say, The earth belongs to the Lord and everything that is in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.27'>If one who is not a believer asks you to come and eat, if you want to go, then eat the food he gives you. Do not ask any questions about it because you fear it might be wrong to eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.28'>But if anyone says to you, This food has been given to an idol, then do not eat it. Do not eat it because of the one who told you and because it might seem wrong. I mean it might seem wrong, not to you, but to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.29'>Since I am free, is it wrong for me to eat just because someone else thinks it is?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.30'>I thank God for my food. So why should anyone say it is wrong for me to eat what I thank God for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.31'>So, whether you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do everything to bring praise to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.32'>Do nothing that will make Jews, or Greeks, or those who belong to the church of God,  turn away from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.33'>I, also, try to please everyone in all I do. I do not think of what will be good for me, but I think of what will be good for many people. I want them to be saved.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.1'>Do as I do, for I am doing as Christ did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.2'>You are doing well. You remember everything I told you. And you are doing what I taught you to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.3'>But I want you to know this. Christ is the head of every man. The husband is the head of the wife. And God is the head of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.4'>Any man who talks to God or speaks words from God with his head covered brings shame on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.5'>But any woman who talks to God or speaks words from God with her head not covered brings shame on her head. She is just the same as a woman who has cut off all her hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.6'>If a woman does not cover her head, she might as well cut off her hair. But if it is a shame for a woman to cut off her hair, or to shave her head, then she should have her head covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.7'>A man does not need to cover his head because he was made like God is. Man is Gods glory. Woman is mans glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.8'>Man was not made from woman, but woman was made from man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.9'>And man was not made for woman, but woman was made for man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.10'>She should show this by having her head covered, because of the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.11'>But the Lord did not make woman without man, and he did not make man without woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.12'>As woman comes from man, so man is born by woman. And everything comes from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.13'>What do you think? Does it look right for a woman to talk to God in public with her head not covered?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.14'>It would be a shame for a man to have long hair. Everyone knows this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.15'>But long hair is something for the woman to be proud of. Her hair has been given to her for a covering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.16'>Does anyone still want to quarrel about this matter? This is what we do. And this is what the churches of God do also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.17'>In the next thing I have to talk about, I cannot say that you are doing well. Your meeting together is more bad than good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.18'>First, I hear that in the church meeting you divide yourselves into groups. I think this may be true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.19'>You also have groups of people who do not think the same way. Because of them you will soon learn which people please God the most.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.20'>When you meet together, it is not the Lords supper that you eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.21'>People take their own food and eat it without waiting. One gets nothing to eat. Another person drinks too much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.22'>Do you not have your own homes where you can eat and drink? Do you have no respect for the church of God? Do you want to make poor people ashamed? What shall I say to you? Shall I say you are doing well? No, you are not doing well in this matter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.23'>The Lord gave me what I taught you. This is what it was. On the night when the Lord Jesus was sold to his enemies, he took bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.24'>He thanked God for it. Then he broke it and said, Take this bread and eat it. This is my body which is broken for you. Do this so that you will remember me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.25'>In the same way, after they had eaten, he took the cup. He said, This cup is the new agreement made by my blood. Every time you drink from this cup, do it to remember me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.26'>Every time you eat this bread and drink from this cup you tell about the Lords death,  until he comes again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.27'>So then, when anyone eats the bread and drinks from the cup in a way that is not right,  he has done wrong to the body and blood of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.28'>Each one must look into his own heart carefully. When he has done that, he may eat the bread and drink from the cup.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.29'>The person who eats and drinks in a wrong way will be punished. He does not take it as the Lords body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.30'>That is why many of you are weak and sick. Many have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.31'>But if we took time to look into our hearts first, then we would not be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.32'>When we are punished, the Lord is teaching us to do right, so that we will not be punished with the rest of the people of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.33'>So, my Christian brothers, when you come together to eat the Lords supper, wait on your turn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.34'>If a man is hungry, he should eat at home. Then when you meet, you will not be found in the wrong. There are other matters. I will talk about them when I come to see you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.1'>Now, my Christian brothers, I want you to know something about the gifts given by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.2'>You know that before you believed in God, you were led by other men to believe in idols that could not talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.3'>Therefore, I want you to understand this. No person who has the Spirit of God ever curses Jesus. And no one can say, Jesus is Lord, if he is not controlled by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.4'>There are different gifts, but there is only one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.5'>There are different kinds of work, but there is only one Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.6'>There are different ways of working, but there is only one God. He works in all people and does it all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.7'>And the Holy Spirit gives each one a gift so that all people may be helped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.8'>The Spirit gives one person wise words to say. The same Spirit gives another person words of good understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.9'>To another person the same Spirit gives faith, and to another person he gives the power to heal people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.10'>To another person the Spirit gives the power to do big works. Another can speak words from God. To another person he gives the power to know the difference between spirits.  To another person he gives the gift to speak the words of God in other tongues or languages, and to another the meaning of these different tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.11'>And the same Spirit gives the power for all these things. He gives each person what he wants to give to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.12'>A person has only one body, and the body has many parts. It is the same with Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.13'>The one Spirit baptized us all to make one body. It made no difference whether we were Jews or Greeks, whether we were slaves or free men. We were all given to drink of one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.14'>I say again, the body is not all one part, but has many parts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.15'>Perhaps the foot says, I am not the hand, so I do not belong to the body. But it is still a part of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.16'>Perhaps the ear says, I am not the eye, so I do not belong to the body. But it is still a part of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.17'>If all of the body were an eye, how could we hear? If all the body were an ear, how could we smell?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.18'>The way it is now, God has put each part in the body in the place he wanted it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.19'>If they were all one part, how could it be a body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>The way it is now, there are many parts, but it is one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>The eye cannot say to the hand, I do not need you. And the head cannot say to the feet,  I do not need you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>No, that is not so. Some parts of the body are not as strong as others. Yet we could not live without them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>And we look after some parts of our body more than others because they need it. The parts of our body that are not so fine in one way are made more fine in other ways. But the parts which are fine already do not need to be made fine. God made the body and has given more care to the parts that need it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>He did this so that the body would not be divided into groups, but all the parts would help each other. 26)If one part has trouble, then all the other parts are troubled too. If one part is praised, then all the other parts are glad with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>Now, all of you together are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>God has given each person their right place in the church. First, there are the apostles.  Second, there are prophets who speak words from God. Third, there are those who teach. Then there are those who do big works. Then there are those who have the gifts to heal people, those who help in the work of the church people, those who lead and guide others, and those who speak Gods words in different kinds of tongues or languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Are all the people apostles? Can they all speak words from God? Can they all teach? Can they all do big works?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>Do they all have the gifts to heal the sick people? Can they all speak in different tongues?  Can they all tell the meaning of these tongues?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.29'>You should seek after the best gifts. But I will show you a way that is much better than any of them!</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What shall we do about it, my brothers? When you meet together, every one of you has something to help the other. One has a song to sing. One has something to teach people.  One has something which God has shown to him. One has something to say in a tongue.  One can tell the meaning of a tongue. Do all of these things to help one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If any people talk in a tongue, only two or not more than three should talk. They must talk one at a time and someone must tell the meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there is no one to tell the meaning, a person must not talk in a tongue of a different language in the church meeting. He should talk to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Two or three prophets may speak words from God and the others should say what they think about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>But if another person is sitting by and God gives him something to say, then the first person should stop talking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>One by one you may speak words from God. In that way, all will learn something and all will be stronger in faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>Those who speak words from God are able to keep their own spirits quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>God does not want things to be out of order. He wants peace in the church meeting. In all the churches of Gods people, the women should be quiet in the church meetings. They must not be allowed to talk. They must obey. The holy writings say this also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>If the women want to know something, they should ask their own husbands at home. It is a shame for a woman to talk in a church meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>Do you think that you were the first ones to tell the word of God? Or do you think that you are the only people who have it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>Perhaps someone thinks, I am the one to speak words from God, or, I have the Spirit.  Then know this, the Lord has told me to write these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>If anyone does not know this, then God will not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>So, my brothers, the thing you should want is to speak words from God. But at the same time, do not stop anyone from talking in tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>But everything should be done in the right way and in good order.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Now, my brothers, I want to bring the good news to your minds again. I told it to you and you received it. You now believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>You are saved by it, if you hold on to what I told you. If you do not, then you have believed for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>I told you first what was told to me. I told you that Christ died for the wrong things we did, as the holy writings said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>He was buried. He was raised on the third day, as the holy writings said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>Peter saw him, and then all the twelve disciples saw him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>After that, more than five hundred Christian brothers saw him at one time. Most of them are still living, but some have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>After that, James saw him. Then all the apostles saw him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>Last of all, I saw him too. I was like one who was born at the wrong time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>The other apostles are all greater than I am. I should not be called an apostle because I troubled the people of Gods church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But God has been kind to me. He has made me what I am today. And he did not bless me for nothing. I did more work than any of them. Yet it was not I, but the loving kindness of God was working with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>So it does not matter who gave the message, they or I. This is the message we gave, and this is the message you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>You have been told that Christ was raised from death. How can some of you say that dead people do not rise again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>If dead people do not rise, Christ did not rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>And if Christ did not rise, then what we told you was not true, and what you believe is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>If this were so, we would have been telling lies about God, because we said that God raised up Christ. He did not raise up Christ if dead people are not raised up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>If dead people are not raised, then Christ was not raised either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>If Christ was not raised, then what you believe is no good. Your wrong ways have not been forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>If that were true, then the people who believed in Christ who have now died, are lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>And if we have hope in Christ for our life in this world only, then we are the most unhappy of all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But Christ really has been raised from death. He was the first one to rise of all who have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>It was a man who first brought death. So it was also a man who was first raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>All people who are of Adam die. And so also, all people who belong to Christ will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But each one has his turn. Christ rose first. Then those who belong to Christ will rise when he comes again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>After that the end will come. Christ will hand over the ruling power to God the Father.  Christ will stop all other rulers, and everyone who has any rights and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>Christ must rule until God has all power over all his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>Death is the last enemy to be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>The holy writings say, God has put all things under Christ. But it does not mean that God is under Christ. God is the one who put all things under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>One day the Son will be over all things. And God will be over the Son. So in the end God will be over all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Another thing, what good is it for people to be baptized for dead people? If dead people are not raised, why are some people baptized for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>And why are we in trouble all the time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>I face death every day! That is true. Just the way it is true that I am proud of you, my brothers. I am proud that you belong to Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>I fought against wild animals at Ephesus. If I was thinking only of life on earth, why did I do this? If dead people do not rise, then we might just as well say, Let us eat and drink because we will die tomorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Do not be fooled. If good people keep company with bad people, the good people will become bad too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Wake up! Do what is right. Stop doing wrong things. Some of you do not know God at all. I say these things to you to make you ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But someone will ask, How can dead people be raised? What kind of body will they have when they come back from death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>What foolish questions! The seed you put in the ground must die before it can come to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>You do not put a grown-up plant in the ground. You put in a seed, such as corn, wheat,  rice, or something like that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>God gives the seed the body he wants it to have. He gives a different kind of body to every kind of seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>Not all living bodies are alike. People have one kind of body. Animals have another kind of body. Fish another kind of body. Birds have another kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>So too, there are bodies for the sky and bodies for the earth. The bodies for the sky are fine in one way, and the bodies for the earth are fine in another way. They are not alike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>The sun is fine in one way. The moon is fine in another way. The stars are fine in still another way. And one star is fine in a different way from another star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So it is with the body that is raised from death. When it is put in the ground it is a body that dies. When it rises from death, it will never die again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>When it is put in the ground, it is not fine. When it rises, it is very fine. When it is put in the ground it has no strength. When it rises it is strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>When it is put in the ground it is only a body for this world. When it rises it is a body for the spirit. If there is a body for this world, then there is also a body for the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>The holy writings say, The first man, Adam, was of this world! The last Adam &lt;FI&gt;Christ&lt;Fi&gt; is a Spirit who gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>The body for the spirit does not come first. The body for this world comes first. Then comes the body for the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man came from earth. He was made from the dust of the earth. The second Adam is the Lord from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>Those who are made of earth are like the man made of dust. Those who are for heaven are like the man from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>We were made like the man of dust but we shall look like the man from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>Now I tell you, my brothers, our bodies of flesh and blood can have no place in the kingdom where God rules. A body which will die can have no room in the kingdom of God where people will never die. 51,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Listen! I tell you a secret. We will not all die, but we will all be changed. It will happen very quickly, as fast as one can shut his eyes. It will be when the trumpet or horn is blown the last time. Someone will blow the trumpet, dead people will rise, and they will never die again. We ourselves will be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>This body which dies must become a body which will never die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>When this body which dies becomes one which will never die, what the holy writings say comes true. It says, Death is overcome by victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>Death, you have lost the battle. Death, your power to hurt us is gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>Death hurts us because we are bad people. And our wrong ways are so strong because of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>But I thank God that he gives us power to stop being wrong through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>So, my dear brothers, stand strong. Do not be moved from what you believe. Work hard for the Lord. You know that your work for the Lord will not be for nothing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>All of us have no cloth over our faces. People can see that we have some of the bright and wonderful light that the Lord has. And we are becoming brighter and brighter, more and more like him. It is the Lord, the Spirit, who does this.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>I want to say something a little bit foolish. But please listen to me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>I love you as God loves you. I see you as a woman who has not been married and I am giving you to be the wife of a husband. That husband is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But the snake fooled Eve by his trick. And I am afraid that your minds will be drawn away from a clean, pure love of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>You listen to a new man when he comes to tell you about a different Jesus, which is not the one we told you about. And when you receive a spirit and a message which are not the ones you had first, then you listen too much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>But I really do not think that the chief apostles are any better than I am!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>Maybe I am not a good talker, but I surely know what I am talking about! Yes, we made this plain to you in every way in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Perhaps it was wrong for me to bring myself down in order to raise you up. Do you think that? Was it wrong for me to tell you the good news without pay?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I took pay from other churches. I made them poor so that I might help you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>When I was with you and needed money, I did not make any of you pay me. When the brothers came from Macedonia, they gave me what I needed. So I was not, and I will not be, any trouble to you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>And I will keep on doing what I am doing now. Some teachers are praising themselves.  They say they are like us. By doing this I prove they are not like us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>So it is not strange if his workers also try to make themselves look like Gods workers who do right. They will come to an end like the work they do! think that I am foolish. But if you do, then please listen to me as if I were foolish. I also want to do a little talking about myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>I am not talking like the Lord when I say this. It seems foolish to say so much about myself.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>I am ashamed, but I must say that we were too weak to be like that! Anything that others want to be proud of, I can talk about too. And yet it is really foolish to do so.</verse>

I have had hard times among those who should have been my brothers and were not.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.2'>I know a Christian man. Fourteen years ago he was taken up into the place where God lives. I do not know if he was in his body when he went or not. God knows if he was.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>I will talk about such a man. But I will not talk about myself. If I do talk, it will be about the ways I am weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>Now if I wanted to talk about myself, I would not be foolish. I would be telling the truth.  But I will not say any more. This is why: I do not want anyone to think I am better than what he sees I am, or hears me teach. I want him to judge me only by what he can see in me and by what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>Because the things God showed me were so wonderful, I might have become too proud of myself. But something happened and stopped that. It was like a thorn in me. It came from Satan &lt;FI&gt;the devil&lt;Fi&gt; to trouble me. It came to stop me from being too proud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>I begged the Lord three times that this trouble might leave me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>But he said to me, My kindness and strength is enough for you. When you are weak, my power is strong. So then, I am very glad to talk about how weak I am so that the power of Christ may live in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>So then, for the sake of Christ I am glad to be weak, to have people say wrong things about me, to be poor, to have people trouble me, and to have hard times. When I am weak, that is the time I am really strong, have been acting like one with no sense, but you have made me do it. You should have been talking about the good things I have done.  The very best apostles are not one bit better than I am, even though I am nothing at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>There are signs that show a true apostle. I did all these things when I was among you.  There were signs, wonderful works, and other big works which I did. You saw the power of God, even though I was being tested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.12'>In what way did you not receive as much as the other churches? Only this! I did not trouble you to pay me. Forgive me for the wrong I did you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.13'>Now, I am ready to come to you for the third time. And I will not trouble you to pay me.  I do not want what belongs to you, but I want you. The children should not save up for their parents, but the parents should do it for their children.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.17'>I asked Titus to go and I sent our brother with him. Did Titus get anything for himself?  No! Did we not act in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.18'>Am I saying all this just to you? Are we just trying to make ourselves look right to you?  No, we say this before God and in Christ. And my dear people, I have done it all to make you better Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.19'>I want to be pleased with you when I come. But I am afraid I will not be. And I am afraid that you will not be pleased with me. I fear that I may find quarrelling, jealousy, anger,  and that I will find you are enemies to each other, that you are spoiling each others names, that you are telling stories about each other, that you are proud and do not obey rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.20'>And I am afraid that when I come my God will make me ashamed of you. I am afraid that my heart will be very sad about you.

        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>I am Paul the apostle, a messenger from God. Men did not call me to be an apostle. Men did not make me an apostle. Jesus Christ and God the Father made me an apostle. It was the same God the Father who raised Jesus from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>All the Christian brothers who are with me and I, send greetings. To the churches in the province of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you with his loving kindness and give you peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>Christ gave his life to pay for the wrong things we have done. He did this to set us free from the wrong ways of this world. This is what our God and Father wanted him to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>All the praise for this belongs to God for ever and ever. Yes, it does!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I am very much surprised. It is so soon, and you are leaving God who called you by the love of Christ. Instead you are listening to another good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>There is really no other good news. But some people are making you think wrong things.  They want to change the good news of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>We are wrong if we tell you a different kind of good news. Even an angel from heaven is wrong to tell you something different. Let a punishment from God come upon us if we tell you a different kind of good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>We have said it before, and I say it again now. A curse be on any one who tells you a kind of good news which is not the good news we have already told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>Now, am I trying to please men or God? If I were still trying to please men, then I would not be the servant of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>My brothers, I want you to know this. The good news which I told you is not mans good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>No man told it to me. No man taught it to me. But it was Jesus Christ who showed it to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>You have heard how I lived while I was still under the law of the Jews. I troubled the church of God very much. And I even tried to stop the church people altogether.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>I knew more about the law of the Jews than many of my own age among my people. I wanted much more than they did to obey the laws which our fathers passed down to us,  even the ones that were not written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But God chose me to be an apostle before I was born. And he called me by his love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>God wanted to show his Son to me so that I might tell people who are not Jews about him. I did not go and ask any other person about the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>I did not go to Jerusalem to the men who were apostles before I was. But I went away into the country of Arabia. Then afterwards, I came back to the city of Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>Three years later, I went to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>James, the brother of the Lord, was the only other apostle I saw. I did not see any of the other apostles.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>They only heard people say, This is the man who used to trouble us and he is now telling others to believe what he once tried to stop.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Fourteen years later I went to Jerusalem again. This time I went with Barnabas and I took Titus with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>God showed me that I should go. And I told them about the good news which I tell to people who are not Jews. I told those who seemed to be church leaders when I was alone with them. I did not want my work to come to nothing-the work I had done or the work I was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>Titus was with me. He was not a Jew, but they did not force him to be circumcised &lt;FI&gt;have the mark of a Jew made on his body&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>But some men got in who were not true brothers. They came in secretly to spy on us to find out things about us. They did not want us to be free the way Christ Jesus has made us free. But they wanted to make us obey the old laws again &lt;FI&gt;which were given to Moses by God&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>But we did not let them tell us what to do, no, not even for one minute. In that way the real good news will be yours always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>Those men who seemed to be leaders did not teach me anything new. It does not matter to me who they were. God does not love some people more than others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>No, the leaders saw that God called me to take the good news to those who are not circumcised &lt;FI&gt;not Jews&lt;Fi&gt; , just as he called Peter to take the good news to those who are circumcised &lt;FI&gt;Jews&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>The same God who made Peter an apostle to the Jews made me an apostle to those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>The leaders saw that God had blessed me. James, Peter, and John seemed to be leaders in the church. They saw that God had blessed me. So they accepted Barnabas and me as fellow workers. They agreed that we should go to the people who were not Jews and they themselves would go to the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>One thing they asked us to do was to help the poor Christians. I was very glad to do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>One day Peter came to the city of Antioch. Then I had to tell him face to face that he had done wrong. He really was wrong!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>Here is what happened. Peter ate with those who were not Jews. Then some men came whom James had sent. When they came he stopped eating with those who were not Jews. He was afraid of what the Jews might think.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>All the other Jewish Christians did the same as Peter did. They acted as if it was not right to eat with those who were not Jews. Even Barnabas did the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But I saw they were not doing right. They were not obeying the true teaching of the good news. So I said to Peter in front of them all, You are a Jew. But you live the way people do who are not Jews. How then can you force those who are not Jews to live the way the Jews do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We ourselves were born Jews. We are not of those who still follow wrong ways, those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>Yet we know that God does not call a man good because he tries to obey the law of the Jews. But we know that God puts a man right because he believes in Jesus Christ. So we also believed in Jesus Christ. And we are put right with God because we believe in Christ and not because we obey the law. No person will ever be called good by God just because he tries to obey the law of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>We came to Christ to be put right with God. That showed us how much we had been bad men. Was it Christ who made us bad men? No, surely not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>If I build up again what I once broke down, I do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>Through the law I died. Now the law has no power over me so that I may live for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>I died when Christ died on a cross. I do not live now, but Christ lives in me. Now while I still live in my body, I live by believing in the Son of God. He loved me and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>So I do not make the love of God useless. But if a person can be made good by the law,  then Christ died for nothing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O you Galatians, have you no sense at all? Who has fooled you? You knew, just as if you had seen him with your own eyes, that Jesus Christ was killed on a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>Here is one thing I want to ask you. You received the Holy Spirit. Was that because you obeyed the law &lt;FI&gt;given to the Jews by Moses&lt;Fi&gt; ? No, it was because you heard Gods word and believed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Have you no sense at all? You began living your new life by the power of the Spirit. And are you now trying to finish living it by your own power &lt;FI&gt;to keep the law&lt;Fi&gt; ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>So many things happened to you. Was it all for nothing? Surely it was not for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>God gives you the Spirit. He does wonderful works among you. Does he do this because you obey the law? No, he does it because you heard the word of God and believed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>So it was with Abraham. The holy writings say He believed God, and that was why God called him a good man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>You see then, the people who believe God are children of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>The holy writings say that he will put people right with himself if they believe him, even those who are not Jews. It was written down before God did it. The holy writings told the good news to Abraham ahead of time. It said, God will make you a blessing to all nations and people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>Abraham believed God and was blessed. And so those who believe God are blessed too,  along with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>A curse is on all people who are trying to become good by obeying the law. The holy writings say, Everyone is cursed who does not always obey everything that is written in the book of the law and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>Now, you can see this. No man is called a good man by God because he obeys the law.  The holy writings say, Those who are right with God shall live by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>The law does not ask people to believe. It says, He who obeys the laws will live because of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ has saved us from the curse which the law put on us. He took the curse on himself.  It should have been on us. The holy writings say, A curse be on everyone who hangs on a tree!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>Christ Jesus did this so that those who are not Jews will have the blessing which Abraham had. He did this so that when we believe, we will receive the Spirit who was promised to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>My brothers, it is the same as when a man makes a promise. He makes it good and strong. Then no one can break it or add anything to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>God made his promises to Abraham and to his Son. The promise does not have the words, and to his sons, for that means many sons. But it says, and to his Son, and that Son is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>Here is what I mean. The law was given &lt;FI&gt;to Moses&lt;Fi&gt; four hundred and thirty years after God gave that promise to Abraham. But it cannot break the strong promise which God made. And the law cannot change Gods promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>Do we get what God has promised us by obeying the law? If we do, then we are not getting it by his promise. But God gave it to Abraham by his promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Why then was the law made? God gave it after he made the promise, because so many people were doing what was wrong. The law was to be in power only until the Son came,  the one to whom the promise was made. The law was handed down by Gods angels with the help of a middle man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>To need the help of a middle man there must be more than one person making the agreement. But God is the only one who made the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Is the law against the promises of God? No, it is not! If a law had been given that could give people life, then surely people would have become good people by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the holy writings say it is like this. The whole world is in prison, kept there by the wrong things they have done. This was done so that people who believe in Jesus Christ would have the blessing. This blessing was promised to those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>Before one came for us to believe in, the law held us in prison like slaves. We were kept there until the one to believe in should come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>The law watched over us, as if we were children, until Christ came. Then God would put us right with himself through faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But now that one has come for us to believe in, the law does not watch over us any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>You are all Gods children because you have believed in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>All of you who have been baptised into Christ have taken Christ as your own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There is no longer any difference between a Jew and one who is not a Jew; between a slave and a free man; between a man and a woman. When you are in the body of Christ Jesus, you are all alike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>If you belong to Christ, you are Abrahams children. And if you are Abrahams children,  you will receive the blessing that God has promised.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>Here is what I mean. When a man dies, his son is to receive his property. As long as the son is not grown up, he cannot have it. He has no more right than a servant, even though he really owns all the property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>He still has people who take care of him and he must obey them until the time set by his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>So it is with us. Before we were grown up, we were like servants. We were just beginning to learn about the things of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>But when the right time came, God sent his Son to make us free. He was born by a woman during the time when men had to obey the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>God sent him to set the people free who were under the law. God sent him so that we would receive our rights as sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts. The Spirit calls out, Father!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>So then, because of what God has done, you are no longer a slave but you are a son. And because you are a son, you will receive what he promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>At first, you did not know God. At that time you obeyed things which are not real gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>But now you know God. That is, God knows you. Then why do you turn to things that are weak and can do no good? Do you want to obey them again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>You have holy days, holy months, holy seasons, and holy years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I fear that all my work for you has been for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>My brothers, I beg you, be like me because I am like you. You did me no wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>You know that I was sick when I first told you the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>My sickness troubled you. But you did not think wrongly of me or turn away from me.  You received me as if I were an angel from God, as if I were Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>Why are you not happy any more? I saw myself that you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me if you could do such a thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>Do you hate me because I tell you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>Other people are trying hard to get you on their side. But they do not mean to help you.  They want to get you away from Christ so that you will listen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>Of course, it is good if someone tries to help you, but only if it is for a good reason. It is always good, not only when I am with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My dear children, I feel pain for you again, like a mother when her child is being born. I will feel pain until Christ lives in your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>I wish I could be with you now, and not have to talk this way. But I am troubled about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, you people that want the law to control you, why do you not listen to the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>The holy writings say that Abraham had two sons. One was the son of the slave woman.  The other one was the son of the free woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>The child of the slave woman was born as any child is born. But the child of the free woman was born because God promised he would be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>These things have another meaning. These two women are like two agreements. One agreement came from Mount Sinai. The children are born slaves. That agreement is like Hagar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>So Hagar means Mount Sinai in the country of Arabia. She is like the city of Jerusalem today, because Jerusalem is a slave and her children are too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>But the city of Jerusalem in heaven is free, and that is our mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>The holy writings say, The woman who has not had a child, be happy! You who do not feel the pain of bearing a child, open your mouth and shout. The woman who is left alone has more children than the woman who has a husband!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>My brothers, we are like Isaac. We are born because God made a promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>Abrahams child who was born as any child is born, troubled the other child who was born by the Spirit. It is that way today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>But what does the holy writings say? They says, Put away the slave woman and her son.  The son of the slave woman will have nothing when the father dies. The son of the free woman will have everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>So, my brothers, we are not the children of the slave woman, but we are children of the free woman.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>Christ has made us really free. So, stay free! Do not let yourselves be made slaves again.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>Again I say to every man who is circumcised, he must obey all the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>Some of you are trying to obey the law, so that God will call you good. If you do this,  you have been cut off from Christ. You have lost the blessing of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>These teachers are troubling your minds. How I wish they would cut themselves off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not take that to mean that you can do as you please. But work for each other because you love each other.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>So I say, let the Spirit tell you what you should do. Then you will not do the wrong things you yourselves want to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>People want to do wrong things that the Spirit does not want them to do. And the Spirit wants people to do things they do not want to do. The Spirit and the wrong things you want to do are against each other, so that you do not do what you yourself want to do.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>It is easy to see the wrong things people want to do. Both married people and those who are not married commit adultery. People make themselves unclean because of their wrong use of sex. They do things they should be ashamed of doing.</verse>

They do other things like these. I have told you before and I tell you again. Those who do these things will not be in the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But these are the things which the Spirit wants you to show: love, joy, peace, patience,  being kind, being good, being true, being gentle, and keeping the body under control.  There is no law that says, These things are wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>Those who belong to Christ Jesus have stopped doing the wrong things they want to do.  They have stopped them just as if they were killed on a cross. And they have even stopped wanting to do them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'>Now he wants those who rule and have power in the sky to know how very wise God is.  They will know this when they look at the church people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.11'>This is what God has always planned to do. And he did it in Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.12'>In Christ we are not to be afraid to come to God. We are sure we can come because we believe in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.13'>So I ask you not to be sad when you think of the troubles I have for your sake. You should be proud about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'>That is why I kneel down before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.15'>From him every family in heaven or on earth gets its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.16'>I ask him to make you very strong in heart by his Spirit. He has great and wonderful blessings and is able to do so because of the fullness of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.17'>And I ask that Christ may live in your hearts because you believe in him. I ask that you may live and grow in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.18'>I ask that God will give you power to know how wide and long and high and deep the love of Christ is. All Christians should know that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.19'>I ask God that you may know the love of Christ which is more than we can ever know. I ask that you may be filled with everything that God has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.21'>God can do much more than we ask him to do, or we even think of. He does it by his power which is working in us. So, praise him in the church meeting in Christ Jesus.  Praise him for ever and ever! May it be so!</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>I am a prisoner who belongs to the Lord. I beg you, live the way people should live who have been called by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'>Do not be proud at all. Be very humble. Love one another and be patient with each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'>The Spirit has made you all one. Try to stay like that. May you be at peace with one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.4'>There is one body of Christ and one Spirit. When God called you, there was one hope before you in your calling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'>There is one Lord, one way to believe, and one baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'>There is one God and Father of us all. He is over all. He works through all. And he is living in us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'>But each one of us has received a blessing, whatever amount Christ has given to each one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'>So then, the holy writings say, When Christ went up to heaven he took those he had won with him. And he gave gifts to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'>Now, what does he went up mean? Does it not mean that he also came down to the earth below?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'>The one who came down is the same one who went up higher than all the heavens. He did this so that he would be everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'>The gifts he gave are these: some are to be apostles; some prophets; some evangelists;  some pastors and teachers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'>These gifts are to make Gods people better able to do their work for him and to make the body of Christ become stronger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'>The gifts are given so that we will all believe the one way and all know the Son of God.  They are given so that we will be really grown-up Christians, like Christ himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>The body of Christ must grow so that we will no longer be like children. We are like children when we are pushed this way and that way. We change our minds every time people bring a different teaching. Some teachers teach the lies of men and fool people so that they believe wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>We must say what is true and say it with love. In that way we will grow up in all things to be like Christ, who is the head of this body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'>The whole body is joined and held together by every joint that it has. It is from Christ that the whole body grows as each different part does its work. It grows so that it becomes stronger in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>Here then is what the Lord has told me to say. You must not live like the people who do not believe in God. They do not think clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>Their minds are dark. They are far away from Gods life because they do not know the truth. They have no love in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>Nothing makes them ashamed anymore. They live a very bad life. They do every kind of wrong thing. And they always want to do it more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>That is not what you have learned from Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>You were taught by him, and Jesus has the truth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'>Stop being the person you used to be in your old life. That person was bad because he wanted to do wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'>Have a new mind and heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>Be a new person. That new person has been made like God. He does what is right and holy because he knows the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>So stop telling lies. Tell the truth to each other. We all are parts of the same body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>When you are angry, do not do anything wrong. And do not stay angry after the sun goes down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'>Do not let the devil control you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>The person who used to steal must not steal now. But he must do some good work with his own hands. Then he will have something to give to the poor people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>Do not let any bad words come out of your mouth. But say good things that will help people. Then those who hear you will also be blessed by what you say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>Do nothing that makes the Holy Spirit feel sad. He is the mark God has put on you until the day you will belong to God altogether.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>You must stop all hate, big and small anger, loud talk, saying wrong things about people,  and all wanting to do wrong things to people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'>Be kind to one another. Have a loving and understanding heart. Forgive one another because God has forgiven you for Christs sake.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>So try to be like God, because you are his own dear children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>Love others as Christ has loved us. He gave his life for us, a sweet smelling offering and a sacrifice to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>As Gods people, you should not even talk about wrong living, any kind of wrong sex or wanting things you cannot have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>There should be no dirty talk, no foolish talk, no funny stories with a wrong meaning.  This is not a good way to talk. But what you should do is thank God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>You know this. There are people who use sex wrongly, and who are always wanting what others have. No such a person has any place in the kingdom of Christ and of God.  He is worshipping an idol.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>Do not let anyone fool you by their empty talk. It is because people do these wrong things that God is very angry. He is angry with the people who do not obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>So then, have nothing to do with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>You were in the dark before, but now the Lord has given you light. Live like people who have the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>People who have the light do all that is good and right and true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>Learn what pleases the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>Have no part in the empty things people do in the dark. Show them that they are wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>It is a shame even to talk about the things they do in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>But when the light shines on something, it can be seen. Anything that shows up wrong ways is light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>So it is said, Wake up, you who are asleep! Rise from death. And Christ will give you light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>Take care how you live. Do not live like people who are not wise, but live like people who are wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>Make good use of time because people live in very wrong ways these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>So then, be wise and understand what the Lord wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>Do not get drunk with wine. That is living in a wrong way. But be filled with the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>Speak to one another by the songs in the holy writings, and songs of praise, and Christian songs. Sing and make a joyful noise in your hearts to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>Always thank God the Father for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>Give way to each other because you respect Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>Wives, obey your husbands as you obey the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>The husband is the head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the church people. The church is his body and he saved it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>Wives should obey their husbands in everything, just as the church people obey Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church people. He gave his life for the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>He did that so that he might make the church people holy, when they were washed with water by Gods word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>He gave his life for the church so that one day he can look at the church and see that the people are great and wonderful. The people of the church must have no dirty spot or wrinkle or any thing like that. But they are to be holy and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>So husbands should love their wives as they love their own bodies. The man who loves his wife loves himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>No one ever hated his own body. But he feeds it and takes care of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>In the same way Christ takes care of the church because we are parts of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>The holy writings say For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother. He shall be joined to his wife, and the two of them shall be like one person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>This is a wonderful plan of God. I am speaking here of the plan about Christ and the church people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>However, each one of you should love his wife as he loves himself. And the wife should respect her husband.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.6.1'>Children, obey your parents as the Lord wants you to. This is the right thing to do. 2,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.2'>Respect your father and mother. This is the first law of God with a promise: So that all will be well with you, and that you may live long on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.3'>Fathers, do not make your children angry. But teach them the things children need to know, and tell them what they must not do. Teach them what Christ would teach them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.4'>Servants, obey your boss. Respect him with all your heart and try to please him as you would Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.5'>Obey not only when he is looking at you, as if you were pleasing a man. But obey as the servants of Christ, and do with all your heart what God wants you to do.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.6.9'>Last of all, I say this. Be strong in the Lord and use the strength he gives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.10'>Use everything that God has given you so that you can fight against the tricks of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.11'>We are not fighting against people of flesh and blood. But we are fighting against rulers and powers whom we cannot see. We are fighting against those who control the darkness of this world, and against bad spirits who have power in the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.12'>So use everything that God has given you, that you can fight when the bad time comes.  You will need to do everything you can do to stand!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.13'>So then, stand and hold on tight to the truth like you put on a belt. Do what is right. Wear it as a cover for your body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.14'>You have the good news of peace. Wear that like shoes on your feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.15'>You believe in God. Take that and cover all of yourself with it. With that you can stop all the poison arrows of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.16'>You have been saved. Wear your salvation like you wear something on your head to protect yourself. And take with you the big knife or sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>He was very sick! He almost died! But God was kind to him. He was not only kind to him, but also to me. God did not let me have one trouble after another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>I want even more to send him to you so that you will be happy when you see him again.  And I will not be so troubled any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>So receive him with much joy because he is a Christian brother. Give respect to men like him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>He almost died doing the work of Christ. You wished to help me, but you could not come. He came instead. He was willing to put his life in danger in order to help me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>Now, my brothers, I say be glad for what the Lord has done for you. It is not hard for me to write the same things to you over and over. And it is good for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Watch out for those teachers who are like dogs. Watch out for those teachers who do wrong things. And watch out for those teachers who want you to have the mark of a Jew cut in your bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>We have Gods Spirit and we worship God in the Spirit. So we are the people who have the mark of God. Christ Jesus is our reason for being joyful. We do not trust in having a mark cut in our bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>And yet I could trust in things about myself if I wanted to. If any other man thinks that he has something about himself to trust in, I have more things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>I had the mark of a Jew cut in my body when I was eight days old. I was born of the people of Israel. I belong to the family of Benjamin, so I was born a true Jew. I was a Pharisee, so I obeyed the Jewish law very carefully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>I was so full of my own ideas that I sent Christians to prison. But I was a good man in the way the Jewish law calls a man good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But all these things that might have helped me, I call them all nothing, because of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>Yes, I call them all nothing, because to know Christ Jesus my Lord is much better. It is for his sake that I have given them all up and call them just dirt. I have lost them but gained Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>I do it so that I will belong to him. I do not want to be called good because of the Jewish law. But I want to be made good by believing in Christ. I want to be put right with God through faith alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>I want to know Christ. I want to know the power that raised him from death. I want to have a part in his trouble. I want to be like him in his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>Then I hope to be raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>I do not mean to say that I have got there yet, or that I am perfect yet. But I am trying hard to get there, because that is why Christ saved me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>My brothers, I do not yet think that I have got all the things of Christ. But there is one thing that I am doing. I forget what is behind me and reach out to what is ahead of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>Like a man running a race, I try hard to reach the line so that I will receive the prize.  Because we belong to Christ Jesus, God is calling us to receive this prize that he has for us in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>All of us who are grown-up Christians should feel this way. And if you do not think this way, God will show you the right way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>But no matter how far we have gone, we must keep on going that way. And let us do it together, having the same things in mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>My brothers, do as I do, all of you. Look at the people who live the way we have lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>Many people live as if they hated the cross of Christ. I have often told you about them,  and I tell you now with tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>They will be lost for ever. Their belly is the god they worship. They boast about things they should be ashamed of. They think only about things of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>But we belong to heaven. And we are waiting for the Saviour to come from heaven. He is the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>He will change our body which was made for this world. He will make it like his own wonderful body. He will do this by his power to make all things obey him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>And so, my brothers, I love you and want very much to be with you. I am very happy about you. And you are like a prize I have won in a race. My dear people, keep on standing firm and strong in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I beg Euodia and Syntyche to agree to work together. I ask them to be of the same mind in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>I beg you, my real helper, to help these women. They worked hard with me in telling the good news. Clement and my other helpers worked hard with me too. Their names are in Gods Book of Life. Always be glad for what the Lord has done. I will say it again, be glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Let everyone know that you think kindly of others before yourselves. The Lord is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Do not worry about anything. Talk to God about everything. Thank him for what you have. Ask him for what you need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>Then God will give you peace, a peace which is too wonderful to understand. That peace will keep your hearts and minds safe as you trust in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>Here, my brothers, are some things I want you to think about. Think about things that are true, honest, right, clean and pure, things that are lovely, and things that are good to talk about. If they are good, and if they bring praise to God, think about these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>I taught you, and you learned things from me. You heard the things I said, and you saw the things I did. Do these same things yourselves. Then God who gives peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>The Lord made me very happy to know that you were thinking about me again. Yes, I know you were thinking of me before, but you had no way to help me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>I do not mean that I needed it. I have learned to be satisfied with what I have. I am happy with whatever happens to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>I know how to live when I am poor, and I know how to live when I am rich. No matter how things are, I have learned how to live: when I have plenty of food, or when I am hungry; when I have more things than I need, and when I do not have enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I can do all things because Christ gives me strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>But you were kind to help me when I was in trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>You people of Philippi know this too. When I first told the good news after I left the country of Macedonia, you were the only church people who helped me. You sent me money to pay my expenses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>Even when I was in the city of Thessalonica, you sent money to help me more than once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>It is not that I want the gift. But I want you to have more and more blessing because you give.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>I have all I need and more. Yes, I have plenty because Epaphroditus gave me what you sent me. Your gift was like a sweet-smelling offering to God. It was a sacrifice which God took and it pleased him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>My God will give you everything you need. He has wonderful riches in heaven because of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>Praise God our Father for ever. Yes, he will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>Please give my greetings to every one who belongs to Christ Jesus. The Christian brothers who are with me greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>All of Gods people send greetings to you, especially the people of Caesars house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.1.1'>I am Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ. God wanted me to be an apostle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.2'>Timothy our brother, and I are writing this letter to Gods people, the Christian brothers in the city of Colossae. May the kindness of God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>We give thanks to God. He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. When we ask God to bless you, we always thank him for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>We have heard that you believe in Christ Jesus and love all of Gods people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>And also, you are looking ahead to what you will have in heaven. You have heard about it already when the good news was told to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>That message has reached you. It is doing good and it is spreading everywhere in the world. It is doing the same among you. It began the day you heard and understood Gods blessing, which came to you in a clear way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>Epaphras taught you the truth. He is Christs servant, as we are also, and we love him. He is a good worker to help you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>Also, it is he who told us of your love in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>That is why we keep on talking to God about you since the day we heard about you. We ask him that you may know everything he wants you to do. We ask him that you may be very wise and that the Spirit will help you to understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>We ask him that you will live the way the Lord wants you to live, so that you will please him in everything you do. We ask that you will do everything that is good. We ask that you will see the fruit from what you do. We ask that you will know more and more about God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>God has wonderful power. And we ask him to give you all the strength you need to go through all your troubles, to be very patient in them, and to be happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>Thank the Father who has made us ready to be with the people of God who live in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>He has set us free from the kingdom where it is dark. And he has put us into the kingdom where his dear Son rules.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>Because of his Son, we are set free and the wrong things we have done are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>The Son is like God who cannot be seen. He was his Son before anything was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>He made everything in the sky and on the earth. He made the things which can be seen and the things which cannot be seen. That means angels, kings, great powers, and rulers.  They were all made by him and for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>He himself was before all things. And he holds all things together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>He is also the head of the body which is the church &lt;FI&gt;the people who believe in Jesus Christ&lt;Fi&gt; . He is the beginning, the first one to rise from death, so that he would be the first one in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.19'>God wanted Christ to have everything in himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.20'>And God chose him to be the one who would bring all things back to himself. God made peace by the blood which Christ gave on his cross. He would bring back all things on earth and in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.21'>At one time you were far away from God. You hated him in your hearts and you did wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.22'>But now Christ himself has died on a cross, and he has brought you back to God. Christ will bring you before God holy, clean, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>But you must keep on believing and stand strong and true. Let nothing shake the hope which the good news brought you. You heard the same good news as is told to everyone in the whole world. I, Paul, was given the work of telling that same good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>And now, even though I suffer for you, I am happy. There are still some things for Christ to suffer in his body, which is the church. So I am glad to take my share of his suffering in my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>God gave me work to do for the church people so that you might know all of Gods message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>This message is about the secret plan of God. People who lived in all the past times of the world did not know about this plan. But now it has been told to Gods people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>He wanted them to know that his plan is very great and wonderful for those who are not Jews. And this plan is that Christ is in you! He is your hope for all the wonderful things that are to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>We tell about him. We tell everyone to be careful to live in the right way. We teach everyone all he needs to know. We do this so that we can bring everyone before God and he will be grown up in the things of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>And I am working for this with all the strength that God gives me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>I want you to know how much I care for you and those in the city of Laodicea, and even all those who have never seen me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>I want them to be strong and to love one another. I want them to understand everything. I want them to know in a more perfect way about Gods plan, which is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>All the wonderful things there are to know about the plan are found in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>I say this so that no one may lead you the wrong way by their fine words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>Even though I am not with you in body, I am with you in spirit. I am happy to see that you stand together well and that you keep on believing in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>You received Christ Jesus the Lord. So live in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>Let your heart be planted in him. Grow up in him. Believe with all your heart what you were taught. And be very thankful to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>Do not let anyone fool you by his wise words. They are not true. They are what men say. They are the teachings of this world and not what Christ says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>Christ has everything that God has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>And you, too, have everything when you are in him. He rules over every power and ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>In Christ you were not circumcised by mens hands. But you were circumcised in Christs way when all the wrong things you did in your bodies were taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>You were buried with Christ when you were baptised. You were also raised with him to a new life when you were baptised. You were raised because you believed in the power of God who raised Christ from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>You were dead because of the wrong things you had done, and because your lives had not been made clean. But God gave you life with Christ. He forgave you for all the wrong things you did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>He wiped out all the things that were written against us in the laws. He took the writing away and nailed it to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>He won the victory over powers and rulers. He showed that they had no power at all. He showed the world his victory through the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>So do not let anyone say you are wrong about what you eat or drink, or about a feast, or a special holy day or a Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>They are like a shadow of what is to come. But Christ is the body that makes the shadow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>Do not let anyone tell you that you are wrong and that to be humble you must worship angels. He talks about things he has not seen. He is very proud, but he has nothing to be proud of, because his thoughts come from his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>He is not joined to the real head which is Christ. It is from him that the whole body receives strength and is held together by its joints and muscles. It is from him that the body grows as God makes it grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>Did you die with Christ? Then you left the teachings of this world. So why do you obey laws as if you were still living in this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>I mean laws like this: "Do not touch that. Do not eat this. Do not put your hand on that."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>All such things are gone as soon as they are used. These are laws made and taught by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>These laws look as if they are good laws. They make a show of doing things for God.  They make people humble themselves in some way. They make people control their bodies in certain ways. But they have no power to keep people from doing all the wrong things they want to do.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>Were you raised from death with Christ? Then look for the things which are in heaven.  There Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>Think about the things that are in heaven, not about things that are on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>Your old life died with Christ and your new life is kept with Christ in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>Christ is our life. When he comes again and is seen, then you will also be seen with him.  And you will be great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>So then, put to death those things of this world which are in you. I mean these things:  wrong sex, things that are not clean, a heart that is burning to do wrong things, wanting what is wrong, and wanting to have what other people have. This last one is like worshipping an idol.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>They are things that make God angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>You used to do these things when you lived that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>But now you must stop all these: being angry, hating people, wrong feelings toward others, saying wrong things about people, and dirty talking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>Do not tell lies to one another. You have stopped being the person you used to be who did wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>And now you have become a new person. That new person is always learning more and more until he becomes like God who made him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>In this new person, there is no difference between a Greek and a Jew. There is no difference between a man who is circumcised with the mark of the Jew and a man who is not circumcised. There is no difference between a person from a friendly country or someone from a country which is not friendly. There is no difference between a slave and a person who is free. Christ is everything and is in all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>You are chosen by God. He loves you and has made you holy. So then, care for one another. Be kind. Do not be proud. Be humble. Be patient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>Be patient with one another. If any one has a complaint against another, forgive that one.  Christ forgave you. So you should forgive each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.14'>Beside all these, you must have love. This joins everything together as it should be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>Hold on to the peace of God which is in your hearts. You were called to have peace because you are all like one body. Be thankful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.16'>Let your hearts be filled with the word of Christ. Be very wise when you teach people and help them to understand what is right and wrong. Sing with music. Sing praises and Christian songs. Sing to the Lord with praise in your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.17'>Whatever you say, or whatever you do, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus. Give thanks to God the Father through Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.18'>Wives, obey your husbands. This is the right way to live when you belong to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.19'>Husbands, love your wives and do not be unkind to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.20'>Children, obey your parents in everything. This pleases the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.21'>Fathers, do not make your children angry. They might stop trying to do right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.22'>Servants, obey your boss in everything. Obey always, not only when he is looking at you as if you were pleasing a man. Do it with all your heart because you respect the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.23'>Whatever your work is, do it gladly. Do it as you would do it unto the Lord and not for people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.24'>You know you will get pay from the Lord, for you are the servants of the Lord Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.25'>The person who does wrong will be punished for the wrong he has done. God does not love one person more than another.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>We know that the law is good when anyone uses it in the right way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>He must understand that the law was not made for the man who lives right. It was made for those who do not want any laws over them, and for those who will not obey. It was made for those who do not respect God, and those who are bad people. It was made for those who do not respect anything that is holy or belongs to God. It was made for those who beat their fathers or mothers, and for those who kill people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>It was made for those who use sex in the wrong way and for men who have sex with other men. It was made for those who steal people, for those who tell lies, for those who make a promise that is not true, and for any other thing that is not right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>The wonderful good news of God teaches what is right. Praise him! And he has trusted me to tell this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who gave me power to tell the good news. I thank him because he believed he could trust me, and he chose me for this work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>There was a time when I did not respect him. I troubled his people. I said wrong things about him. But he was very kind to me, because I did not know what I was doing and I did not believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>Our Lord showed me much love and kindness. I believed in him and had the love which comes from Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>These are true words and everyone should believe them. Christ Jesus came into the world to save bad people. And I am the worst of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>Jesus Christ wanted to show that he is very, very patient. And so he was kind to me who was the worst. He did this so that others would believe in him and live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>Give honour and praise for ever and ever to the one who is King for ever. He will never die. He cannot be seen. He is the only God. Yes, he is!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>My son Timothy, here is what I tell you to do. And it is what the prophets said about you before. Remember their words, and fight like a good soldier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>Keep on believing. Do only what you know is right. Some people have not done that and they have stopped believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>Hymenaeus and Alexander are among them. I have given them to Satan so that they will be punished and learn not to teach things that do not respect God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>First of all, I want Gods people to do this. They must talk to God for all the people. They must ask God to help them. They must ask God to give them what they need. They must thank God for all that he gives them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>They must talk to God for all the kings and all rulers. They must do this so that we may live in peace and quiet, so that we may please God and do what is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>This is a good thing. And God, our Saviour, is pleased when people do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>He wants all people to be saved and to know what is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>There is one God. There is also one man who can open the way between God and all people. That man is Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>He gave his life to set all men free. This matter was told at the right time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>I was chosen to tell about this and to be an apostle. I am telling the truth. I am not lying. I was chosen to teach people who are not Jews. I must teach them to believe and to know what is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>So I want men in every place to talk to God. They must have clean lives when they lift up their hands to talk to God. They must not be angry. They must have faith in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>I also want women to wear the right kind of clothes. They should not make a show of themselves, but use good sense. They should not fix up their hair in a fancy way, or wear gold and fine stones, or clothes that cost much money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>But women should busy themselves with good works. This is the right thing for women who say they worship God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>A woman must learn quietly and be very humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>I do not allow any woman to teach or to rule over a man. She must remain quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>Adam was not fooled. But the woman was fooled and did wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>But anyway, the women will come safely through the time of delivering a child, if they keep on believing and loving God, and if they live a clean life and keep humble.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>These are true words. If a man wants to be a leader of the church people, he seeks a good thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>For a man to be a church leader, people must speak well of him. He must have only one wife. He must be able to control himself. He must use good sense. He must behave himself well. He must be kind to strangers in his house. He must be a good teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>He must not get drunk. He must not fight. But he must be kind. He must not quarrel. He must not love money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>He must be a good leader for his own family. His children must obey him and respect him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>If a man does not know how to lead his own family, how can he take care of the church of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>A church leader must not be a new believer. If he were a new believer, he might become proud and set himself up like the devil did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>People who are not church people must also speak well of a church leader, so that he will not fall into the devils trap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>In the same way, the leaders helpers must be men whom people respect. They must not say one thing one time and something different another time. They must not drink too much wine. They must not try to get rich in wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>They must know Gods plan and what we believe. They must do only what they know is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>Try these men first. Then let them help the church people if they have done nothing wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>In the same way, their wives must be women whom people respect. They must not tell lies about anyone. They must be able to control themselves. They must live so that people can trust them in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>The leaders helpers must have only one wife. They must be good leaders for their children and family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>When they have done the work of a helper well, people will respect them. If they do well,  they will not fear to tell what they believe about Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>I am writing to you about these matters even though I hope to come to you soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>Then if I do not come right away, you will know what people should do in Gods family.  This family is the church of the living God. The church people hold what is true and keeps it strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>Gods plan is very great as we all know. Here it is: we saw God as a man; Gods Spirit proved he was right; angels saw him; the nations were told about him; people of the world believed in him; God took him up into heaven.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>The Spirit of God says very plainly that in later times some people will stop believing.  They will listen to other spirits that fool them, and to the teaching of bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>Men will tell lies and make people believe they are something when they are not. These men will have made their hearts so hard that they will not know they are doing wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>They will teach people that they should not marry. They will teach them not to eat some kinds of food. God made the food and he wanted people to take it and thank him for it.  Those who believe and know what is true do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>Everything that God has made for food is good. It is all right to eat it if people thank God for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>Gods word and asking him to bless the food makes it good for people to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>Tell the Christian brothers and sisters these things and you will do the work of Christ Jesus well. Your own heart will be fed by the things you have believed and the good teaching you have followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>Have nothing to do with foolish stories. Make yourself strong in the things that please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>To make the body strong helps a little, but the things of God help us in all ways. The things of God promise us life now and life in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>These are true words and everyone should believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>That is why we work hard and put up with troubles. We trust in the living God who came to save all people. He makes a way for those who believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>Tell people these things and teach them to do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>Do not let anyone despise you because you are a young man. Show those who believe how they should live. Show them by the way you talk. Show them by the way you live.  Show them by the way you love. Show them how to believe by the way you believe.  Show them how to live a clean life by the way you live a clean life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>Until I come, read the holy writings to people. Talk to them and teach them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Use the gift you have. It was given to you when the church leaders put their hands on your head and gave you a message from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>Take time to think about these things. Then everybody will see how well you are going ahead in your work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>Take care of yourself and what you teach. Keep on doing this. If you do, you will save yourself and those who listen to you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>Do not be angry with an older man if he has done something wrong, but talk kindly to him as you would talk to your father. Talk to the young men like brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>Talk to the older women like mothers. Talk to the young women like sisters. And be sure to keep a clean mind and heart in all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>Help widow women, whose husbands are dead, if they have no one to help them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>If they have children or grandchildren, they should learn that the first place to do Gods work is in the home to help their own family. They should help their parents because their parents have helped them. This will please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>A widow who has no one to help her, and is alone, trusts in God. Day and night she talks to God and asks him for the things she needs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>But a woman who spends her time in pleasing herself is really dead, even while she still lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>Tell them these things so that they will do what is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>A man must care for his own people. At least he must care for his family. If he does not care for them, he shows that he does not believe in God. He is worse than one who has never believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>A widow who is over sixty years old, may be chosen to help the church people. But she must have been the wife of one husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>People must speak well of the good works she has done. Has she brought up children?  Has she been kind to strangers and cared for them in her house? Has she washed the feet of Gods people? Has she helped people who were in trouble? Has she done every kind of good thing to help people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>But do not choose young women. When they begin to love other things more than Christ,  they will want to marry again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>And that will be wrong for them because they have not kept their first promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>Not only that, but they also become lazy. They walk about going from house to house.  Not only are they lazy but they talk too much and tell stories about people. They tell things they should not tell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>So I would like young women to marry again and have children. They should care for their homes. They should do nothing that would make the enemy say wrong things about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>Some have already turned away to follow Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>Do any Christians have in their families women whose husbands are dead? If they do,  they should help them. The church people should not have to care for them. Then the church can help the women who have no one to help them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>The leaders of the church people who rule well should be given greater honour and reward. At least do this for those who work hard in speaking and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>The holy writings say, You may not tie the mouth of a cow when it is walking on the grain to beat it out. And also, The man who works should be paid for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Do not listen to a complaint against a leader if what he has done has not been seen and proved by two or three people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>Talk to those who live a wrong life and tell them to stop it. Talk to them in front of all the church members. Then the others will be afraid to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>I say this before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels of God. Do these things in an honest way. Do not treat one person better than another person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>Do not be in a hurry to place your hands on a man as a sign for him to be a leader. Do not take part in the wrong things another man does. Keep yourself clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>Do not drink water only. But drink a little wine to help your stomach because you are sick so often.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>The wrong things some men do can be seen clearly and show that they should be punished. But wrong things other people do are not seen until later.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>So also, the good things are seen clearly. Even when they are not seen at first, they will be seen later.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>Servants should respect their bosses in every way. Then people will not say wrong things about Gods name and what we teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>Those who work for Christian masters should not take life easy just because the person they work for is a Christian. They should work all the better because they are loved by them. Teach these things and tell people to do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>Is there anyone who teaches something different? Or is there anyone who does not agree with the true words of our Lord Jesus Christ? Or does he not agree with teaching about the things of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>If there is such a person, he is full of pride. He knows nothing. He wants to quarrel and talk about words. Such things make people jealous of each other. They think wrong thoughts about each other which are not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>They quarrel. The minds of these men are bad. They do not know what is true. They think that worshipping God makes people rich. Keep away from such people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>It is true that people are much better off if they live to please God and if they are satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>When we were born, we brought nothing into this world, and when we die, we can take nothing out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>If we have food and clothes, that should be enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>People who want to be rich have trouble. They get caught in a trap. They want many foolish things which are wrong for them. Because of this, men are lost and punished for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>Because people love money they do all kinds of wrong things. Some people have stopped believing in God because they want money so much. And it brings them many troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>But you belong to God, Timothy. Have nothing to do with all this. But do what is right.  Do what God wants you to do. Believe in Christ. Be loving. Be patient. Be kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>Work hard at believing in God more and more. Make sure that you get everlasting life;  God called you to have it. You stood before many people and said that you believed in Christ. That was the right thing to say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>Now we stand before God who gives life to all things. We stand before Christ who said what was right when he was in court before Pontius Pilate. I tell you to do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>Do what you have been told to do. And do it so there will be nothing wrong, until our Lord Jesus Christ comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>At the right time God will bring Christ back. Praise God! He alone is ruler. He is King over all kings, and Lord over all lords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>He alone has everlasting life. He lives in such light that no one can go near him. No person has ever seen him, or can see him. May he have honour and respect and have everlasting power. May it be so!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>Tell the rich people in this world not to be proud. Tell them to trust in God not in short-lived riches. He gives us richly all things to make us happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>Tell the rich people to do good. Tell them to do many good things. Tell them to give to other people, and to help those who are in need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>In this way they will store up good things for themselves for the time to come. Then they will get that life which really is the true life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>Timothy, take good care of what has been given to you. Some teachers say they know many things, but these things are not true. Do not teach these foolish things that do not come from God. Do not teach these things that do not agree together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>Some men have believed these things and have stopped believing in Christ. May God bless all of you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>God saved us and called us to live a holy life. He did not do it because of the good things we have done. He did it because he himself planned to do it, and wanted to do it. That was the blessing he gave us in Christ Jesus. He had this plan before he made the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>But now he has made it real through the coming of Jesus Christ who saves. He has put death out of the way. He has shown people can have everlasting life by telling them the good news.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>God also proved that it was the true way. He gave signs. He did things that surprised people. He did many things by his power. He gave the gifts of the Holy Spirit to people just as he wanted to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>God did not put the next world under angels for them to rule over. That is the world we are talking about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>In one place the holy writings say, What is man and why do you think about him? What is the Son of a Man and why do you care about him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>You made him lower than angels for a little while. But then you made him very great and high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>You put everything under him for him to rule over. When God gave him the right to rule over everything, nothing was left out which he did not have the right to rule. But we do not yet see him ruling over everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>But we do see Jesus! For a short time he was lower than the angels. Because he died, we see him made great and high. He did this so that he could die for every person. God is so good!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>Everything was made for God and by God. It seemed good to him that Jesus life should be made complete, by going through the hard things that happened to him. This was because Jesus leads many people to heaven as Gods children. And he is the one who saves them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>Jesus, who makes people holy, and those who are made holy, all have one Father in heaven. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>He said, I will tell my brothers about you. I will sing praise about you among those who gather together for worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>He also said, I will trust God. And again, Here am I and the children God has given to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Gods children all have a body. That is why Jesus himself had the same. But because Jesus also had a body, he was able to die and stop the devil. The devil has power to make people die. But Jesus, by his own death, was able to stop the power of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>People were afraid to die. All their lives they were like slaves. When Jesus died, he was able to set them free from their fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>Jesus did not come to help angels. He came to help people who were born in Abrahams family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>So he had to be made like his brothers in every way. Then he could be a high priest to make a way to God for them, a priest who was kind and true. He could make it possible for God to forgive people for the wrong things they had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>He had a very hard time when he was tested. But because he was tested, he is able to help people who are tested.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>My brothers, you are holy. You are also called to go to heaven. Take time to think carefully about Jesus. God sent him. He is the high priest we believe in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>He did what God sent him to do, just as Moses did in Gods house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>But Jesus is much greater than Moses-as the one who builds a house is greater than the house itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>Every house is built by someone, but God is the one who builds all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>Moses did what he was told to do as a servant in all of Gods house. He showed things that God would say later.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>But Jesus Christ was true as a Son over Gods house. We are Gods house if we keep on believing and telling others what we hope to have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>So as the Holy Spirit says, Today, when you hear me speak, do not make your hearts hard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>That is what happened when the people tested me in the desert and I became angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>There your fathers tested me and tried me. And they saw what I did for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>So I was very angry with the people of that time. I said, "Their minds are always dark.  They have not known my ways."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>I said when I was angry, "They will never go into my resting place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>My brothers, take care that not one of you has a heart that does not believe. Such a heart will take you away from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>But talk to each other every day while Today lasts, so that wrong ways will not fool any one of you and your hearts become hard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>We have our part with Christ if we go on to the end and believe in him as we did at first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>God is still saying now, Today, when you hear me speak, do not make your hearts hard.  That is what happened when the people turned against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>Who were the people who heard him and yet made him very angry? It was all the people whom Moses led out of the country of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>With whom was God angry for forty years? He was angry with the people who had done wrong. And they died in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>Who were the people God said would never go into his resting place? They were the people who would not listen to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>So then, we see that they could not go in because they did not believe him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>We still have Gods promise that people will go into his resting place. So let us take care that not one of you will be kept out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>The good news has been told to us just as it was told to the people in the desert. But the message which they heard did not do them any good. Even though they heard it, they did not believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>But we who believe, will go into that resting place of God. It is as God said, When I was angry, I said, "They will never go into my resting place." He said this even though his work had been finished ever since he had made the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>Here is what he said, somewhere in the holy writings, about the seventh day: And God rested on the seventh day after doing all his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>And now here he says again, They will never go into my resting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>So that means some people will go in. But the people who first heard the good news about it did not go in. They did not believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>So he chose another day called Today. He spoke through David many years later, who said, Today, when you hear his voice, do not make your hearts hard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>If Joshua had led those people to rest, God would not have talked later about another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>So there is still a rest for Gods people, like a Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>The person who goes into Gods resting place will rest after doing his work, just as God rested after doing his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>So let us do our best to go into that resting place. Those people died in the wilderness because they did not believe. So let us take care that the same thing does not happen to one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>Gods word is living and full of power. It is more sharp than any sword that cuts on both sides. What God says cuts through and divides the mind and spirit. It cuts through and divides the place where the bones are joined, and the part inside the bone. What God says is able to judge the things people think and plan in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>God is the one we must meet. Nothing can be hidden from him. Everything is open and he can see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>We have a great high priest who has gone into heaven. He is Jesus, the Son of God.  Because we have such a great high priest, let us hold on to the things we believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>We have a high priest who can feel with us when we are weak. He has been tested in every way, just as we are. But he did not do anything wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>So let us trust him when we come to worship God. He is so good. He will be kind to us and help us when we need it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>Every high priest is chosen from among men. His work is to stand before God for people.  He brings gifts and makes sacrifices to God for the wrong things people have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>Such a high priest can be kind to people who do not know what is right and who do wrong. He knows how to share in the suffering of others because he himself is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>Because he is weak himself, he must make sacrifices to God for the wrong things he has done, just as he does for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>No one chooses himself to be high priest. But God calls him, just as he called Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>So Christ did not choose himself to be a high priest. But he was chosen by the One who said to him, You are my Son, and I am your Father today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>In another place in the holy writings God said, You are a priest for ever like Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>When Jesus was a man, he talked to God who was able to save him from death. He called loudly to him with tears. God heard him because he honoured and respected God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>Even though Jesus was his Son, he learned to obey God in the troubles he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>When he became perfect, he saved for ever all who obeyed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>God called him a high priest like Melchizedek was a priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>We have many things to say about him. But they are hard to explain to you. You are so slow to understand what we tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>By this time you should be able to teach others. But you need someone to teach you Gods word again from the very beginning. Like children, you need milk, not meat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>Anyone who takes milk does not understand the message about which things are right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But meat is for people who are grown up. It is for people who have trained their minds to know the difference between what is good and what is bad.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>So, let us leave behind the first teachings about Christ. And let us go on to things that are grown up. We must not go back to the beginning again and talk about turning away from doing things that bring death to us. We must not go back again and talk about believing in God. Let us go forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>We must not go back to teaching about baptizing people in water, about putting hands on peoples heads, about people being raised from death, and about people being judged for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>If God will let us, we will go on to build on these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>Some people had light in their hearts once. They knew the gift from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>They had the Holy Spirit. They knew the word of God is good and felt the powers of the next world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>If people who were like that leave their faith in Christ, they cannot come to God again.  They themselves nail Gods Son up on the cross again. They are holding him up to shame before everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>The ground drinks the water that often rains on it. It makes plants grow for the people who take care of it. And God blesses that ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>But if it grows thorns and weeds, it is no good. It will soon be cursed. In the end, it will be burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>This is the way we talk. But dear people, we are sure that better things are true about you. Yes, you show all the good ways of people who have been saved from their wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>God does what is right. He will not forget your work and the love you have shown for him. You have helped Gods people and you are still helping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>We want every one of you to try in the same way. Then you will get what you hope for right up to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>Do not give up. But be like the people who get what God has promised. They believe God and keep on believing for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>God made a promise to Abraham. God did not have anyone greater than himself to hear his promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>So he promised to himself when he said, I will surely bless you and you will have many children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>Abraham kept on believing God. And so he got what God had promised him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>When men make a promise, they ask someone to hear it who is greater than they are.  When someone great has heard a promise, it stops any quarrel about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>God made a promise to people. He wanted to show them that he would surely do as he said. So he promised to himself to keep the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>These two things cannot be changed and God cannot lie about them. So we can trust him.  We have run to him to get what he has promised us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>This promise gives our hearts something to hold on to. It keeps our hearts strong and steady. It will take us into the Holy Place right inside Gods house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>Jesus has gone there ahead of us. He has been made high priest for ever like Melchizedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>Melchizedek was king of the city of Salem. He was a priest of God who is the greatest of all. Melchizedek met Abraham when Abraham came back from killing some bad kings.  And Melchizedek blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>Abraham divided all that he took away from the kings into ten parts. He gave Melchizedek one part. First, the name Melchizedek means the king who is true and right with God. Then he was king of Salem. That means king of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>He has no father or mother. The names of the family from which he comes are not written down. It is not written down that he was born or that he died. But, like the Son of God, he stays on being a priest for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>Just think how great he was! Even Abraham, the father of our people, gave him a tenth,  one part out of ten, of all he brought back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>The sons of Levi, who are priests, have the right by law to take a tenth of what the people have. These people are their own brothers. They also are Abrahams children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But Melchizedek was not from Levis family. Yet he took a tenth of what Abraham had.  And he blessed Abraham, to whom God made the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>Everyone knows this is true. The person who is blessed is not so great as the person who blesses him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>Here, priests take their tenth, but they are people who will die one day. But Melchizedek,  who took his tenth, never dies. The holy writings say it is so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>And we say that Levi, the priest who takes the tenth from the people, gave his tenth through Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>He was not yet born when Melchizedek met Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>It was while the sons of Levi were priests that the law was made for the people. If those priests were good enough, why would another priest need to come who was like Melchizedek? Why would he not be like Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>If the kind of priest is changed, then the law must be changed also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>The one we are talking about belonged to another tribe. No man from his tribe ever made sacrifices in Gods house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>Everyone knows that our Lord Jesus came from the tribe of Judah. And Moses never said anything about priests coming from that tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>You can understand it even better when another priest comes who is like Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>He was not made a priest by law. The law said that the priest must come from a certain tribe. But he was made a priest because he has power to live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>This is what the holy writings say about him, You are a priest for ever, like Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>The old law given to Moses by God was put away. It was weak and no good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>The law did not make anything right. But something better has been brought to us. It is Gods promise. And by that promise we come near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>Also Christ was not made a priest without Gods strong promise. The others were made priests without Gods strong promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>But this man was made priest by Gods strong promise. God said to him, The Lord has made a strong promise, and he will not change it. "You are a priest for ever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>Also because of this, Jesus makes a better agreement with God for people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>The other priests were many, because they died and could not go on with their work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>But because Jesus lives forever, he is a priest for ever and no one takes his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Because of that, he is able to save people for ever, if they come to God by him. He lives for ever to talk to God for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>We needed such a high priest as he is. He is holy. He is good. He has never done any wrong. He has been taken away from among bad people, and taken up higher than the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>He does not need to make sacrifices every day. The other high priests make sacrifices every day, first for the wrong things they have done, and then for the people. He did it once when he offered himself as the sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>The law makes men high priests, and they are weak. But the word of Gods promise came after the law. It makes his Son high priest for ever, and he is all right.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>The real point of what we are saying is this. We now have a high priest who sits beside Gods throne or chief chair in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>He is priest in the true holy place where God lives. The Lord made that place, man did not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>Every high priest is chosen to offer gifts and sacrifices. So this high priest must have something to offer also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>If he were still on earth, he would not be a priest. There are priests on earth already who offer gifts the way the law says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>The work they do shows what the work of the priest in heaven is. When Moses made a house for God, here is what God told him to do. He said, Be sure you make everything like I showed you on the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But Christ has been given a much better work, because he is the man who is between God and men in making an agreement. This is a much better agreement. It was made by better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>If the first agreement had been all right, there would have been no need to make another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>When the people had done wrong, Gods words to them were, The days will come, the Lord says, when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>It will not be like the agreement that I made with their fathers. I made that agreement the day I led them by the hand out of the country of Egypt. But they did not keep their part of my agreement, so I left them alone, the Lord says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>After those days, the Lord says, I will make an agreement with the people of Israel. This is my agreement. I will put my laws in their minds. I will write them in their hearts. I will be their God and they will be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>A man will not need to teach another man, or his brother. He will not say, "Know the Lord," because everyone from the youngest to the oldest will know me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>I will be kind even when they do what is not right, and I will never remember the wrong things they do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>God says this is a new agreement, and that makes the first one old. When a thing is old and no good, it is about ready to be thrown away.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>The first agreement had laws about worship. And it had a holy place on earth where the agreement was kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>A house was made. In the first part of the house were the light, the table, and the bread of God. This first part was called the Holy Place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>The next part of the house was called the Most Holy Place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>In the Most Holy Place was a pan made of gold. In this pan a fire could burn to make a sweet-smelling smoke. The box of the agreement was also in the Most Holy Place. It was covered all over with gold. In this box were: the golden pot, which had some of the food God sent from heaven for the people in the desert; Aarons stick which grew flowers on it; and the stones which had Gods agreement written on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>On top of the box were the shapes of two angels. They showed that God is great. Their wings spread over the cover of the box. It was the place where God showed that he is kind. But we cannot take time to tell about every part of these things now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>These things were made ready. The priests always went into the first part of the house to do their work for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>But only the high priest went into the second part. And he went in only once a year. He never went in without taking blood with him. He gave the blood to God for the wrong things he had done and for the wrong things people had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>This is how the Holy Spirit showed that the way into the Most Holy Place was not yet open to everybody. It was not open as long as the first house was still standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>This first part is a picture of the time we are in now. In it gifts and sacrifices are made to God. But they cannot make a persons heart clean to worship God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>These are only things to eat and drink and different kinds of washings. They are laws made for the body until the time when everything is made right again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But Christ has come as the high priest of the good things which have come. He went through a greater and better house which was not made by mens hands. It is not a part of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>He did not take the blood of goats and young cows. He took his own blood. And he went into the Most Holy Place just once. He paid for our sins and made us free for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>The priest takes the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes from a young cow that has been burned. He puts this on the people who have done wrong things. This makes their bodies clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>If the blood of animals can do that, then the blood of Christ will clean our hearts much better. Christ gave himself to God as the sacrifice. He did this by the Spirit who lives for ever. He was a perfect sacrifice. He will clean our hearts from useless acts of worship.  Then we can serve the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>That is why he is the middle man of a new agreement. He died and paid for the wrong things that were done under the first agreement. Because he is a middle man, those people who are called by God can have what he promised. This will belong to them for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>A person can say who will get his things when he dies. He writes this agreement down.  Before anyone can have them, it must be proved that the person has died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>The agreement has no power until the one who made it has died. It has no power as long as the one who made it is living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>So even the old agreement made by God was not begun without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>Moses told all the people every part of the law. Then he took the blood of young cows and goats. He put some of the blood on the book of the law itself and on all the people.  He took water and red wool and a plant called hyssop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>As he did this, he said, This is the blood for the agreement which God has made for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>In the same way, he put some of the blood on the house he had made for God, and on all the things that were used in worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>Yes, by the old law almost everything is made clean with blood. If no animal is killed to give blood, then there is no way for people to be forgiven for the wrong things they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>These things on earth show in a little way what things in heaven are like. The things on earth had to be cleaned by the blood of animals. But the things in heaven had to be cleaned with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>Christ did not go into a holy place made by mens hands. The holy places on earth only show in a little way what the true holy place in heaven is like. He went into heaven itself.  Now he stands before God for our sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Christ did not have to offer himself as a sacrifice many times. He is not like the high priest who went into the Holy Place every year and took blood that was not his own blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>If Christ were like him, he would have had to die many times ever since the world was first made. But as it is now, Christ came once in the last days of the world. He came to clean away what is wrong by giving himself as a sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>People must die, and after that they will be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>So Christ gave himself as a sacrifice only once. He took on himself the wrong things many people have done. He will come a second time. But he will not come to do anything about the wrong things people have done. He will come to save those who are looking and waiting for him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>The law can show only a little about the good things that are coming. It cannot show the good things themselves. People come to worship God. But the law can never make them all right by the same sacrifices that are brought every year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>If the law could make people all right, they would stop making sacrifices. The people who come to worship would be made clean for all time, and they would not remember the wrong things they had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But, by making these sacrifices, they show that they do remember the wrong things they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>The blood of bulls and goats can never clean wrong things from peoples hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>That is why Christ said when he came into the world, You did not want sacrifices and gifts. But you made a body for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>Animals that are burned for sacrifices, and animals killed to clean away the wrong things that people do, did not satisfy you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then I said, "See, I have come to do what you, God, want me to do." This is what is written about me in the book of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>First he said, You did not want sacrifices and gifts, and animals that are given to be burned as sacrifices, and animals killed to clean away peoples wrong ways. You did not like them. These sacrifices are made to obey the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>Then he said, See, I have come to do what you want me to do. He took away the first kind of sacrifices so that the second kind would remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>God wanted us to be made holy. We have been made holy by Jesus Christ. He made us holy by once making his body a sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>Every priest stands day after day doing his work. He makes the same sacrifices many times. But these sacrifices can never clean away the wrong things people have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But Christ made one sacrifice to clean away their wrong ways for ever. Then he sat down beside God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>Since then, he is waiting till his enemies are put under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>By one sacrifice Christ has made right for ever all those people who are being made holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>The Holy Spirit tells us about this also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>First he said, This is the agreement that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts. I will write them in their minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>Then he also said, I will never remember the wrong things they have done and the times they did not obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>When these wrong things have been forgiven, a sacrifice is not needed for them again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>So, my brothers, we can go into the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>He made a new and living way for us. He opened up Gods way specially for us. It lets us through the big curtain or cloth which hides God from us. This happened when Jesus gave his body as a sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>Also, we have a high priest who has charge of Gods people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>So let us come to him with a true heart. Let us come because we believe all these things.  Let us come with our hearts washed clean from our wrong ways. Let us come with our bodies washed with clean water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>We must hold on to Gods promise that we have said we believed. And we must never let go. He has promised and he will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>Let us think of one another and help one another to love and to do good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>Do not stop going to church meetings. Some people do stop. But help each other to be strong. You must do it all the more as you see the Great Day coming closer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>Do we go on doing what is wrong after we know the truth? If we do, then there is no sacrifice any more for the wrong things we do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>But we will be judged, and that makes us fear. Gods anger will be like a very hot fire that will burn up those who are against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>Any man who broke the law of Moses was killed, if two or three people proved that he had broken the law. He will not be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>But the person who should have much bigger punishment is the one who turns against the Son of God. That person was made holy by the blood of the new agreement and then calls it nothing. He no longer honours and respects the Spirit who has been so kind to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>We know God who has said, I am the one who will punish people. I will repay them.  Also, The Lord will judge his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>People should fear very much to be punished by the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>Remember the first days when you had the light of Gods truth. In those days you were strong, even though you had to fight against many troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>Sometimes it was because people said and did wrong things to you and everybody saw it.  And sometimes it was because you stood with others who had wrong things done to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>You shared in the troubles of those who were in prison. When your things were taken from you, you were happy. You knew that you had better things in heaven, things that would always belong to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>So do not stop believing God now. Your faith will bring you much reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>You must not give up believing. Then you will do what God wants you to do. Then you will get what he promised you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>The holy writings say In a little while, the one who is to come will come. He will not wait any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>If a person does what is right because he believes in God, he will live. If he turns back, I will not be pleased with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'>We are not the people who turn back and so are lost. But we are people who believe, and so we are saved.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>If people believe God, then they know they have the things they hope to get. It is the proof of things we do not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>There were people long ago believed God. He said they were good because they believed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>We believe in God, so that is how we know that God made the world by his word. The things we see were made out of things that cannot be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>Because Abel believed God, he made a sacrifice that pleased God more than the one Cain made. Because Abel believed God, God showed that he was good. God was pleased with his gifts. Abel died. But because he believed God, he still speaks to us through his faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>Because Enoch believed God, he was taken up into heaven without dying. The people could not find him because God had taken him. Before he was taken up, the holy writings say that he pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>If a person does not believe God, he cannot please him. Anyone who comes to God must believe that God is real. And he must believe that God will bless those who try to find him. God will reward a person, if he really tries to find God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>God told Noah about things that would happen. These things had never happened before.  Noah believed God; he respected God. He built a big house on a boat, and so his family was saved &lt;FI&gt;from the big flood&lt;Fi&gt; . By believing God he showed that the other people were wrong. He was put right with God because he believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>God called Abraham to go away to a place which he would have as his own. Because Abraham believed God, he obeyed him. He went even though he did not know where he was to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'>Because he believed God, he lived like a stranger in the land God promised him. He lived in tents with Isaac and Jacob. They had the same promise he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'>Abraham was looking for a city which will last for ever. It was the city God planned and made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'>Sarah also believed God, and she was able to have a baby even though she was too old to have children. But she trusted God to do what he had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'>Abraham was too old to be a father, but a great nation was born from that one man.  They are as many as the stars in the sky and as the sands on the seaside. No man can count them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.13'>These people all died still believing God. They did not get the things God had promised them. But they saw them far away and were glad to see them. They said they did not belong to this world, but were only travelling in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'>People who say such things mean they are looking for a country which will be their own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.15'>If they had wanted the country they left behind, they could have gone back to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.16'>But now they want a better country. They want a place in heaven. That is why God wants to be called their God. He has made a city ready for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.17'>Abraham believed God when he was tested. The test was to give Isaac as a sacrifice.  Abraham gave up his only son, even though God had made a promise to him about Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.18'>God had said to Abraham, Isaacs children will be called your family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.19'>Abraham said in his heart that God could bring Isaac back to life. And so it was just as if he did get his son back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.20'>Isaac believed God. He gave Jacob and Esau blessings that were to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.21'>Jacob believed God. When he was dying, he blessed Josephs two sons. He leaned on his walking stick as he worshipped God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.22'>Joseph believed God. When he died, he remembered Gods promise and talked about the time the people of Israel would leave Egypt. He told them what to do with his bones when they left Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.23'>The father and mother of Moses believed God. When he was born, they hid him for three months because they saw that he was a very nice baby. They were not afraid of the kings orders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.24'>Moses believed God. When he was grown up, he did not want to be called the son of Pharaohs daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.25'>He chose to have troubles along with Gods people. He thought that was better than the fun which he could have living a wrong life. The fun would last only for a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.26'>He thought it was better to take shame, as Christ did, than to be a rich man in Egypt. He was looking for Gods blessings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.27'>He believed God and left Egypt. He was not afraid of the kings anger. He was strong because he saw the one who cannot be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.28'>He believed God and obeyed his law about the Passover Feast, and put blood on the door posts. He did this so that the angel who killed the oldest sons of the Egyptians, would pass over. Then he would not kill the oldest sons in the families of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.29'>The people believed God and went through the Red Sea on dry land. When the people of Egypt tried to do that, they were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.30'>The people believed God and walked around the walls of the city of Jericho for seven days. The walls fell down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.31'>Rahab was a woman who used her body wrongly for sex to get money. But she believed in God, so she did not die with the people who did not believe in God. This was when the men came to spy out her country. She took them into her house in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.32'>What more should I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson,  Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.33'>Men believed God and were able to win over other nations. They made people do what was right. They got what God promised them. They were not eaten by lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.34'>The big, hot fire did not burn them. They got away from men who wanted to kill them with long knives or swords. They were weak, but they became strong. They became very strong to fight. They drove away the armies of their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.35'>Women had children who died and were raised to life again. Some people allowed themselves to be beaten to death. They would not go free because they wanted to rise again to a better life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.36'>Others were laughed at and beaten very hard. They were even tied with chains and put into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.37'>They were killed with stones. They were tested. They were cut in pieces. They were killed with swords. They walked about wearing skins of sheep and goats. They were very poor. They were treated very badly. They were punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.38'>They were really too good to be in this world. They walked about in the desert and in the mountains, and in the holes in the hills and in the holes among the rocks on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.39'>All of these people had good things said about them because they believed God. But they did not get what God had promised.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.12.2'>We must keep our eyes on Jesus. He believed from first to last. What was put in front of him made him glad, so he did not give up when the people nailed him on a cross. He did not care about the shame. And now he is sitting beside God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jas.1.1'>I am James. I am a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. I send greetings to all of Gods people wherever they live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.2'>My brothers, be very happy when you are tested by having troubles of many kinds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.3'>You know this, that when you prove you believe, you become stronger to take troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.4'>But you must keep on being strong to take trouble. Then you will be all right in every way. You will not need anything more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.5'>If any of you need to be wise, ask God to make you wise. He gives plenty of wisdom to all people. He is not angry because you ask him. He will make you wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.6'>But when you ask, you must believe that God will do it. You must not doubt and think,  Perhaps God will not do it. A person who doubts is like a wave on the sea. The wind drives it this way and that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.7'>That person must not think that he will get anything from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.8'>A person like that has two minds. He cannot go straight in any of his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.9'>A Christian brother who is poor should be glad: he is in a high place now he is a Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.10'>A Christian brother who is rich should be glad: he is in a low place now he is a Christian.  A rich man will pass away like a flower on the grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.11'>The sun shines and is very hot. Then the grass dries and its flower falls off. It was nice at first, but now it is not nice any more. In the same way, the rich man will die while he is going around trying to make money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.12'>God will bless any man who is strong to take his trouble, when he is being tested. When he has proved he is strong, he will live for ever. That is what the Lord has promised to those who love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.13'>No one who wants to do something wrong should say, God is trying to make me do this wrong thing. God cannot do anything wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.14'>It is their own heart which is wrong. That is why he wants to do something wrong. It fools him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.15'>Then the wrong in his heart makes him do the wrong thing. And the wrong thing he has done leads to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.16'>My dear brothers, do not fool yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.17'>Every good thing and every fine gift comes from heaven. It comes from the Father of all light. He does not change and he makes no shadow by turning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.18'>He made us his children because he wanted us. He made us his children by giving us his true word. He made us his children so that we would be the first and best of all he made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.19'>My dear brothers, do not forget this. Every man should be quick to listen, slow to speak,  and slow to be angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.20'>When a man is angry, he does not do what God says is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.21'>So stop all your dirty living. Stop doing so many wrong things. Listen quietly to the word that has been put in your hearts. It is able to save you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.22'>But obey Gods word. Do not just listen to it. If you just listen to it, you fool yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.23'>Anyone who just listens to the word, and does not obey it, is like a man who looks at his face in a looking glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.24'>He looks at himself and goes away, and right away he forgets what he looked like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.25'>But there is a law that is all right. It sets people free from their old ways. Anyone who looks into that law and remembers it, is happy because he obeys the law. He does not just listen to the law and forget it, but he obeys what the law says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.26'>Some of you think that you are doing what God wants. But you are not careful what you say. If you are like that, you are fooling yourself. And you are not doing what God wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.27'>This is what God the Father wants. It is clean and right. Go and help those who have no father and mother. Go and help widow women whose husbands are dead. These people have troubles. And keep yourself clean from the wrong things in the world.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jas.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.1'>My brothers, you believe in our Lord, the wonderful Jesus Christ. So you must not think one man is better than another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.2'>A man comes in to your church meeting. He has a gold ring and wears fine clothes. A poor man also comes in. He wears old clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.3'>You look at the man who wears fine clothes. And you say to him, Sit here on this good chair. But you say to the poor man, Stand over there, or you say, Sit on the floor by my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.4'>If you do these things, you think some people are better than others. You are wrong when you judge people this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'>Listen, my dear brothers. God has chosen people who are poor in this world. They believe very much. They will have a place in the kingdom which he has promised to give to those who love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.6'>But you made the poor man ashamed. Is it not the rich people who trouble you? Are not they the ones who take you to court?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.7'>Are not they the ones who say wrong things about the good name you have?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.8'>The holy writings say, Love your neighbour as you love yourself. If you obey this law of your King you do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.9'>But if you think one man is better than another, that is wrong. The law says you are a bad person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.10'>Anyone who obeys the law, but then breaks one of the laws, has broken all the laws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.11'>God made the law, Do not use sex wrongly. God also made the law, Do not kill.If you do not have wrong sex, but you kill, you have broken the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.12'>There is a law that makes people free. It is the law of showing kindness. Always talk and live like men who will be judged by that law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.13'>When God judges, he will not be kind to a person who has not been kind. It is better to be kind than it is to judge people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.14'>My brothers, perhaps a man says, I believe. What good is that if he does not do anything? Can just believing save him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.15'>Perhaps a brother or a sister needs clothes and has no food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.16'>Perhaps one of you says to them, God bless you. Be warm. Eat all you want. But what good is that if you do not give them what they need for their bodies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.17'>Believing is like that. If it does not do anything it is no good. Belief by itself is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.18'>In that case someone may say, You believe. And I do good things. Try to show me that you believe without doing any acts of kindness. I will show you that I believe by doing acts of kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.19'>You believe that there is one God. That is right. But even the bad spirits believe that. And they shake with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.20'>You are foolish! Believing is no good if it does not do anything good. Do you want to know that for sure?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.21'>Look at Abraham. God called our father Abraham a good man. This was because he gave his son Isaac to God on the holy table for a sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.22'>You can see he believed. His faith and the things he did worked together. His believing was made all right because he did something.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.23'>The words of the holy writings came true. They say, Abraham believed God. And he was called a good man because of it. In another place he was called Gods friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.24'>You see, a man is a good man because of the things he does, and not just because he believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.25'>Rahab was a bad woman. But in the same way God called her a good woman because of something she did. She took the men into her house and then let them go out another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.26'>A body is dead if it does not breathe. In the same way, believing is dead if it does not do anything good.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jas.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.1'>My brothers, not many of you should be teachers. You know that we who teach will be punished more than other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.2'>We all do many wrong things. Any man who never says anything wrong is right in every way. He is able to make his whole body do what is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.3'>We put a piece of iron in the mouths of horses so they will obey us. Then we can make their whole bodies go where we want them to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.4'>Look at the big boats also. They are very big. The strong winds push them along. But a man uses a small piece of wood and makes the boat go where he wants it to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.5'>A persons tongue is like that. It is a small part of the body but it talks about big things. A very small fire can burn a big pile of wood!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.6'>The tongue is like a fire. It is like a whole world of trouble. It is a part of our body. And it makes our whole body bad. It burns up our whole life. And the fire that makes the tongue burn comes from hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.7'>People have been able to tame all kinds of animals, birds, snakes, and fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.8'>But no one can tame the tongue. It is a bad thing that will not be ruled. It is full of poison that can kill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.9'>We praise our Lord and Father with our tongues. And we speak wrong words about people with our tongues, even though they were made like God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.10'>Praising and wrong words come out of the same mouth! My brothers, this should not be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.11'>Do good water and bad water both come from the same place?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.12'>My brothers, do olives come from a fig tree? Or do figs come from a vine? No, they do not! Salt water and fresh water do not both come from the same place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.13'>Who among you is wise and knows about things? He should show what he knows by his good life. He will not be proud because he is wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.14'>Are you a person who is very jealous? In your hearts you want to be better than others?  Then stop being proud of yourself. Do not say what is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.15'>God did not give you wisdom like that. But it comes from this world. It comes from people. It comes from bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.16'>If people are jealous of others, their lives are not right. They do every kind of wrong thing to get what they want. They confuse and upset people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.17'>First of all, when God makes people wise, they are holy. They do not fight. They are gentle. They listen to what other people say. They are very kind and do many good things. They do not quarrel. They do not say what is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.18'>People who do not quarrel have peace. When there is peace, there is a good life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.1'>Why do you fight and quarrel? It is because your feelings are fighting inside of you. That is why you fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.2'>You want something but you cannot get it. Then you kill. You want something very much and cannot get it. So you quarrel and fight. You do not get it because you do not ask God for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.3'>You ask for it, but you do not get it, because you ask in a wrong way. You want to use it for yourselves and not for others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.4'>You people promised God you would be true to him, but you did not stay true! Do you not know that if you love the world you hate God? Anyone who wants to be a lover of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.5'>The holy writings say, God gave his Spirit to live in us. And that Spirit wants us for himself. Do you think this means nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.6'>But God helps you even more than that. That is why the holy writings say, God fights against those who are proud, but he helps those who are not proud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.7'>So let God control you. Fight the devil and he will run away from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.8'>Come to God and he will come to you. You bad people, make your hands clean! You love what is good and what is wrong at the same time. Make your hearts clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.9'>Be sad about this, and cry. Turn your laughing into crying. Stop being happy. Be sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.10'>Do not be proud before the Lord. Then he will lift you up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.11'>My brothers, do not say wrong things about each other. A man who says wrong things about his brother or judges his brother is saying wrong things about Gods law and he is judging Gods law. If you judge the law, you are not obeying the law, but you are a judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.12'>God made the law and he is the judge. And he is the one who can save you or kill you.  Who are you that you should judge your neighbour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.13'>Listen to me! You say, Today or tomorrow we will go to that town. We will stay there a year. We will buy and sell and get rich. But you do not know what will happen to you tomorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.14'>What is your life like? It is like a cloud. It is here for a little while and then it is gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.15'>You should say If the Lord wants to do it, we will live and do this or that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.16'>But now you talk about the big things you will do. All that kind of talk is wrong!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.17'>But if a person knows what he should do and he does not do it, he has done something wrong.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jas.5.1'>Rich people, listen to me! Cry loud and long because of the troubles you will have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.2'>Your things are spoiled. Bugs have eaten your clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.3'>Your gold and silver are all spoiled. The wrong in them will prove that you have done wrong. The wrong will burn you up like fire. You have kept all these things and now time is almost ended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.4'>Listen! Men worked in your fields to cut your grain and you did not pay them! That money shouts against you. The men who cut your harvest have called out to the Lord who has power and he has heard them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.5'>You have had a good time on earth. You have done anything you wanted to do. Your lives are full of everything. Like a fat animal, you will soon be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.6'>You have punished good people. You have killed them. And they do not stop you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.7'>So brothers, take your troubles quietly and wait until the Lord comes. A farmer waits until the harvest grows from the ground. He waits for it a long time until it has had the first and second rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.8'>You must wait also. Keep your hearts strong, because the Lord will come soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.9'>Brothers, do not say mean things to each other. If you do, you will be judged. Listen, the judge is standing at the door now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.10'>My brothers, look at the lives of the prophets of God who spoke in the name of the Lord.  See the troubles they had. They took them and waited. Do as they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.11'>God blesses those who take their troubles quietly and keep on believing. You have heard about Jobs troubles and how he took them. And you have seen what the Lord did for him at the end. The Lord is very kind and helps people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.12'>My brothers, here is something that matters very much. When you make a promise do not ask heaven to hear it, or the earth, or any other thing. When you mean Yes, just say,  Yes. And when you mean No, just say, No. If you do that, you will not be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.13'>Is any one of you in trouble? He should talk to God about it. Is any one of you happy? He should sing songs of praise to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.14'>Is any one of you sick? He should call for the leaders of the church people. They should talk to God about him and put oil on him in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.15'>Because they talk to God, and believe, he will hear them. The sick man will be healed.  The Lord will make him well again. If the sick man has done wrong things, the Lord will forgive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.16'>So tell one another the wrong things you have done. And tell God about each others needs, so that you will be healed. When a good man talks to God, big things can be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.17'>Elijah was a man like us. He asked God not to let it rain. And for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.18'>Then he talked to God again. And it rained. Plants grew on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.19'>My brothers, has one of you left the right way? Has another person brought him back again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.20'>Do not forget that the person who has brought a man back from his wrong ways will save that man from death. He will cover up many wrong things and be forgiven.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.1'>I am Peter. I am an apostle of Jesus Christ. I send this letter to Gods chosen people. You are like people on a journey. You live in the countries of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,  Asia, and Bithynia. But you do not belong there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.2'>God the Father chose you as he planned to do long ago. You were made holy by the Spirit. You were chosen to obey Jesus Christ and to be made clean by the blood of his death. May you have much blessing and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.3'>Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! He was very kind to us, and made us his children. So we have a new hope. This hope is a living hope because Jesus Christ was raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.4'>Because we are Gods children, one day we shall receive special blessings. They cannot be spoiled in any way, and they will last for ever. They are kept safe in heaven for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.5'>You are saved by Gods power because you believe. You will then be fully saved. The way is ready and you will see it when the end of time comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>This makes you very glad, even though now maybe you are sad because you have troubles of many kinds. They are only for a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>To believe is worth more than to have gold. Gold can spoil, but it is tested by fire to show that it is good. So troubles test you to prove that you believe. Then, because you really believe, you will be praised and made great and have honour when Jesus Christ comes again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>You love him even though you have not seen him. You trust him even though you do not see him. And so you are very happy. No words can tell how happy you are. Your joy is very great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>God will reward you because you have believed. You will then be fully saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>The prophets of God long ago told about this way of being saved. They tried to find out about it and asked much about it. They spoke words from God telling about the blessing God would give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>The Spirit of Christ in them showed them that Christ would have troubles and after that he would be great. They tried to find out when these things would happen or how things would be when they did happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>The Spirit showed them that they told these things not for themselves, but for you. And now the men who told you the good news have told you these same things. They spoke by the power of the Holy Spirit who was sent from heaven. Even the angels wanted very much to know about these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>So think clearly. Keep awake. When Jesus Christ comes, he will bring you blessing. Set all your hope on that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>Be children who obey. Do not be like what you were before you knew Christ. Then you did anything you wanted to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>But be holy in all the things you do. Be holy because the one who has called you is holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>God says in the holy writings, You must be holy, because I am holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.17'>You call God your Father. He does not think one man is better than another. He judges everyone by what he has done. So then you must fear him as you live your life here on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.18'>You know this. You lived the way your fathers taught you to live, and it was not a good way to live. You were bought and set free from that way of life. But you were not bought with silver or gold money, which can spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.19'>You were bought with blood that is worth much. It is like the blood of a sheep that is perfect with nothing wrong in its body. You were bought with the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.20'>Before the world was made God chose Christ to do it, and Christ came at the end of time for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.21'>It is through Christ that you believe in God. God raised Christ from death and made him great. And that is why you are able to believe and hope in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.22'>You have obeyed what is true and that has made your hearts clean. And now you really love your Christian brothers. So with your clean hearts, love each other very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.23'>You have been made Gods children. He did not make you his children by something that dies, but by something that cannot die. That is the word of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>So stop all the wrong things you do. Stop all the ways you cheat people. Stop fooling people. Stop being jealous. Stop saying wrong things about people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.2'>Babies who have just been born want milk very much. In the same way, you should want Gods word. That is like good milk. It will make you grow up so that you will then be fully saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.3'>You should want Gods word if you have already tasted and know that the Lord is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.4'>Come to the Lord Jesus. He is like a living stone. People did not want to use it. But God chose it. It was worth very much to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>You also are like living stones. You are being built into a temple, a holy place for God.  You are to be holy priests there. You are to give sacrifices to God from your heart. God will accept them because of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>The holy writings say, Listen, I am placing a stone in Zion. It is the main stone of the house. I have chosen it and it is worth very much. Anyone who believes in him will not be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.7'>He is worth very much to you who believe in him. But some people do not believe in him.  To them he is, the stone that the men who were building would not use. But now it is the chief stone at the corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>And to them he is also, a stone on which people will hit their feet, and a rock that will make them fall down. They hit their feet on it, because they do not obey the word. It was planned that this would happen to them! But you are a chosen people. You are priests to your king. You are a holy nation. You are Gods very own people. All this is so that you will tell how good he is. He called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>At one time you were not Gods people. But now you are Gods people. At one time you did not know Gods kindness. Now you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>Dear brothers, you are people who do not belong to this world. You are like visitors who are on a journey. I beg you, do not do the things your body wants to do. Those things fight against your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Live good lives among the people who do not believe. They may talk about you as if you do wrong things. But when they see the good things you do, they will praise God on the day he comes to help you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>Obey every officer of the government to please the Lord. Obey the king because he is over all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Obey the rulers because they are sent by him. They are sent to punish those who do wrong things and to praise those who do good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>That is what God wants you to do. He wants you to do good things. By doing good things, you will stop foolish people from saying wrong things about you. They say wrong things about you because they do not know you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>You are free people. But do not think, I am free so I can do wrong things. You are Gods servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>Respect all men. Love your Christian brothers. Fear God. Respect the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>Servants, respect and obey your masters in all things. Obey not only those who are good to you. But also obey those who are hard on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>Maybe a person is punished when he has done nothing wrong. If he takes these troubles to please God, he does a very good thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>What praise will you have if you take a beating when you have done something wrong?  But when you do right and are punished, if you take it quietly, God is pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>You have been called to do this because Christ also was punished for you. He showed you what you should do. So do as he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>He did no wrong. And he told no lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>When people said wrong things to him, he did not say wrong things to them. When he was punished, he did not say, I will do something to you! But he trusted in God who judges what is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>Christ in his own body took the wrong things we have done to the cross. He did this so that we would stop our bad ways and live right. Because he was punished, you were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>Like lost sheep, you were going away from God. But now you have come back to the one who takes care of you and helps you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>missing fehlt/missing</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>Wives, respect and obey your husbands in the same way. Then the husbands who do not obey the word of God will want to know God. They will want to know God because their wives live good lives, even though they say nothing about God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.2'>They will see that you live holy lives and respect your husbands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>You should not be fine on the outside only. Some women make their hair nice. They wear gold things. They have fine clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.4'>But you must be fine in your heart. Have a heart that is gentle and quiet. That will not wear out. And God thinks it is worth very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.5'>There were holy women long ago who trusted in God. They made themselves nice in this way. They obeyed their husbands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>Sarah obeyed Abraham. She called him her master. You are her children if you do what is right and are not afraid of trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>Husbands, also live with your wife the way you know is right. Respect her because she is a woman. She is not as strong as a man. Also respect her because God has given her, as well as you, the blessing of life. In this way, you will not stop God from doing what you ask him to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>Here is one thing more. You must all agree. You must care when others have trouble.  You must love your Christian brothers. You must be kind. You must not be proud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>You must not do wrong things to those who do wrong things to you. You must not say wrong things to those who say wrong things to you. But ask God to bless those people.  This is what you have been called to do. Then God will bless you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>The holy writings say,A man who wants to live and have good days must not say wrong things. He must not say anything that is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.11'>He must turn away from anything wrong and do what is good. He must try hard to find peace, and keep on looking for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>The Lord watches over those who do good. He listens when they talk to him. But the Lord is against those who do wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>Who will do something bad to you if you want to do what is good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>But even if people trouble you because you do right, God will bless you. Do not be afraid of them. And do not be troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>Worship Christ as Lord in your hearts. Always be ready to give an answer to anyone who asks you about the hope you have. But be gentle and respect him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>Keep your hearts clean. Then when people say wrong things about you, they will be ashamed because they have talked wrongly about your good Christian life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>It is better to have trouble for doing right, if God allows it, than to have trouble for doing wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>For Christ died that once because of our wrong ways. He was good and he died for those who were bad. He did this to bring us to God. His body died, but his spirit had new life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>His spirit went and gave his message to peoples spirits who were in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>In the days long ago, they did not obey God. God waited for them to do so while Noah was building the big house on the boat. A few people, only eight, were saved by going through the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>The water of baptism is like that. It saves you. It does not save you because it washes dirt from your bodies. But it saves you because you bring yourselves to God with a clean heart. It saves you because Jesus Christ has been raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>He has gone up into heaven. He is now at the right side of God. Angels, rulers, and governments obey him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Christ suffered in his body. You also must be ready to have the same trouble happen to you. When a man has suffered in his body, he has stopped doing wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>For the rest of his life on earth he will not do what people want to do. He will do what God wants him to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>In the time past you did the same things as people who do not believe God. Let that be enough. You did things you should be ashamed of. You did what you wanted to do. You got drunk. You got into fights. You took part in noisy feasting with dancing. You did wrong by worshipping idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>Those people are surprised now that you do not do the same wrong things they do. And they say wrong things about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>They will have to explain what they are doing. They will have to talk to God about what they have done. He is ready to judge living people and dead people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>That is why the good news was also told to those who are now dead. They will be judged like men who are alive. This was done so that they could live like God in the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>It is almost the time when the world will end. So be wise and watch and talk to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>Here is something that matters very much. You must love each other very much. Love will cover up many wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>Be glad to take other Christians into your house and care for them. And do not grumble about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>God has given each person a gift. That gift is something he can do. Each one should use his gift to help the others. In that way you all make good use of the many blessings God has given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>Has God blessed you by knowing how to talk? Then you should talk the words of God.  Are you a helper? Then you should help with the strength God has given you. In all that you do, you should show that God is great through Jesus Christ. He has praise and power for ever. Yes, he has!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>My dear brothers, do not be surprised by the hard trouble like fire that comes to test you.  Do not think some new thing is happening to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>Be glad when you suffer as Christ did. Then you will also be very glad when he comes and you see how great he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>Do men say wrong things about you because you are a Christian? Then you are blessed because the wonderful Spirit, the Spirit of God, is with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not do wrong. Do not try to boss other people. None of you should suffer because you have done these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>But if a man suffers because he is a Christian, he should not be ashamed of it. He should praise God that he is a Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>The time has come for God to judge people. Gods people will be judged first. If we are judged first, what will happen at the end to those who do not obey the good news of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>The holy writings say, If it is hard for a good person to be saved, what will happen to a person who is against God and lives a bad life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>If God allows you to suffer, trust him. He made you and you can trust him. But keep on doing good things.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Pet.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.1'>So I am talking to the leaders among you. I am also a leader. I saw the sufferings of Christ. And I will have some part of his greatness when he comes again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.2'>Take good care of Gods people. They have been given to you to care for. Do this, not because you must do it, but because you want to please God. Do it not for the money that you get for doing it, but because you are glad to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.3'>Do not be like a boss over the people you care for, telling them how to live. But show them how to live by the way you live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.4'>Christ the big Shepherd who takes care of all people is coming. When he comes, he will give you a crown to show that you are great. You will have it for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.5'>Also, you who are younger men, obey your leaders. I say to all of you, do not be proud.  Do not think you are better than the others. The holy writings say, God fights against proud people, but he helps those who are not proud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.6'>You are under Gods power. Do not be proud, so that at the right time he may put you into a higher place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.7'>Turn all your troubles over to him, because he cares for you and is watching over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.8'>Keep awake! Watch! Your enemy the devil is walking around like a growling lion. He is looking for someone to catch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.9'>Fight against the devil. Be strong because you believe. Remember that your brothers all over the world suffer the same kind of trouble as you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.10'>God gives all blessings. He has called you through Christ to be great with him for ever.  When you have suffered for a short time, he will make you all right. He will make you strong and steady.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.11'>He has power for ever. Yes, he has!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.12'>Silas has written this short letter for me. I believe he is a brother who can be trusted. I have written to help you and tell you the true way to have Gods blessing. Stand firm in that way!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.13'>The church people in the city of Babylon greet you. God has also chosen them. My son Mark also greets you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.14'>Greet one another with a kiss of love. May all of you who are Christians have peace.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.1'>I am Simon Peter. I am a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I send greetings to you who have believed as we have. Believing is worth just as much to you as it is to us. This is because our God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, is right and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.2'>May the loving kindness of God bless you and give you more and more peace because you know God and Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.3'>Christ is God and by his own power he has given us everything that we need to live and to please God. He has given this to us because we know him, and he has called us because he is great and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.4'>Because of these things, he has promised us things that are worth very much and are very great. He has promised these things to us so that by them you may become like God too.  By them you will be kept free from the selfish desires of the people in the world. These desires lead to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.5'>So now you believe, try to live a good life. When you live a good life, try to learn more about God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.6'>When you have learned more, be strong to do what is right. Then go on doing what is right, even if it is hard. As you go about doing right, keep close to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.7'>As you keep close to God, love your Christian brothers. When you love your Christian brothers, love everyone!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.8'>If you do these things and you do them more and more, you will be good Christians and you will know more and more about our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.9'>But the man who does not do these things is like a blind man. He can see only a little way. He has forgotten that he was made clean from the wrong things he used to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.10'>So my brothers, try to show that God has called you and chosen you. If you do these things, you will never fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.11'>That will make it easy for you to go into the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. His kingdom will be for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.12'>I do want always to bring these things to your minds. I will do this even though you know them, and even though you are strong in the true way that you already have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.13'>I think it is right, as long as I live, to keep these things in your minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.14'>I know that I will not live long now. Our Lord Jesus Christ has told me about that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.15'>But I will try to see that you have something to bring these things to your minds, even after I am gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.16'>We have told you about the power of our Lord Jesus Christ and that he is coming again.  We did not tell you stories someone told us. We ourselves saw how great he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.17'>God the Father praised him and showed that he is great. A voice came from the bright cloud and said to him, This is my Son. I love him and he pleases me very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.18'>We heard this voice which came from heaven. It happened when we were on the holy hill with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.19'>And so we are more sure about what the prophets of God said long ago. You will do well to listen to them. It is like a lamp shining in a dark place. Then the daylight will come and the morning star will shine in your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.20'>First you must understand this. The words from the prophets in the holy writings did not come from their own minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.21'>The prophets did not say what they wanted to say. But the Holy Spirit made them speak.  And they spoke Gods message.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.1'>But prophets who were not true were also among the people of Israel. Also there will be teachers who will not be true among you. They will bring in wrong teaching that leads to death. They will even say that they do not belong to the Master who bought them. And so they will quickly bring themselves to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.2'>Many people will do the same wrong things they do. And because of them, men will say wrong things about the true way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.3'>Because they are greedy for money, they will trick you with lies. For a long time God has planned to punish them. They will be punished at the right time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.4'>God punished the angels who did wrong. He put them into the darkest part of hell. They must be kept there until the time when they will be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'>In the days long ago, God punished the world. But he saved Noah who told people what was right. And God saved seven other people. But he made water cover the world full of bad people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.6'>God burned up the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. He punished them so that no cities were left. He did this to show what would happen to bad people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.7'>But God saved Lot out of the trouble. Lot was a good man. He did not like the wrong way the bad people lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'>That good man lived among the bad people and he saw and heard what they did. Day after day, the bad things they did troubled his heart because he was a good man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>The Lord knows how to save good people out of the trouble that tests them. And he knows how to keep bad people until the day when he will judge them. And they are being punished even now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.10'>Most of all, he will punish people who do the wrong things they want to do and who will not obey the men who rule over them. They are very bold and proud. They do not fear to say wrong things about those who are great, even about the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'>Angels have more strength and power than they. And yet the angels do not judge them and say wrong things about them to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'>These people are like animals that cannot think. They are like animals that are born to be caught and killed. They say wrong things about things they do not understand. They will die like the animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'>Bad things will happen to them because they have done wrong things. They think it is fun to have a good time during the day. They are like spots and sores. They like to eat and drink at the love feasts with you. They are trying to fool you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'>They are always looking for women to have sex with them. They never stop their wrong ways. They fool people whose hearts are not strong to do right. They always want more and more money. Gods curse is on them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'>They have left the right road and have done wrong. They follow the same road that Balaam walked. He was the son of Beor. He loved the pay he would get for doing a wrong thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'>But he was told to stop doing wrong. The animal he was riding talked with a mans voice.  It tried to make the prophet stop his foolish way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'>These men are like wells with no water in them. They are like fog that is blown away by a strong wind. A very dark place has been kept to put them in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'>They say big and foolish things. They fool people who have just left those who live in wrong ways. They fool them by making them want to do wrong things with their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'>They promise them that they will be free. But they themselves are slaves of death. A man is a slave of anything that rules over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'>They left the wrong ways of the world because they knew our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Then when they went back to the wrong ways again, they were ruled by them.  Then they will have more trouble than they had at first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'>It would have been better for them if they had never known the right way! Because they knew the right way, it was very wrong for them to turn from the holy law God gave them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'>They show that this saying is true, The dog goes back to eat what his own stomach threw up! and, A pig that is washed rolls in the mud again!</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'>My dear brothers, this is my second letter to you. In both of my letters I have tried to bring some things to your good minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'>I want you to remember what Gods prophets said would happen. And I want you to remember what we apostles told you that our Lord and Saviour said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'>Here is the first thing. In the last days, men will come who will make fun of holy things.  They will do what they themselves want to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'>They will say, He promised to come. Where is he? Our fathers have died. And since then everything is just the same as it has been since the world was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'>They do not want to remember that long ago God spoke and made the sky. He made the land come up from the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>But later on these same waters covered the world in a flood and the people died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>The sky and the earth that are here now are being kept because God spoke. They are kept to be burned up. This will happen on the day when God judges people and they will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>My dear brothers, do not forget this one thing. One day is like a thousand years to the Lord. And a thousand years are like one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>God will do what he promised. He is not slow though, as some people think he is. But he is waiting a long time for you. He does not want anyone to die, but he wants all people to stop their wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>The day of the Lord will come like a man who wants to steal. There will be a loud noise and the sky will go away. The elements will melt with fire and they will be gone. The earth and everything on it will be burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>That is the way the whole world will go. So think what kind of people you should be!  Think how holy and true to God your lives should be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'>You should look for the day of God and do everything you can to make it come quickly.  On that day the sky will be on fire and go away. The elements will burn and melt away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>But we are looking for a new sky and a new earth which God has promised. Only good things will be in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>My dear brothers, you are looking for these things. So do all you can so that the Lord will find you without any bad or wrong thing in your lives. Let him find you at peace with one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>Think of this. He is waiting a long time so that people will be saved. Our dear brother Paul also wrote these things to you, because God has made him wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>He also tells about them in all his letters. Some things in his letters are hard to understand. Some people do not know about these things and they are not strong in their faith. They change the meaning of the things Paul wrote. They do this to other things in the holy writings also. Because they do this, they will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>My dear brothers, you know about these things before they happen. Take care that you do not do the same things that bad people do. Take care that you do not stop believing the right way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>Have more and more of Gods blessing and kindness. Learn more and more about our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. He is great now, and he will be great for ever! Amen! Yes he will!</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.1.1'>The Word of life always was living, even from the beginning. We heard him. We saw him with our own eyes. We looked at him, and we touched him with our own hands. We are writing to you about this Word of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.2'>This life came to earth. We saw him, and we know about him. And we tell you about this life that lives for ever. This life was with the Father and came to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.3'>We tell you also what we have seen and heard. We tell you so that you also will belong with us. And we belong with the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.4'>We write these things to you so that we all will be very happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.5'>God is like light and he is not dark at all. That is the message we heard from him. That is the message we are telling you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.6'>Do we say that we belong with him? And at the same time, do we live in the dark? Then what we say is not true, and what we do is not right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.7'>Do we live in the light, as God is in the light? Then we belong with others who belong to him. And the blood of the death of Jesus Christ makes us clean from all the wrong things we have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.8'>Do we say, We have no wrong ways?Then we are fooling ourselves, and we do not know what is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.9'>Let us tell God about our wrong ways. God can be trusted. He does what is right. He will forgive us for the wrong things we have done. He will make us clean from all that was wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.10'>Do we say, We have not done anything wrong?This is like saying that God is not true.  That means we do not accept Gods word.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1John.2'>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>My children, I am writing these things to you so that you will not do wrong things. But if anyone does something wrong, we have a Friend to help us. He speaks to God for us. He is Jesus Christ who does what is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'>He himself is the sacrifice God offered to pay for the wrong we have done. And he pays for the wrong things all people in all the world have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'>We can be sure that we know him when we obey his laws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'>If any man says, I know him and does not obey his laws, he is telling a lie. He does not know what is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.5'>But if any man obeys his word, he really loves God. Here is the way that we may be sure that we belong to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.6'>If any man says he belongs to him, he must live in the same way Christ lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'>My dear brothers, I am not writing you a new law. This is an old law. You had it from the beginning. The old law is the word which you have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'>But in a way, I am writing you a new law. The darkness is going away and the true light is shining already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'>Does anyone say he is in the light, and hates his brother? Then he is still in the dark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'>The man who loves his brother lives in the light. There is nothing in him to make him do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'>But the man who hates his brother is in the dark. He lives in the dark. He does not know where he is going, because the darkness has made him blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.12'>Children, I am writing to you because God has forgiven the wrong things you have done.  Your wrong ways have been forgiven because of what Christ did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'>Fathers, I am writing to you because you know the One who has lived from the beginning. Young men, I am writing to you because you have won the victory over the devil. Children, I write to you because you know Father God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'>Fathers, I write to you because you know him, the one who has lived from the beginning.  Young men, I write to you because you are strong. You believe Gods word. You have won the victory over the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Do not love the world, or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, he does not love the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'>Nothing in the world comes from the Father. I mean the wrong things people like to do with their bodies. I mean the things people see and want to have. I mean all the things people are proud of in this life. These things come from the world, not the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'>And the world will go away and all the things in it that people like to do. But the person who does what God wants him to do will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'>Children, we are very near the end of time. You have heard that someone will come who is against Christ. Many who are against Christ have already come. That is how we know that we are very near the end of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>They left us, but they did not belong with us. If they had belonged with us, they would have stayed with us. But they left us so that people could see that all of them did not belong with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.20'>But the Holy One has given you a gift of understanding so that you all may know what is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.21'>I write to you, not because you do not know what is true, but because you do know. And you know that no lie is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.22'>Who then is the one who says what is not true? It is the one who says that Jesus is not the Christ. That person is against Christ, because he says there is no Father and there is no Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'>Everyone who says Jesus is not the Son does not know the Father. And everyone who says Jesus is the Son knows the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'>So keep what you have heard from the beginning. If you keep what you have heard from the beginning, you too belong to the Son and to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.25'>And he himself has promised us that we will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'>I have written these things to you about the ones who try to fool you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'>You have a gift of understanding from Christ. That gift stays with you. You do not need anyone to teach you. His gift teaches you about everything. It is true. It is not a lie. So stay with him as he has taught you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.28'>Now, my children, stay with Christ. Then we will not be afraid on that day when we see him again. We will not be ashamed to stand before him when he comes again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.29'>You know that he does what is right. So you know also that everyone who does what is right is his child.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.3'>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.1'>See how much the Father has loved us! We are called Gods children. It is true, we are Gods children. People in this world did not know him and so they do not know us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.2'>My dear brothers, we are Gods children now. No one knows yet what we shall be like.  But we know that when Jesus comes, we will be like him. We will see him as he really is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'>Everyone who has this hope about Christ makes his life holy. He makes his life holy and clean, just as Christ is holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'>Everyone who does wrong things is breaking Gods law. Doing wrong things is breaking the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'>You know that Christ came to take away the wrong things people have done. He is the one who has done no wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'>Everyone who stays with him does not do wrong things. Everyone who does wrong things has never seen him and has never known him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.7'>My children, do not let anyone fool you. Anyone who does what is good, is good just as Christ is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>Anyone who does what is wrong belongs to the devil. The devil has done what is wrong from the beginning. That is why Gods Son came. He came to stop what the devil does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>No one who is Gods child does wrong things, because Gods life is in him. And he cannot keep on doing wrong things, because he is Gods child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>This is how people can know who are Gods children and who are the devils children.  Everyone who does not do right is not Gods child. And anyone who does not love his brother is not Gods child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'>This is the word you have heard from the beginning. We must love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'>We must not be like Cain. He was a child of the devil and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? He killed him because the things he himself did were wrong, and the things his brother did were right with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.13'>My brothers, do not be surprised if people in this world hate you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'>We know that we have gone from death to life. We know this because we love the Christian brothers. Anyone who does not love them has not gone from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.15'>Everyone who hates his brother is like a man who kills a person. And you know that no one who kills a person has life that will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'>Christ died for us. That is how we know what love is. We also should be willing to die for our brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'>Perhaps a man has plenty of food and things. He sees that his brother needs some. If he does not want to help his brother, does he love God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'>My children, we must not only talk about loving people; we must show we love people by what we do for them. We must really love them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'>And this is how we will know that we are true. This is why we will not be afraid in front of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'>Even if our hearts think we are wrong, God is greater than our hearts and he knows everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'>My dear brothers, if our hearts do not think we are wrong, we will not be afraid in front of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'>If we ask God for something, we get it. We get it because we obey his laws. We get it because we do what pleases him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.23'>This is his law. We must believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ. And we must love one another as he told us to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.24'>If anyone obeys his laws, he belongs to God and God belongs to him. God has given us the Holy Spirit. That is how we know that God is with us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.4'>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.1'>My dear brothers, do not trust every spirit. But test the spirits to see if they belong to God. There are many prophets who are not true who have gone out into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.2'>Here is how you can know the Spirit of God. Every spirit that believes that Jesus Christ has come in the body of a man is from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.3'>And every spirit that does not say this about Jesus, does not belong to God. That is the spirit of the one who is against Christ. You have heard that he is coming. And now he is already in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.4'>My children, you belong to God. You have won the victory over those prophets who are not true. You have won because the Spirit that is in you is stronger than the spirit that is in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.5'>Those prophets belong to the world. That is why they teach about things in the world.  And that is why the people of the world listen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.6'>But we belong to God. Anyone who knows God listens to us. Anyone who does not belong to God does not listen to us. This is how we know if a spirit is true or not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.7'>My dear brothers, we must love one another, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves others is Gods child and he knows God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.8'>But anyone who does not love others does not know God, because God is love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.9'>This is how God showed his love for us. He sent his only Son into the world to give us life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.10'>This is love! We did not love God, but he loved us. And he sent his Son to be the sacrifice to pay for the wrong things we have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.11'>My dear brothers, if God loved us so much, we must love one another also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.12'>No man has ever seen God. But God lives in us if we love one another. And in loving one another, his love is made perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.13'>He has given us of his own Spirit. That is how we know that we are in him and he is in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.14'>And we have seen and we are telling you that the Father sent his Son to save the people in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.15'>If anyone says, Jesus is the Son of God, God is in him and he is in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.16'>We know and we believe that God loves us. God is love. And anyone who loves others is in God and God is in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.17'>That is why we love each other very much. Then we will not be afraid on the day when people are judged. We are like Christ in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.18'>Where Gods love is, there is no fear. Gods perfect love takes away fear. It is punishment that makes a person fear. Anyone who has fear does not have perfect love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.19'>We love others because God first loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.20'>If anyone says, I love God,and he hates his brother, he is telling a lie. If he does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.21'>God gave us this law. The person who loves God must love his brother also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.5'>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.1'>Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is Gods child. And everyone who loves the Father loves his child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.2'>This is how we know we love Gods children. We love God and we obey his laws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.3'>We show that we love God when we obey his laws. His laws are not hard to obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.4'>Everyone who is Gods child wins a victory over the world. We win because we believe God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.5'>Who wins a victory over the world? It is only the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.6'>There was water and there was blood when Jesus Christ came. There was not water only, but there was water and there was blood. The Spirit proves this is true, because the Spirit is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.7'>There are three in heaven who prove it is true. They are the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit. These three are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.8'>There are three on earth who prove it is true. They are the spirit, the water, and the blood. These three all prove the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.9'>We believe what people prove to us. But when God proves something it is stronger than what people prove. This is what God proved about his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.10'>Anyone who believes in Gods Son believes what God says about him. Anyone who does not believe God shows that he thinks what God says is not true. He has not believed what God says about his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.11'>Here is what God says. He has given us life that will last for ever. And this life is in his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.12'>So anyone who has the Son has this life. Anyone who does not have the Son of God does not have this life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.13'>I have written these things to you who believe on the name of the Son of God. I have written them so that you will know that you will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.14'>And we are sure God will do this. If we ask him for anything that he wants us to have, he will listen to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.15'>And if we know he listens to us when we ask for anything, then we know that we have what we asked him for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.16'>Maybe a man sees his brother do something wrong, but not so bad that he must die for it.  The man should ask God and God will let his brother live. God will let people live if the things they have done are not so bad that they must die for them. But there are things so wrong that a person must die for them. If he has done such as that, I do not tell the man to ask God to let him live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.17'>Everything that is wrong is a bad thing. But not every bad thing is so wrong that a person must die for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.18'>We know that any child of God does not do wrong things. The Son of God keeps him safe and the devil cannot touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.19'>We know that we belong to God and the whole world belongs to the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.20'>We know that the Son of God has come. He has given us a heart to know him who is true. We belong to him who is true, because we belong to his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God. He has the life that will live for ever.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jude.1.1'>I am Jude. I am a servant of Jesus Christ and I am a brother of James. I send greetings to you whom God the Father has called. He has loved you and kept you safe for Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.2'>May God be kind to you. May he give you peace. May he love you very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.3'>My dear brothers, I wanted very much to write to you and tell you how we all are saved.  But then I saw that I must write and tell you to hold very strongly to what you do believe.  Fight against those who want to change it. The right way to believe has been given to Gods people once for all times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.4'>Some men have come in quietly. They are bad men. The holy writings told us long ago that they would be punished. These men change the blessing of our God to do the wrong things they want to do. They show by their lives that they do not belong to Jesus Christ,  our only Master and Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.5'>You know all these things for all times. But I want to bring them to your minds. First, the Lord saved his people from the country of Egypt. At a time after that, he killed those who did not believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.6'>Remember the angels also. Some of them did not keep the high place they had. But they left their home. God has them tied in chains for ever, and he is keeping them in a very dark place. He will keep them there until that big day when they will be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.7'>Also Sodom and Gomorrah and the other cities near them show what will happen. The people there had wrong ways of using sex and did wrong things that people should not do with each other. They were punished and are in fire that burns for ever. God did this to show what will happen to others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.8'>And yet these men do the same wrong things. They think of and do wrong things with their bodies. They will not obey the men who rule over them. And they say wrong things about those who are great, even about the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.9'>At one time Michael the chief angel had a quarrel with the devil about who should have the body of Moses. But he did not dare to judge the devil and say wrong things about him. He said, May the Lord tell you to stop!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.10'>But these men say wrong things about everything they do not understand. They know some things just like animals that cannot think. And they will die because they do those wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.11'>They will have trouble! They have lived like Cain. They have done wrong things for pay like Balaam. They have talked against those who are over them. Korah did that. And so they will die as he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.12'>These men spoil your love feasts. They are not afraid to eat and drink with you. They take care only of themselves. They are like clouds that do not give rain, and are blown around by the winds. They are like trees when their leaves are gone and they have no fruit. These trees are also dead because they have been pulled up by the roots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.13'>These men are like big waves on the sea. Big waves cause much trouble. And these men also show the wrong things they do. They are like stars that have fallen from their place in the sky. A very dark place has been kept for ever in which to put these men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.14'>Enoch was the seventh in Adams family line. He spoke words from God to these men also. He said, Listen! The Lord came with many thousands of his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.15'>He came to judge all people and to punish all the bad people for all the wrong things they have done. And he came to punish bad people for all the wrong things that they have said against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.16'>These men complain about the way things are. They do not like it. They do what they themselves want to do. They say big things. They say nice things to people to get what they want from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.17'>But, my dear brothers, you must remember what the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ said would happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.18'>They said to you, At the end of time, men will come who will make fun of holy things.  They will do the wrong things they themselves want to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.19'>These are the men who make people go into different groups in the church meetings.  They have only a mans heart. They do not have the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.20'>But you, my dear brothers, must make your lives better in the holy things you believe.  Talk to God in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.21'>Keep yourselves in Gods love. Wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to come and help you. He will give you life that will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.22'>Some people are not sure what they believe. Be kind to them by sharing in their troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.23'>Pull them out of the fire and save them. There are other people to whom you must be kind, but be careful about it. But you must hate even the clothes that bad people have worn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.24'>God can keep you from doing anything wrong. He can bring you to the place where he is great and you will be all good. You will be very happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.25'>He is the only God. And he is our Saviour through our Lord Jesus Christ. He is great! He is wonderful! He has power! He has the right to rule! He was like that before time began!  He is like that now! And he will be like that for ever. Yes, he will!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>God showed these things to Jesus Christ to show to his servants. These are things that must happen soon. Then God sent his angel and showed them to John, his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>John wrote down what God said and what Jesus showed to him. These words tell all that He saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>God will bless the person who reads the words of this book. God will bless those who hear the words of this book and obey the things written in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>Here is what John wrote to the people of the seven churches which are in the country of Asia Minor: May Gods loving kindness bless you and give you peace. He lives now, he always has lived, and he will come again. May the seven Spirits bless you and give you peace. They stand in front of Gods throne &lt;FI&gt;chief chair of a king&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>May Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace. What he says is true. He was the first to rise from death. And he is ruler of the kings of the earth. He loves us. By his own blood &lt;FI&gt;death&lt;Fi&gt; he has made us free from the wrong things we have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>He has made us into kings and priests to his God and Father. Praise him! He is great and has power for ever! Yes, it is so!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Watch! He will come in the clouds. Every one will see him. Those who stuck a spear in him will also see him. All the tribes on earth will cry when they see him. That is the way it will be. Yes it will!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>The Lord God says, I am the First and the Last. I am the beginning and the ending. I live now. I always have lived, and I will come again. I have all power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I am John, your brother. I belong to Jesus and I am having big trouble just as you are. I also belong to his kingdom and I wait patiently for it. I was on an island called Patmos because I told the word of God and talked about Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in the Spirit on the Lords day. Behind me I heard a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet or horn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>The voice said, Write what you see in a book. Send it to the seven churches in the cities of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>I turned to see who was talking to me. I saw seven gold lamps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>In the centre of the seven lamps I saw someone like the Son of Man. He was wearing a long gown with a wide, gold belt around his chest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>The hair on his head was white like sheeps hair, white as snow. His eyes shone like a flame of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>His feet shone like fine brass that has been made pure by fire. His voice was like the sound of much water flowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>In his right hand he had seven stars. Out of his mouth came a long knife or sword, sharp on both sides. His face shone like the sun when it is shining very brightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>When I saw him, I fell down in front of him as if I had died. He put his right hand on me and said, Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>I am he who lives. I died. But look, I am alive for ever. I have the keys to death and to the world of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>So write what you have seen. Write the things that are now and the things that will happen after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>You saw seven stars in my right hand. I will tell you the secret meaning of them and of the seven gold lamps. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. The seven lamps are the seven churches.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>Write this to the angel of the church people in Ephesus: Here are the words of the one who holds the seven stars in his hand, the one who walks among the seven gold lamps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>He says, "I know the things you do. I know that you work hard and are patient. I know that you have nothing to do with bad men. You tested those who say they are messengers from God but are not. You proved that they are not true apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>I know that you are patient and are strong for my names sake. And you have not given up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>But here is what I say against you. You do not love as you loved at first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>So remember what you were like at first. Stop! Live the way you did at first. If you do not, I will come and move your lamp from its place. I will do it if you do not stop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But this is good: you hate the things which the people called Nicolaitans do. I hate the things they do also."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. He says, "I will let the person who wins eat fruit from the tree of life. It grows in Gods garden."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>Write this to the angel of the church people in Smyrna: Here are the words of the one who is the First and the Last. He is the one who died but lived again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>He says, "I know the things you do and the trouble you have. I know you are poor. But you are rich in some ways. I know some people do not respect God. They call themselves Jews. But they are not real Jews. They belong to Satans people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Do not be afraid of the troubles you will have. Yes, the devil will put some of you into prison where you will be tested. You will have trouble for ten days. But keep on believing, even if you have to die for it. I will give you life for ever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He who can hear should listen to the message of the Spirit to the churches. He says,  "The person who wins will not be hurt by the second death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>Write this to the angel of the church people in Pergamum: Here are the words of the one who has the long knife which is sharp on both sides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>He says, "I know where you live. You live where Satan rules. But you keep my name and you have never said that you do not believe in me. You kept on believing in me even in the time of Antipas. He said he believed in me and was true to me. He was killed among you where Satan lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things to say against you. You have some people there who believe the teaching of Balaam. He showed Balak how to trick the people of Israel and make them do wrong. They ate food that was given to idols, and they used sex wrongly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>Also, you have people among you who believe the teaching of the Nicolaitans. I hate the things they do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Stop! If you do not, I will come soon and I will fight against them with the long knife that comes from my mouth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. He says, "I will give some of the secret food to the person who wins. And I will give him a white stone. A new name will be written on the stone. No one will know the name but the one who gets the stone."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>Write this to the angel of the church people in Thyatira: Here are the words of the Son of God. He is the one whose eyes shine like a flame of fire, and his feet shine like fine brass.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have this to say against you. You let that woman named Jezebel keep on teaching.  She calls herself a prophet of God but teaches my servants wrong things. She fools them to use sex wrongly and eat food that has been given to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>I gave her time to stop, but she will not stop her wrong sexual ways and turn back to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Look, I will make her very sick, and also those who love her. I will do it if they do not stop what they are doing with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>I will kill her children. Then all the churches will know that I find out what is in a persons mind and heart. I will pay each one of you for the good or wrong things you have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But some of you in Thyatira do not listen to that womans teaching. You have not learned what some people call the deep things of Satan. To you I say, I will put no other load on you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>From the throne came lightning, loud noises, and thunder. In front of the throne, seven bright lamps were burning. These lamps are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>In front of the throne, it was like a sea of glass. It looked like a stone called crystal.  Around the throne on the four sides of it were four living beings. They had many eyes in their faces and in their back.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>The living beings give praise and honour and thanks to the one who sits on the throne and lives for ever and ever.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>I saw a book in the right hand of the one who sat on the chief chair. It had writing on the front and the back. It was locked with seven locks.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when he took the book, the four living beings and the twenty-four leaders kneeled down in front of the Lamb. Every one of them had a harp and a gold bowl.

        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And the four living beings and the leaders sang a new song. The new song was: You are able to take the book and to open its locks, because you were killed. You have set the people free and bought them for God with the cost of your blood. They are from every tribe, language, nation, and country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>You have made them into kings and priests for our God. They will rule on the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>I saw the Lamb open one of the seven locks. I heard the voice of one of the four living beings call, Come! It sounded like thunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I looked and saw a white horse. The man who rode on it had a bow to shoot arrows.  A gold crown for his head was given to him. And he went out fighting to win the victory over his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>When the Lamb opened the second lock, I heard the second living being call, Come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And another horse came out. It was red. The man who rode on it was allowed to take peace away from the earth, so that men would kill each other. The man who rode on it was given a long knife or sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>When the Lamb opened the third lock, I heard the third living being call, Come! I looked and saw a black horse. The man who rode on it had scales in his hand to weigh things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>I heard a voice among the four living beings. It said, Four cups of wheat for bread will sell for a days wages. Twelve cups of barley will sell for a days wages. But do not destroy the oil and the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>When the Lamb opened the fourth lock, I heard the fourth living being call, Come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>I saw a horse the colour of ashes. The name of the man who rode it was Death. And the one who controls the world of the dead followed him. They were given power over a fourth part of the world. They could kill people with a sword, or by making them go without food to eat, or by making them sick, or with wild animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>When the Lamb opened the fifth lock, I saw the souls of people who had been killed.  They were under the holy table where incense is burned. They had been killed because they believed Gods word and said they believed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>They called in a loud voice, Lord, you are holy and true. How long will you wait before you judge and punish the people on earth because they killed us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>Then each one of them was given a white gown to wear. They were told to wait a little longer for the other Christian brothers. Those who worked with them for the Lord would be killed as they had been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>I saw the Lamb opening the sixth lock. The earth shook very much. The sun became very dark, like the black cloth people wear to show they are sad. The full moon became red like blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>The stars in the sky fell to the earth. They fell like figs that are not ripe when the fig tree is shaken by a strong wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>The sky was taken away like paper being rolled up. Every big hill and island was shaken out of its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>The kings of the world, the great men, the army captains, the rich people, the strong people, every slave, and every freeman hid themselves in holes and the rocks on the big hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>They called to the hills and to the rocks and said, Fall on us! Hide us so the One on the throne will not see us. Hide us from the Lamb who is angry with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>The great day has come, and he is very angry with us. Who can stand before him?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>After this, I saw four angels standing at four different places on the earth. They were holding back the winds coming from every way. They did this so that no wind would blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>Then I saw another angel coming up from the place where the sun rises. He had something to put the mark of the living God on people. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels. They had been given power to hurt the earth and the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>The angel said, Do not hurt the earth, the sea, or the trees until we have put a mark on the foreheads of Gods servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>And I heard that one hundred and forty-four thousand people were marked. They were from every tribe of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>Twelve thousand people were marked from each of these tribes: Judah, Reuben, Gad,  Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.9'>After this, I looked and saw many people. There were so many that no person could count them all. They were from every country, tribe, nation, and language. I saw them standing in front of the throne and the Lamb. They wore white clothes and they had palm branches in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.10'>They called in a loud voice and said, Our God who sits on the throne, and the Lamb:  they are the Ones who save people. Salvation belongs to them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.11'>All the angels were standing around the throne and around the leaders and the four living beings. They bowed down their faces in front of the throne and worshipped God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.12'>They said, May it be so! Blessing, praise, glory and wisdom, thanks, honour, power, and strength belong to our God for ever and ever! Amen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.13'>Then one of the leaders talked to me. He said, Who are these people wearing white clothes? Where did they come from?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.14'>Then I said to him, Sir, I do not know. And he said to me, These are the people who have had much trouble. They have washed their clothes in the blood of the Lamb and made them white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.15'>That is why they are in front of Gods throne. They worship him day and night in his temple. The one who sits on the throne will keep them safe because he is with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.16'>They will not be hungry or thirsty again. The sun or any other heat will not burn them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.17'>The Lamb who is in front of the throne will take care of them. He will guide them to the places where there is water that gives life. And God will wipe every tear from their eyes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.1'>When the Lamb opened the seventh lock, all was quiet in heaven for about a half hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.2'>Then I saw the seven angels stand in front of God. Seven horns or trumpets were given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.3'>Another angel came and stood at the altar. He had a gold bowl. Plenty of incense was given to him. He was to put it with all the words of all Gods people when they talk to him. He was to put it on the gold altar in front of Gods throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.4'>The sweet smelling smoke of the burning incense went up at the same time as the prayer words of Gods people. They went up from the hand of the angel that was standing in front of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.5'>Then the angel took the bowl and filled it with fire from the altar. He threw it on the earth. There was thunder, loud noises, and lightning. And the earth shook.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.6'>The seven angels who had the seven horns or trumpets got ready to blow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.7'>The first angel blew his trumpet. Rain like stones, and fire mixed with blood, fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burned. A third of the trees was burned. And one third of all the green grass was burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.8'>The second angel blew his trumpet. Then something like a big hill, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.9'>Then a third of the sea became blood. A third of all things that lived in the sea died. A third of all the boats was broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.10'>The third angel blew his trumpet. A big star fell from the sky. It burned and gave a bright light. It fell on a third of the rivers and places where there is water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.11'>The name of the star is Bitter. A third part of the water became bitter. Many men died because the water was made bad to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.12'>The fourth angel blew his trumpet. A third of the sun was made dark. And a third of the moon and a third of the stars were made dark. A third part of them became dark. A third part of the day had no light, and also a third part of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.13'>Then I looked and heard an angel who was flying across the sky. He called in a loud voice and said, Trouble! Trouble! Trouble to the people who live on earth! Big trouble will come when the sound of the other trumpets is heard. The three angels are now ready to blow their trumpets!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.1'>Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet. I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The key to the big hole that has no bottom was given to the angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.2'>He opened the big hole and smoke came out. It was like the smoke of a very big fire. The sun and the air were made dark by the smoke from the big hole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.3'>Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth like big grasshoppers. They were given the power to hurt people the way that scorpions do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.4'>They were told not to spoil any of the grass, nor any green plant, nor any tree on earth.  They were told to hurt only the people who did not have Gods mark on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.5'>They were told not to kill them, but to trouble them for five months. The pain they give is like the pain a scorpion gives when it strikes a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.6'>In those days people will look for death, but they will not be able to find it. They will want to die, but death will fly away from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.7'>The locusts looked like horses ready to go to war. On their heads were gold crowns. And they had faces like people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.8'>Their hair was like womens hair and their teeth like lions teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.9'>Their bodies were covered by something like pieces of iron. The noise of their wings sounded like many wagons and horses running to war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.10'>The locusts had tails like scorpions that could strike people and hurt them for five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.11'>The king of the locusts is the angel of the big hole that has no bottom. His name is Abaddon in the Jews language and Apollyon in the Greek language. (This means, the one who destroys.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.12'>The first trouble is gone. Two more troubles are coming after it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.13'>The sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar in front of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.14'>The voice said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Untie the four angels who are tied at the big river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.15'>So the four angels were let free. They were ready for the hour, the day, the month, and the year when they would kill a third of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.16'>In their army were many, many thousands of men on horses. I heard the number of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.17'>I saw what the horses and the men that sat on them looked like. The bodies of the men were covered by pieces of iron that looked red like fire and blue, and yellow. The heads of the horses were like lions heads. Fire, smoke and dust came out of their mouths. The dust was sulphur which choked and killed people when it burned in the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.18'>By these three big troubles a third part of the people were killed. They were killed by the fire, smoke, and choking sulphur dust that came out of the mouths of the horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.19'>The power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. Their tails have heads and are like snakes. They hurt people with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.20'>The other people were not killed by these big troubles. But they did not stop worshipping what they had made with their hands. They did not stop worshipping bad spirits and idols made of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood. These idols cannot see or hear or walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.21'>And they did not stop their killing, or their witchcraft, or their wrong ways of using sex,  or their stealing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.1'>Then I saw another strong angel coming down from the sky. A cloud was around him and a rainbow was over his head. His face was like the sun and his legs were like posts of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.2'>In his hand he had a small book that was open. He put his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.3'>He called in a very loud voice like a lion roaring. When he called, it was like the voices of seven thunders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.4'>When the seven thunders had spoken, I was going to write down what they said. But I heard a voice from the sky that said, Do not tell what the seven thunders said. Do not write it down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.5'>The angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand toward the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.6'>He made a promise in the name of the one who lives for ever and ever. He made it in the name of the one who made the sky and everything in it, who made the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it. He said, There is no more time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.7'>But when the seventh angel calls by blowing his trumpet, then the secret plan of God will be finished. It will happen just as God told his servants, the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.8'>The voice I heard in the sky talked to me again. It said, Go to the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land. Take the open book from his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.9'>So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little book. He said to me, Take it and eat it. It will be bitter inside you, but it will be sweet like honey in your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.10'>So I took the little book from the angels hand and ate it. It was sweet like honey in my mouth. But when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.11'>Then he said to me, You must tell again what God is saying to many nations, countries,  languages, and kings.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.1'>Then I was given a long stick. And he said, Go and measure Gods temple and the altar,  and count the people who worship there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.2'>Do not measure the part outside the temple. Leave it out, because it has been given to the people who do not believe in God. They will walk in the holy city for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.3'>I will give power to the two men who speak for me. They will speak words from God.  They will continue to speak for forty-two months. They will wear clothes like people wear to show they are sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.4'>These two men are the two olive trees and the two lamps which stand in front of the Lord of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.5'>If any one wants to hurt them, fire comes out of their mouths and burns up their enemies.  If anyone wants to hurt them, he must be killed in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.6'>These two men can stop the sky from raining all the days that they speak words from God. And they can turn the water into blood. They can bring all kinds of trouble to the earth as often as they want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.7'>There is a beast which is a wild animal in the big hole that has no bottom. When the two men have finished talking, the beast will come up out of the hole. It will fight with the men. It will win over them and kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.8'>Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the big city. This city is called, Sodom and Egypt, because it is like them. Also it is where our Lord was nailed to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.9'>People from many nations, tribes, languages, and countries will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days. They will not let anyone bury them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.10'>The people on earth will be very glad to see them dead. They will have a happy time.  They will give gifts to each other because these two men from God had troubled the people on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.11'>But after the three and a half days, life came into them. They stood on their feet. And all those who saw them were very much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.12'>Then they heard a loud voice from the sky saying to them, Come up here! They went up into the sky in a cloud. And the men who hated them saw them go up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.13'>At that time, the earth shook very much. A tenth part of the city fell down. Seven thousand people were killed by the shaking of the earth. The other people were very much afraid and they give glory to God in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.14'>The second trouble is gone. The third trouble is coming soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.15'>Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet. Loud voices were heard in the sky. They said,  The kingdom of the world now belongs to our Lord and to his Christ. He will rule for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.16'>Then the twenty-four leaders who sat on their thrones in front of God kneeled down and worshipped God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.17'>They said, We thank you, Lord God, who has all power. You live now and you always have lived. We thank you because you have now used your power and started to rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.18'>The people who did not believe you became angry. But now you are angry. It is time for dead people to be judged. And it is time to reward your servants, the prophets of God,  and your holy people and all who respect your name-those who are great and those who are not so great. It is time to destroy those who destroy the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.19'>Then the temple of God in heaven was opened. The box where his agreement was kept was seen inside the temple. And there was lightning, loud noises, and thunder. The earth shook and much rain, like stones, fell.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.1'>I saw a wonderful thing in the sky. A woman was wearing the sun like a dress. She stood on the moon. On her head she had twelve stars in a big ring like a crown. She was going to have a baby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.2'>She cried out in pain because it was time for the baby to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.3'>And another wonderful thing was seen in the sky. It was a big red dragon. He had seven heads and ten horns. He had seven big rings on his heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.4'>His tail struck a third part of the stars from the sky to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who would soon have a baby. He wanted to eat her baby when it was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.5'>Then her baby boy was born. He will rule all the countries with an iron stick. Her child was taken up to God, to Gods throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.6'>The woman ran away into the wilderness. There God had made a place ready for her.  There she will have food for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.7'>Then there was fighting in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.8'>But they did not win the fight and no longer were they allowed to stay in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.9'>The dragon was thrown down. He was that old snake who is called the devil and Satan.  He fools all the people in the world. He was thrown down to earth and his angels were thrown down with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.10'>I heard a loud voice in the sky. It said, Now the time has come for God to save people.  He will use his strength. His kingdom will come and his Christ will use his power. The one who says bad things about our brothers to God day and night has been thrown down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.11'>They have won the fight against him by the blood of the Lambs death, and by what they said. They did not try to save their lives, but were willing to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.12'>Heaven, and those who live in heaven, be glad because of it! Big trouble will come to the earth and sea! The devil has come down to you. He is very angry. He knows that he has only a short time!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.13'>And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to earth, he troubled the woman to whom a baby boy had been born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.14'>But the woman was given two wings like a big eagles wings. With them she could fly away from the dragon into the wilderness to her place where she would have food for three and a half periods of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.15'>The dragon poured water like a river out of his mouth after her. He wanted the water to carry her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.16'>But the earth helped the woman. It opened a big hole. And the river which the dragon had poured out of his mouth went down the hole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.17'>Then the dragon was very angry with the woman. He went away to fight against the other children of the woman. They are the ones who keep the laws of God and tell the truth about Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.1'>Then I stood on the sand by the sea. I saw a wild animal come up out of the sea. The beast had seven heads and ten horns. On its horns were ten big crowns. On its heads it had names that did not respect God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.2'>The beast I saw was like a leopard. It had feet like a bear and a mouth like a lion. The dragon gave it his own strength, his own throne, and great power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.3'>One of its heads had a cut, bad enough to kill it. But the bad cut was healed. All the people on earth were much surprised and followed the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.4'>They worshipped the dragon because he had given this power to the beast. And they worshipped the beast too. They said, Who is like this beast? Who can fight against it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.5'>The beast was given a mouth that spoke proud words against God. It was given power to rule for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.6'>It opened its mouth to speak against God, to speak against his name and the place where he lives, and to speak against those who live in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.7'>It was also given power to fight against Gods people and to win the fight against them. It was given power to rule over every tribe, nation, language, and country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.8'>Everyone on earth will worship the beast, if they do not have their names in the book of life. The book of life belongs to the Lamb who was killed. That was Gods plan since the world was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.9'>He who can hear should listen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.10'>Anyone who puts people in prison will go to prison. Any one who kills others with a long knife or sword will be killed by a long knife or sword. This is why Gods people are patient and keep on believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.11'>Then I saw another beast come up out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb but talked like a dragon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.12'>It uses all the power of the first beast and stands with it. It makes all the earth and those who live on it worship the first beast. That was the beast whose bad cut was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.13'>The second beast does wonderful things. It even makes fire fall from the sky to the earth for everyone to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.14'>It fools the people who live on earth by the wonderful things which it has been given power to do, while the first beast looks on. It tells the people on earth to make an idol like the first beast that was cut by the big knife but lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.15'>It was given power to make the idol of the beast live. The idol of the beast could speak and command all those who would not worship the idol to be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.16'>It makes all the people take a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads. That means all people, those who are great and those who are not great, the poor, free men, and slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.17'>No one could buy or sell anything if he did not have this mark. This mark is the name of the beast or the number of its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.18'>Here wisdom is needed. If a person understands, he should count the number of the beast. It is the number of a mans name. Its number is six hundred and sixty-six.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.1'>The song of the 144,000 Then I looked and saw the Lamb standing on a hill called Zion.  With him were one hundred and forty-four thousand people. They had his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.2'>I heard a sound from the sky like the sound of much water flowing, and like the sound of much thunder. The sound I heard was like people playing music on their harps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.3'>They were singing a new song in front of Gods chief chair, in front of the four living beings and the leaders. No one could learn that song but the one hundred and forty-four thousand people. They have been bought from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.4'>They are the people who have not had sex with women. They are clean. They are the people who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They lived among people on earth. They have been bought from the earth. They are the first among men to have been bought for God and the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.5'>They never told lies. They are found to be without any wrong ways as they stand before the throne of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.6'>Then I saw another angel flying across the sky. He had good news that will last for ever to tell the people who live on the earth. The good news is for every country, tribe,  language, and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.7'>He said in a loud voice, Respect and honour God and give him glory! The time has come for him to judge people, to tell them how good or bad they are. Worship him. He made heaven and earth, the sea, and the rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.8'>A second angel followed him. He said, The great city of Babylon has fallen down. It has fallen down because it filled all the countries with its wrong ways. It has made people to suffer Gods anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.10'>A third angel followed the other two. He said in a loud voice, Any person who worships the beast or its idol, and takes its mark on his forehead or on his hand, will also feel Gods anger. He is very angry. That person will be burned with fire and dust that chokes people when it burns. He will be burned in front of the holy angels and the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.11'>The smoke of that fire goes up for ever and ever. Those who worship the animal and its idol, and anyone who takes the mark of its name, will get no rest day or night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.12'>This is why Gods people must be patient. They are the ones who keep the laws of God and believe in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.13'>I heard a voice from the sky. It said, Write this: From now on, happy are those who die believing in the Lord. Yes, says the Spirit. They will have rest from their troubles. The good things they have done will go with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.14'>I looked and saw a white cloud. I saw someone like the Son of Man sitting on the cloud.  He had a big gold crown on his head and a sharp harvest knife in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.15'>Another angel came out of Gods temple. He called in a loud voice to the one who was sitting on the cloud. He said, Take your knife and cut the harvest. The time has come to take in the harvest because the earth is ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.16'>So the one who sat on the cloud used his knife on earth. And the harvest on earth was cut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.17'>Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven. He also had a sharp knife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.18'>And another angel came from the altar. He had power over fire. He called in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp knife. He said, Take your sharp knife and gather the fruit that grows on the vine on the earth. Its fruit is ripe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.19'>So the angel used his knife on earth. He gathered the fruit of the vine on the earth. He put it in the big place where the water of the fruit is pressed out. This place is Gods anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.20'>It was outside the city that they pressed the fruit. Blood ran out of the place. It came up as high as the horses heads for about two hundred miles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.1'>I saw another big and wonderful thing in the sky. I saw seven angels who carried the seven big troubles. They are the last troubles. When these troubles have come, Gods anger is ended. 2I saw something that looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. And I saw those people who had won the fight against the beast, and its idol, and its mark, and the number of its name. They were standing on the sea of glass and they had the harps of God in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.2'>They sing the song of Moses who is the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb. They say, Lord God who has all power, the things you do are great and wonderful! King for ever, your ways are right and true!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.3'>Who will not respect and honour you and praise your name, Lord? You are the only one who is holy. People from all countries will come and worship you because they have seen that you are right and fair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.4'>After this I looked. The temple in heaven was open. It was the place where Gods agreement was kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.5'>The seven angels who carried the seven troubles came out of the temple. They were wearing linen clothes, clean and shining. Around their chests they wore gold belts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.6'>One of the four living beings gave the angels seven gold bowls. The bowls were full of the anger of God who lives for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.7'>The temple was full of smoke because God is so great and has so much power. No one could go into the temple until the seven troubles, which the seven angels had, were ended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.8'>missing fehlt/missing</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.16'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.1'>I heard a loud voice coming from the temple. It said to the seven angels, Go and pour the seven bowls of Gods anger on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.2'>So the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth. Then a bad, dirty sore came on the people who had the mark of the animal on them, and who worshipped its idol.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.3'>The second angel poured his bowl on the sea. It turned into blood like that of a person who has been killed. Everything in the sea that had life died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.4'>The third angel poured his bowl on the rivers and the places where there was water.  They turned into blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.5'>And I heard the angel of the water say, Holy One, you who live now and who always have lived, and will live for ever; you are right because you have punished them this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.6'>They killed Gods people and the prophets. Now you have given them blood to drink. This is what they should get!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.7'>I heard the people under the altar say, Yes, Lord God, you have all power! The way you punish is true and right!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.8'>The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun. Then the sun was given the power to burn people with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.9'>People were burned because the sun was so hot. And they spoke wrongly about the name of God, cursing him because he had the power to send these troubles. But they would not stop the wrong things they were doing. They would not respect and honour God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.10'>The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast. The place where he ruled became dark. People bit their tongues because of the pain they had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.11'>They cursed God in heaven because of their pain and sores. But they did not stop the wrong things they were doing. They would not turn back to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.12'>The sixth angel poured his bowl on the big river Euphrates. Its water dried up so that a road was made ready for the kings to come from the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.13'>I saw three bad spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the prophet who is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.14'>They are the spirits of gods who are not true, and they do wonderful things. They go to the kings of the whole world and gather them to fight on the great day of God who has all power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.15'>Look! I will come like a thief. The person who stays awake and dressed will be glad he did! He will not be without clothes and he will not be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.16'>They gathered at the place called Armageddon in the Hebrew language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.17'>Then the seventh angel poured his bowl into the air. A loud voice came from the temple and the chair. It said, It is finished!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.18'>There were lightnings, loud noises, and thunder. The earth shook very much. It shook more than it had ever shaken since people have been on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.19'>The big city was broken into three parts. And the cities of the nations fell down. God remembered Babylon, the big city. He made it feel all of his great anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.20'>The islands all went away, and the mountains could not be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.21'>Rain like big stones fell from the sky on men. Each stone weighed about a hundred pounds. Men cursed God because the big rain of stones fell on them. The trouble was very bad.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.17'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.1'>One of the seven angels who had carried the seven bowls came and talked to me. He said, Come, and I will show you the woman who has given herself over to wrong ways of using sex. She is sitting over many waters. I will show you how she will be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.2'>The kings on earth have been with her and copied her. And the people on earth gladly copy her wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.3'>Then the angel took me away in the Spirit to a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting on a red beast that had names against God written all over it. It had seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.4'>The woman was wearing blue and red clothes. She was shining with gold, fine stones,  and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup. It was full of the wrong things she did and of her dirty ways of using sex.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.5'>A name was written on her forehead. It has a secret meaning. The name is Great Babylon, the mother of all people who give their bodies for wrong ways of using sex. The mother of all things done on earth too bad to talk about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.6'>And I saw the woman was drunk because of the blood she drank. It was the blood of Gods people, and the blood of people who had been killed because they belonged to Jesus. When I saw her, I was very much surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.7'>The angel asked me, Why are you surprised? I will tell you the secret meaning of the woman and the beast with seven heads and horns that carries her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.8'>The beast that you saw was alive at one time, then it was dead. It will come up from the big hole that has no bottom and it will be killed. The people on earth will be surprised when they see the beast, because it was alive and then it was dead, and it comes alive again. These are the people who do not have their names written in the book of life from the time the world was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.9'>To understand this, one must be wise. The seven heads are the seven hills on which the woman is sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.10'>They are also seven kings. Five have already lost their power. One is ruling now, and the other one has not yet come. When he comes he will rule for a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.11'>The beast that was alive at the one time, and then was dead, is the eighth king. He is really one of the seven. He will be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.12'>The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet ruled. They will have power for one hour to rule with the animal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.13'>These ten all think the same way, and they give to the beast their power and right to rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.14'>They will fight against the Lamb, but the Lamb will win the fight against them. He will win because he is Lord of lords and King of kings. Those who are with the Lamb will also win. God has called them and chosen them, and they believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.15'>And the angel said to me, You saw the water on which the bad woman is sitting. The water is the many nations, many people, many countries, and many languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.16'>You saw the ten horns and the animal. They will hate the bad woman. They will take away everything she has and her fine clothes. They will eat her body and burn her up in a fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.17'>God has put it into their hearts to do what he wants done to her. They will all agree. They will give to the beast their power to rule until what God has said comes true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.18'>The woman whom you saw is the big city that rules over the kings on earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.18'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.1'>After that I saw another angel coming down from the sky. He had much power. The bright light that shone from him lit up the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.2'>He called in a loud voice and said, The big city of Babylon has fallen down! It has fallen down! Bad spirits live in it. All bad spirits hide there. And all kinds of dirty birds that people hate hide there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.3'>All the nations are broken down because they are full of its wrong ways. The kings of the earth have joined with it. The traders of the earth have become rich because of its wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.4'>Then I heard another voice from the sky that said, Come out of it, my people, so that you will have no part in the wrong things it does. Come out of it so that you will not have the big troubles it will have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.5'>Its wrong ways are piled as high as the sky and God has remembered the wrong things it has done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.6'>Do to it what it did to you. Yes, do two times as much to it as it did to you! From the cup it gave you to drink, give it two times as much to drink as it gave to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.7'>It is proud of itself and has done wrong things. Give it that much trouble and crying. It says in its heart, "I am like a queen. I am not like a woman who has lost her husband. I will never know sorrow."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.8'>So then, its big troubles will come in one day. Those troubles are death, crying, hunger,  and being burned in a fire. The Lord who has punished it is strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.9'>And the kings of the earth were joined with it in its wrong ways. They will cry and be sad about it when they see the smoke while it burns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.10'>They will stand far away from it because they are afraid of the trouble it is having. They will say, "Trouble! Trouble! You big, strong city Babylon! In one hour your punishment has come!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.11'>And the traders of the earth will cry and be sad about it, because no one buys the things they bring to sell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.12'>They have many things to sell: gold, silver, fine stones, and pearls. They have linen clothes and blue cloth, silk cloth and red cloth. They have all kinds of sweet smelling wood. They have all kinds of things made of ivory. They have all kinds of things made of wood that costs much money, of brass, of iron, and of a stone called marble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.13'>They have spices and perfume. They have incense and a sweet-smelling oil. They have frankincense and wine and oil. They have fine flour and wheat. They have cows, sheep,  horses, and wagons. They have slaves and people to sell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.14'>The things that your heart wanted are gone from you. All your fine food and clothes are gone from you. You will never find them again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.15'>The traders will sell these things and got much money from the city. They will stand far away from it because they are afraid of the trouble it is having. They will cry and be sad about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.16'>They will say "How terrible for you, you big strong city! You were wearing linen clothes and purple and red clothes. You were shining with gold, fine stones, and pearls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.17'>In one hour all your great riches are lost." And all the captains of the boats and all the seamen, the sailors, and all that do business on the sea stood away from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.18'>They called out loud when they saw the smoke while it burned. They said, "What city is like that big city?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.19'>They threw dust on their heads and they called out loud. They cried and were sad. They said, "How terrible for that big city! All the men who had boats on the sea became rich because it was rich. In one hour it is all lost."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.20'>Be glad for what has happened to it, all you who are in heaven, Gods people, apostles and prophets. God has punished it for what it did to you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.21'>Then a strong angel took up a very heavy stone and threw it into the sea. He said, So hard will Babylon the big city be thrown down. It will not be seen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.22'>People will not hear music in you again. No harps, no singing, no pipes or horns will ever be heard in you again. No one will make things in you again. The noise of people grinding grain will not be heard in you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.23'>No lamp will shine in you again. No one will hear the voice of people being married.  Your traders were the big people of the world. All the countries were fooled by your witch doctors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.24'>The blood of prophets and of Gods people and of all who have been killed on earth was found in that city.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.19'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.1'>After this I heard a loud sound in heaven. It sounded like many people calling. They said,  Praise our God! He saves people. He is great and power belongs to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.2'>The way God punishes is true and right. He has punished the bad woman who spoiled the earth with her wrong ways. He has made her pay for the killing of his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.3'>They said again, Praise God! The smoke where she burns goes up for ever and ever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.4'>Then the twenty-four leaders and the four living beings kneeled down. They worshipped God who was sitting on his throne, and they said, Amen! Yes, it is so! Praise God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.5'>A voice from the throne said, Praise our God, all his servants, all who respect and honour him: you who are great and you who are not great, praise him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.6'>Then I heard a sound in heaven. It sounded like many people and much water flowing and like loud thunder. They said, Praise God! The Lord our God, who has all power,  rules!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.7'>We will be glad and very happy! We will praise him. The time has come for the Lamb to marry. The woman who will marry him is ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.8'>She was given the right to wear fine linen, shining and clean. The fine linen means the good things Gods people have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.9'>The angel said to me, Write this: God blesses those who are called to come to the wedding feast of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true words of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.10'>Then I kneeled down in front of him to worship him. But he said to me, You must not do that! I am only a servant like you and like your brothers who tell about Jesus. Worship God! Those who tell about Jesus have the spirit of a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.11'>Then I saw heaven open, and I saw a white horse! The One who rode him is called One who can be Trusted and The True One.He punishes and makes war in the right way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.12'>His eyes were like a flame of fire. On his head were many crowns. He had a name written on him, but no man knew what it was but he himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.13'>He wore clothes that had been dipped in blood. His name is The Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.14'>The armies of heaven followed him on white horses and they were dressed in fine linen,  shining and clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.15'>A long knife or sword comes from his mouth. With it he will punish and control the people of the nations. He will rule them with an iron stick. He is like the winepress that presses the water out of the fruit. It is the place where God, who has all power, shows his great anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.16'>A name is written on his clothes and on his leg: it is King of kings, and Lord of lords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.17'>I saw an angel standing in the sun. He called in a loud voice to all the birds that fly across the sky. He said, Come, gather for Gods big feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.18'>Come to eat the bodies of kings, the bodies of captains, the bodies of strong men, the bodies of horses and those who ride them, the bodies of all free men and of slaves, those who are great and those who are not great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.19'>I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies. They were gathered to fight against the One riding the horse and his army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.20'>Then the beast was caught and the prophet who is not true was caught. The prophet had done big works for the beast to see. By the things which he did, he had fooled the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshipped its idol. The beast and the prophet were thrown alive into the big fire which burns with dust that chokes people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.21'>Their armies were killed by the man riding the horse. He killed them with the sword that came out of his mouth. All the birds ate all they wanted of their dead bodies.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.20'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.1'>Then I saw an angel coming down from the sky. In his hand he had the key to the big hole that has no bottom, and a big chain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.2'>He caught the dragon, that old snake who is called the devil and Satan. The angel tied him for a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.3'>Then the angel threw him into the big hole that has no bottom. He shut it and locked him in. He did this so that the devil would not fool the nations again until the end of the thousand years. After that, the devil will be let free for a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.4'>Then I saw thrones. Those who sat on them were given the right to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had their heads cut off because they told about Jesus and Gods word.  They had not worshipped the beast or its idol. And they had not taken its mark on their foreheads or on their hands. They became alive again and ruled with Christ for a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.5'>The other dead people did not live again until the end of the thousand years. This is the first rising from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.6'>God has blessed those who rise this first time, and they are holy. They will not die the second kind of death. But they will be priests of God and of Christ. They will rule with him for the thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.7'>When the end of the thousand years comes, Satan will be set free from his prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.8'>He will go out to fool the nations all over the world. He will fool Gog and Magog. He will gather them to fight. They are many, as many as the sand on the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.9'>They marched far over the earth. They went all around the camp of Gods people and the city his people loved. Then fire came down from the sky and burned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.10'>The devil who fooled them was thrown into the big fire which burns with dust that chokes people. The animal, and the prophet who is not true, were already in the fire. They will have a very hard time day and night, for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.11'>Then I saw a big white throne and the person sitting on it. The earth and sky went away from him. They were not there any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.12'>I saw the dead people, those who were great and those not great. They were standing in front of Gods throne. Some books were opened. And another book was opened which is the book of life. The dead people were judged by the things they had done, which were written in the books.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.13'>The dead people in the sea came out. People came out of death and the world of the dead. One by one, each one was judged by the things he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.14'>Then death and the world of the dead were thrown into the big fire. This fire is the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.15'>Every person whose name was not written in the book of life was thrown into this big fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.21.1'>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The first heaven and the first earth had gone away. There was no sea any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.2'>I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. It was all ready and waiting, like a woman dressed for her wedding and ready to meet her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.3'>I heard a loud voice in heaven. It said, Look! Gods house is now set up among the people. God will live with them. They will be his people and God himself will be with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.4'>He will wipe every tear from their eyes. No one will die. No one will ever cry or be sad for any reason. No one will ever have trouble. The old things are gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.5'>The One who sat on the throne said, Look, I make all things new. And he said, Write this, because these words can be trusted. they are true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.6'>He said to me, It is finished! I am the First and the Last! I am the Beginning and the End.  I will give the river of water that gives life to those who are thirsty. It will cost no money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.7'>The one who wins will have these things. I will be his God and he will be my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.8'>Some people will be thrown into the big fire which burns with sulphur dust that chokes people. These are the people: those who give in to fear, those who do not believe, those who are bad, those who kill, those with wrong ways of using sex, the witch-doctors,  those who worship idols, and all those who love lies. That fire is the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.9'>Then one of the seven angels who carried the seven bowls full of the last troubles came and talked to me. He said, Come, I will show you the young woman who is the wife of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.10'>The angel took me away in the Spirit to a very big hill. He showed me Jerusalem, the holy city, coming down out of heaven from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.11'>The light of God was shining from it. It was bright like a very fine stone called jasper. It was as clear as glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.12'>The city had a wall that was big and high. It had twelve doors. At the doors were twelve angels. Names were written on the doors. They are the names of the twelve tribes of the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.13'>There were three doors on the east side. There were three doors on the north side. There were three doors on the south side and three doors on the west side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.14'>The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones. On them were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.15'>The angel who talked to me had a gold stick to measure the city, its doors, and its walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.16'>The city is square. It is as long as it is wide. The angel measured the city with his stick and it was about fifteen hundred miles. It is as long as it is wide and as high as it is long.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.17'>Then he measured its wall. It was two hundred and sixteen feet by the way a man measures. That is the way the angel measured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.18'>The wall of the city was made of a very fine stone called jasper. The city was all made of pure gold. It was clear like glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.19'>The bottom of the city wall was covered with all kinds of fine stones. The first stone was red jasper. The second stone was blue sapphire. The third stone was of many colours called agate. The fourth stone was green emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.20'>The fifth stone was onyx. The sixth stone was red carnelian. The seventh stone was green crysolite. The eighth stone was green beryl. The ninth stone was yellow topaz. The tenth stone was green chrysoprase. The eleventh stone was red jacinth. And the twelfth stone was a blue amethyst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.21'>The twelve doors were twelve pearls. Each door was made from one big pearl. The street of the city was all pure gold. It was as clear as glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.22'>I did not see any temple in the city. The Lord God, who has all power, and the Lamb, are its temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.23'>The city does not need the sun or the moon to give light in it. The glory of God gives light,  and the Lamb is its lamp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.24'>Those who are saved will walk in its light. The kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.25'>The doors of the city will never be shut in the day time, and there will be no night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.26'>The glory and the honour of all nations will be brought into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.27'>Nothing that is not holy will ever go in. People who do wrong things and tell lies will never go in. Only those whose names are written in the Lambs book of life will go in.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.22'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.1'>Then the angel showed me a river of the water which gives life. It was as clear as glass. It flows from the throne of God and the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.2'>It flows through the middle of the street of the city. On each side of the river is the tree which gives life. It has twelve kinds of fruit, and it bears its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree could heal the people of all nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.3'>Nothing that God hates will be in the city any more. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be there. And his servants will serve him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.4'>They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.5'>There will be no night there. They do not need the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun.  The Lord God will give them light. They will rule for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.6'>Then the angel said to me, These words can be trusted. They are true. The Lord God who gave his Spirit to the prophets has sent his angel to show his servants what must happen soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.7'>Look! I will come soon! God will bless the person who obeys the words in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.8'>I, John, heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them I kneeled down to worship in front of the angel who showed them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.9'>But He said to me, You must not do that. I am only a servant like you and your brothers,  the prophets, and those who obey the words of this book. Worship God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.10'>The angel said to me, Do not keep secret the words of Gods message in this book. The time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.11'>Let the bad man keep on doing wrong things. Let the person who does dirty things, keep on being dirty. Let the good person keep on doing what is good. Let the holy person keep on being holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.12'>Look, I will come soon! When I come, I will pay every man for what he has done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.13'>I am the First and the Last. I am the Beginning and the End.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.14'>God will bless the people who do what he says and keep themselves pure and clean.  They can eat fruit from the tree that gives life. And they can go through the doors into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.15'>Outside the city are the dirty people, and the witch-doctors, and those with wrong ways of using sex, those who kill people, those who worship idols, and all those who like lies and tell them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.16'>I, Jesus, have sent my angel to tell these things to you in the churches. I am the root and the branch of David. I am the bright star in the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.17'>The Spirit and the Lambs wife say, Come. He who hears should say, Come. He who is thirsty should come. Anyone who wishes should drink the water that gives life. It costs no money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.18'>I am talking to everyone who hears the words of Gods message in this book. If any one adds anything to this book, God will add to him the troubles that are written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.19'>If any one takes away any of the words of Gods message, God will take away from him his share of the tree which gives life and the holy city. This book tells about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.20'>He who shows these things says, Yes, I will come soon. Amen, Lord Jesus, come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.21'>May the love and mercy of the Lord Jesus bless you all. Amen.</verse>
