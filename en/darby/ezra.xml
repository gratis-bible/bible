        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.1'>And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he made a proclamation throughout his kingdom, and also in writing, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.2'>Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth has Jehovah the God of the heavens given to me, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.9'>And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine-and-twenty knives,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.1'>And when the seventh month came, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.2'>Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer up burnt-offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.3'>And they set the altar on its base; for fear was upon them because of the people of the countries; and they offered up burnt-offerings on it to Jehovah, the morning and evening burnt-offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.4'>And they held the feast of tabernacles as it is written, and [offered] daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.5'>and afterwards the continual burnt-offering, and those of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Jehovah that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a voluntary offering to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.6'>From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer up burnt-offerings to Jehovah. But the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was not [yet] laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.7'>And they gave money to the masons and to the carpenters; and meat and drink and oil to the Zidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.8'>And in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and they appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to superintend the work of the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.9'>And Jeshua stood up, his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, as one [man], to superintend the workmen in the house of God; [also] the sons of Henadad, their sons and their brethren, the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.10'>And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel, with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise Jehovah according to the directions of David king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.11'>And they sang alternately together in praising and giving thanks to Jehovah: For he is good, for his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout to the praise of Jehovah, because the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'>But many of the priests and Levites and chief fathers, the ancient men that had seen the first house, wept with a loud voice, [when] the foundation of this house was laid in their sight; and many shouted aloud for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'>And the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a great shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.1'>And the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building the temple to Jehovah the God of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'>and they came to Zerubbabel and to the chief fathers, and said to them, We would build with you; for we seek your God, as ye; and we have sacrificed to him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the chief fathers of Israel said to them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God, but we alone will build to Jehovah the God of Israel, as king Cyrus, the king of Persia, has commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'>And the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.5'>and they hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.6'>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.7'>And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in Aramaic, and interpreted in Aramaic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.8'>Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king after this sort:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.9'>Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.10'>and the rest of the peoples whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over and settled in the cities of Samaria, and the rest [of the country] on this side the river, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.11'>This is the copy of the letter that they sent to him: To Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men on this side the river, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.12'>Be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from thee unto us have come to Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and they complete the walls and join up the foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'>Be it known therefore unto the king, that, if this city be built and the walls be completed, they will not pay tribute, tax, and toll, and in the end it will bring damage to the kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'>Now, since we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not right for us to see the king's injury, therefore have we sent and informed the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.15'>that search may be made in the book of the annals of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the annals and know that this city is a rebellious city, which has done damage to kings and provinces, and that they have raised sedition within the same of old time, for which cause this city was destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'>We inform the king that if this city be built and its walls be completed, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'>The king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and the other places beyond the river: Peace, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'>The letter that ye sent to us has been read before me distinctly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'>And I gave orders, and search has been made, and it has been found that this city of old time has made insurrection against the kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been raised therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.20'>And there have been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all beyond the river; and tribute, tax, and toll were paid to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.21'>Now give order to make these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until the order shall be given from me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.22'>and take heed that ye fail not to do this: why should harm grow to the damage of the kings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.23'>As soon as the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them cease by force and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.24'>Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.1'>Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel [did they prophesy] to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.2'>Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, who helped them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.3'>At that time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar-boznai, and their companions, and said thus to them: Who gave you orders to build this house and to complete this wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.4'>And they said to them after this manner: What are the names of the men that build this building?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.5'>But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease till the matter came to Darius; and then they returned answer by letter concerning it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.6'>The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were on this side the river, sent to Darius the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.7'>They sent a report to him in which was written thus: To Darius the king, all peace!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.8'>Be it known to the king that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is being built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work is being carried on with diligence, and prospers in their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.9'>Then asked we those elders: thus we said to them, Who gave you orders to build this house and to complete this wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.10'>We asked their names also, to inform thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.11'>And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of the heavens and the earth, and build the house that was built these many years ago; and a great king of Israel built and completed it.</verse>
