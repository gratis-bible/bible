      <chapter osisID='2Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.1'>And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, that David abode two days in Ziklag.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.2'>And it came to pass on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his garments rent, and earth upon his head; and as soon as he came to David, he fell to the earth and did obeisance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.3'>And David said to him, Whence comest thou? And he said to him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.4'>And David said to him, What has taken place? I pray thee, tell me. And he said that the people had fled from the battle, and many of the people also had fallen and died, and that Saul and Jonathan his son were dead also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.5'>And David said to the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.6'>And the young man that told him said, I happened by chance to be upon mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul leaned on his spear; and behold, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.7'>And he looked behind him, and saw me, and called to me. And I said, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.8'>And he said to me, Who art thou? And I said to him, I am an Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.9'>He said to me again, Stand, I pray thee, over me, and slay me; for anguish has seized me; for my life is yet whole in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.10'>So I stood over him, and put him to death, for I knew that he would not live after his fall; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither to my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.11'>Then David took hold of his garments and rent them; and all the men that were with him [did] likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.12'>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.13'>And David said to the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he said, I am the son of an Amalekite stranger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.14'>And David said to him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah's anointed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.15'>Then David called one of the young men and said, Draw near, [and] fall on him. And he smote him that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.16'>And David said to him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth has testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah's anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.17'>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.18'>and he bade them teach the children of Judah [the song of] the bow. Behold, it is written in the book of Jasher:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.19'>The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.20'>Tell [it] not in Gath, carry not the tidings in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.21'>Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, no rain upon you, nor fields of heave-offerings! For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, [as] not anointed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.22'>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan turned not back, And the sword of Saul returned not empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.23'>Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in their lives, Even in their death were not divided; They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.24'>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet with splendour, Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.25'>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.26'>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant wast thou unto me; Thy love to me was wonderful, passing women's love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.27'>How are the mighty fallen, and the instruments of war perished!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.1'>And it came to pass after this that David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah? And Jehovah said to him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.2'>So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jizreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.3'>And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household; and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.4'>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, It is the men of Jabesh-Gilead that have buried Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.5'>And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead, and said to them, Blessed be ye of Jehovah, that ye have shewn this kindness to your lord, to Saul, and have buried him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.6'>And now Jehovah shew kindness and faithfulness to you; and I also will requite you this good, because ye have done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.7'>And now let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.8'>And Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.9'>and made him king over Gilead, and over the Asshurites, and over Jizreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.10'>Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. However, the house of Judah followed David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.11'>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.12'>And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.13'>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out. And they met together by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, these on the one side of the pool, and those on the other side of the pool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.14'>And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise and make sport before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.15'>And they arose and went over by number, twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.16'>And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and [thrust] his sword in his fellow's side, and they fell down together. And that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is by Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.17'>And the battle that day was very severe; and Abner and the men of Israel were routed before the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.18'>And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was swift of foot, as one of the gazelles that are in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.19'>And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from behind Abner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.20'>Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he said, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.21'>And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside, to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay hold of one of the young men, and take for thyself his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.22'>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: why should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.23'>But he refused to turn aside; therefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the belly, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place. And it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.24'>And Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner; and the sun went down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.25'>And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of a hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.26'>And Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? and how long shall it be ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.27'>And Joab said, [As] God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.28'>And Joab blew the trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither did they fight any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.29'>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.30'>And Joab returned from following Abner, and gathered all the people together; and there lacked of David's servants nineteen men, and Asahel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.31'>And the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, three hundred and sixty men, who had died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.32'>And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.1'>And the war was long between the house of Saul and the house of David; but David became continually stronger, and the house of Saul became continually weaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.2'>And to David were sons born in Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jizreelitess;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.3'>and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maachah, daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.4'>and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.5'>and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.6'>And it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.7'>And Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And [Ishbosheth] said to Abner, Why hast thou gone in to my father's concubine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.8'>Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, I who against Judah do shew kindness this day to the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou reproachest me this day with the fault of this woman?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.9'>So do God to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah has sworn to David, I do not so to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.10'>to translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.11'>And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.12'>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying [also], Make thy covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with thee, to turn all Israel to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.13'>And he said, Well, I will make a covenant with thee; only I require one thing of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.14'>And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.15'>And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from [her] husband, from Phaltiel the son of Laish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.16'>And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner to him, Go, return. And he returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.17'>Now Abner had communicated with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David aforetime to be king over you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.18'>and now do [it], for Jehovah has spoken of David, saying, By my servant David will I save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.19'>And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin; and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.20'>So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a repast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.21'>And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy heart desires. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.22'>And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from an expedition, and brought in a great spoil with them; but Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.23'>And Joab and all the host that was with him came; and they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away; and he is gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.24'>Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came to thee; why is it [that] thou hast sent him away, and he is gone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.25'>Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.26'>And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him again from the well of Sirah; but David did not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.27'>And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him secretly, and smote him there in the belly, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.28'>And afterwards David heard [it], and he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.29'>let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue, or that is a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls by the sword, or that lacks bread!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.30'>So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.31'>And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your garments, and gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.32'>And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.33'>And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dieth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.34'>Thy hands were not bound, Nor thy feet put into fetters; As a man falleth before wicked men, Fellest thou! And all the people wept again over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.35'>And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread or aught else till the sun be down!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.36'>And all the people remarked it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.37'>And all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.38'>And the king said to his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.39'>And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too hard for me: Jehovah reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.1'>And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were enfeebled, and all Israel was troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.2'>And Saul's son had two men, captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin; for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.3'>And the Beerothites had fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.4'>And Jonathan Saul's son had a son that was lame of [his] feet. He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jizreel; and his nurse took him up and fled. And it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.5'>And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went and came in about the heat of the day into the house of Ishbosheth, who was taking his noonday rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.6'>And they came thither into the midst of the house, [as though] they would fetch wheat; and they smote him in the belly; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.7'>They came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him; and they took his head, and went by the way of the plain all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.8'>And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David in Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, thine enemy who sought thy life; and Jehovah has given to my lord the king to be avenged this day of Saul and of his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.9'>Then David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, [As] Jehovah liveth, who has redeemed my soul out of all distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.10'>when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead! and he was in his own sight a messenger of good, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag to whom forsooth I should give a reward for his good tidings:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.11'>how much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? and should I not now demand his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.12'>And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged [them] up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.1'>Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.2'>Even aforetime, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel; and Jehovah said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.3'>And all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah; and they anointed David king over Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.5'>And Jonadab said to him, Lay thee down on thy bed and feign thyself sick; and when thy father comes to see thee, say to him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me food, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.6'>So Amnon lay down and feigned himself sick; and the king came to see him, and Amnon said to the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.7'>And David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go, I pray thee, to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.29'>And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and they rode each upon his mule and fled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.2'>And Absalom rose early, and stood beside the way of the gate; and it was so, that when any man who had a controversy had to come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.3'>And Absalom said to him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man to hear thee [appointed] by the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.4'>And Absalom said, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any controversy and cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.5'>And it was so, that when any man came near to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.6'>And in this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment; and Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.7'>And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said to the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay in Hebron my vow which I have vowed to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.8'>For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode in Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.9'>And the king said to him, Go in peace. And he rose up and went to Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.10'>And Absalom sent emissaries into all the tribes of Israel, saying, When ye hear the sound of the trumpet, ye shall say, Absalom reigns in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.11'>And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.12'>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, from Giloh, while he offered the sacrifices. And the conspiracy gathered strength; and the people increased continually with Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.13'>And there came one to David who reported saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.14'>And David said to all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Rise up and let us flee; for we shall not [else] escape from Absalom. Be quick to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.15'>And the king's servants said to the king, Behold, thy servants [will do] whatever my lord the king shall choose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.16'>And the king went forth, and all his household after him, and the king left ten women, concubines, to keep the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.17'>And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and stayed at the remote house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.18'>And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed over before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.19'>And the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why dost thou also go with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king; for thou art a foreigner, and besides, thou hast emigrated to the place where thou [dwellest].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.20'>Thou didst come yesterday, and should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I can? Return and take back thy brethren. Mercy and truth be with thee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.21'>And Ittai answered the king and said, [As] Jehovah liveth, and [as] my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.22'>And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.23'>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over; the king also himself passed over the torrent Kidron, and all the people passed over, towards the way of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.24'>And behold, Zadok also, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had passed completely out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.25'>And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city. If I shall find favour in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again, and shew me it, and its habitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.26'>But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, [here am] I, let him do to me as seemeth good to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.27'>And the king said to Zadok the priest, Thou art the seer: return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.28'>See, I will stop in the plains of the desert, until there come word from you to inform me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.29'>And Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem; and they abode there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.30'>But David went up by the ascent of the Olives, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot; and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.31'>And one told David saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. Then said David, Jehovah, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.32'>And it came to pass, when David had come to the summit, where he worshipped God, that behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.33'>And David said to him, If thou passest on with me, thou wilt be a burden to me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.34'>but if thou return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so now will I be thy servant; then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.35'>And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? and it shall be, [that] whatsoever thing thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.36'>Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's [son], and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send to me everything that ye shall hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.37'>And Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.16'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.1'>And when David was a little past the summit, behold, Ziba, Mephibosheth's servant, met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred [loaves] of bread, and a hundred raisin-cakes, and a hundred cakes of summer fruits, and a flask of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.2'>And the king said to Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruits for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.3'>And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.4'>And the king said to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained to Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly bow myself: may I find favour in thy sight, my lord, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.5'>And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out from thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.6'>and cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.7'>And thus said Shimei as he cursed: Away, away, thou man of blood and man of Belial!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.8'>Jehovah has returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah has given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and behold, thou art [taken] in thine own evil, for thou art a man of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.9'>And Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.10'>And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, for Jehovah has said to him, Curse David! Who shall then say, Why dost thou so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.11'>And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth of my bowels, seeks my life: how much more now a Benjaminite? let him alone and let him curse; for Jehovah has bidden him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.12'>It may be that Jehovah will look on mine affliction, and that Jehovah will requite me good for my being cursed this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.13'>And David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.14'>And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.15'>Now Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.16'>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, Long live the king! Long live the king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.17'>And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why didst thou not go with thy friend?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.18'>And Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.19'>And again, whom should I serve? should it not be in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.20'>And Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.21'>And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to thy father's concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art become odious with thy father; and the hands of all that are with thee shall be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.22'>So they spread a tent for Absalom upon the roof; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.23'>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had inquired of the word of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.17'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.1'>And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me, I pray, choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David to-night;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.2'>and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.3'>and I will bring back all the people to thee. The man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: all the people shall be in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.4'>And the saying was right in the eyes of Absalom, and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.5'>And Absalom said, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and we will hear also what he says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.6'>And Hushai came to Absalom, and Absalom spoke to him saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner: shall we carry out his word? If not, speak thou.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.7'>And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.8'>And Hushai said, Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are of exasperated spirit, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.9'>Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or some such place; and it will come to pass, when some of them fall at the first, whoever heareth it will say, There has been slaughter among the people that follow Absalom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.10'>and even the valiant man whose heart is as the heart of a lion shall utterly melt; for all Israel knows that thy father is a mighty man, and they that are with him are valiant men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.11'>But I counsel that all Israel be speedily gathered to thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.12'>And we shall come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.13'>And if he withdraw into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the torrent, until there be not one small stone found there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.14'>And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. And Jehovah had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, in order that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.15'>And Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.16'>And now send quickly, and tell David saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.17'>And Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; and the maid went and told them; and they went and told king David, for they might not be seen to come into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.18'>But a lad saw them, and told Absalom. Then they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man at Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.19'>And the woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn on it; and the thing was not known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.20'>And Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, and said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, They have gone over the brook of water. And they sought and could not find [them], and returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.21'>And it came to pass after they had departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counselled against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.22'>Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan; by the morning light there was not one of them missing that had not gone over the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.23'>And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose and went to his house, to his city, and gave charge to his household, and hanged himself, and he died; and he was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.24'>And David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.25'>And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab; which Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Jithra the Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.26'>And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.27'>And as soon as David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.28'>brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched [corn], and beans, and lentils, and parched [pulse],</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.29'>and honey, and cream, and sheep, and cheese of kine to David, and to the people that were with him, to eat; for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty in the wilderness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.18'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.1'>And David marshalled the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.2'>And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.3'>But the people said, Thou shalt not go forth, for if we should in any case flee, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us; for *thou* art worth ten thousand of us; and now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.4'>And the king said to them, I will do what is good in your sight. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.5'>And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, [Deal] gently for my sake with the young man Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.6'>And the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.7'>And the people of Israel were routed before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day: twenty thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.8'>And the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.9'>And Absalom found himself in the presence of David's servants. And Absalom was riding upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of the great terebinth, and his head caught in the terebinth, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.10'>And a man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.11'>And Joab said to the man that told him, And behold, thou sawest [him], and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten silver pieces and a girdle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.12'>And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand silver pieces in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Take care, whoever it be [of you], of the young man Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.13'>Or I should have acted falsely against mine own life, for there is no matter concealed from the king, and thou wouldest have set thyself against [me].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.14'>Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three spears in his hand, and thrust them into Absalom's body, while he was yet alive in the midst of the terebinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.15'>And ten young men that bore Joab's armour surrounded and smote Absalom, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.16'>And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab kept back the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.17'>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and raised a very great heap of stones upon him. And all Israel fled every one to his tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.18'>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a monument, which is in the king's dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance; and he called the monument after his own name; and it is called unto this day, Absalom's memorial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.19'>And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, Let me run, I pray, and carry the king the news that Jehovah has avenged him of his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.20'>And Joab said to him, Thou shalt not be a bearer of news to-day, but thou shalt carry the news another day; but to-day thou shalt carry no news, because the king's son is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.21'>Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And the Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.22'>And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, Come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Why wilt thou run, my son, seeing that there is no news suited [to thee]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.23'>But, come what may, let me run. And he said to him, Run. And Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outstripped the Cushite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.24'>And David sat between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate, on to the wall, and lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man running alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.25'>And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is news in his mouth. And he came on and drew near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.26'>And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the porter and said, Behold a man running alone. And the king said, He also is a bearer of news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.27'>And the watchman said, I see the running of the foremost like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man; and comes with good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.28'>And Ahimaaz called and said to the king, Peace! And he fell down to the earth on his face before the king, and said, Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who has delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.29'>And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz said, I saw a great tumult when Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant; but I knew not what it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.30'>And the king said, Turn aside [and] stand here. And he turned aside and stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.31'>And behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, Let my lord the king receive good tidings, for Jehovah has avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.32'>And the king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite said, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee for evil, be as that young man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.25'>And David built there an altar to Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. And Jehovah was propitious to the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</verse>
