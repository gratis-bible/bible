I [am] Jehovah, and there is none else;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>forming the light and creating darkness, making peace and creating evil: I, Jehovah, do all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Drop down, [ye] heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and with it let righteousness spring up. I, Jehovah, have created it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let a potsherd [strive] with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that formeth it, What makest thou? Or thy work, He hath no hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Woe unto him that saith unto [his] father, What begettest thou? Or to [his] mother, What hast thou brought forth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus saith Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask me of the things to come; concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It is I that have made the earth, and created man upon it; it is I, my hands, that have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>It is I that have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make all his ways straight: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith Jehovah of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus saith Jehovah: The wealth of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall walk after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall bow down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, [saying,] Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, no other God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them; they shall go away in confusion together, the makers of idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Israel shall be saved by Jehovah with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded, unto the ages of ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus saith Jehovah who created the heavens, God himself who formed the earth and made it, he who established it, not as waste did he create it: he formed it to be inhabited: I [am] Jehovah, and there is none else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth; I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek me in vain: I [am] Jehovah, speaking righteousness, declaring things which are right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Gather yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations. They have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a God that cannot save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Declare and bring [them] near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath caused this to be heard from ancient time? [who] hath declared it long ago? Is it not I, Jehovah? And there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour, there is none besides me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I [am] God, and there is none else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth [in] righteousness and shall not return, that unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Only in Jehovah, shall one say, have I righteousness and strength. To him shall [men] come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
