      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In [the] beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>*He* was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things received being through him, and without him not one [thing] received being which has received being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light appears in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man sent from God, his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>He came for witness, that he might witness concerning the light, that all might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>*He* was not the light, but that he might witness concerning the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>The true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world had [its] being through him, and the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own, and his own received him not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>but as many as received him, to them gave he [the] right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>(John bears witness of him, and he has cried, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>for of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites that they might ask him, Thou, who art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he acknowledged and denied not, and acknowledged, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he says, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>They said therefore to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said, I [am] [the] voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the path of [the] Lord, as said Esaias the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>And they were sent from among the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him and said to him, Why baptisest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them saying, I baptise with water. In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things took place in Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptising.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he *was* before me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>and I knew him not; but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Again, on the morrow, there stood John and two of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>And, looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And the two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>But Jesus having turned, and seeing them following, says to them, What seek ye? And *they* said to him, Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He says to them, Come and see. They went therefore, and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard [this] from John and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messias (which being interpreted is Christ).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>And he led him to Jesus. Jesus looking at him said, Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas (which interpreted is stone).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>On the morrow he would go forth into Galilee, and Jesus finds Philip, and says to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold [one] truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael says to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And he says to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And on the third day a marriage took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>And Jesus also, and his disciples, were invited to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And wine being deficient, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus says to her, What have I to do with thee, woman? mine hour has not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother says to the servants, Whatever he may say to you, do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now there were standing there six stone water-vessels, according to the purification of the Jews, holding two or three measures each.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus says to them, Fill the water-vessels with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And he says to them, Draw out now, and carry [it] to the feast-master. And they carried [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>But when the feast-master had tasted the water which had been made wine (and knew not whence it was, but the servants knew who drew the water), the feast-master calls the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and says to him, Every man sets on first the good wine, and when [men] have well drunk, then the inferior; thou hast kept the good wine till now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he descended to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples; and there they abode not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And he found in the temple the sellers of oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>and, having made a scourge of cords, he cast [them] all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the change of the money-changers, and overturned the tables,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>and said to the sellers of doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>[And] his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thy house devours me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>The Jews therefore answered and said to him, What sign shewest thou to us, that thou doest these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple building, and thou wilt raise it up in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But *he* spoke of the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>When therefore he was raised from among [the] dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>And when he was in Jerusalem, at the passover, at the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he wrought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew all [men],</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and that he had not need that any should testify of man, for himself knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>But there was a man from among the Pharisees, his name Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>he came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art come a teacher from God, for none can do these signs that thou doest unless God be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be born being old? can he enter a second time into the womb of his mother and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Do not wonder that I said to thee, It is needful that *ye* should be born anew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes: thus is every one that is born of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered and said to him, Thou art the teacher of Israel and knowest not these things!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and we bear witness of that which we have seen, and ye receive not our witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I have said the earthly things to you, and ye believe not, how, if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>And no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>that every one who believes on him may [not perish, but] have life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God has not sent his Son into the world that he may judge the world, but that the world may be saved through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He that believes on him is not judged: but he that believes not has been already judged, because he has not believed on the name of the only-begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the judgment, that light is come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light; for their works were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For every one that does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light that his works may not be shewn as they are;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>but he that practises the truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested that they have been wrought in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he abode with them and baptised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>And John also was baptising in Aenon, near Salim, because there was a great deal of water there; and they came to [him] and were baptised:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>for John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>There was therefore a reasoning of the disciples of John with a Jew about purification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, he baptises, and all come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He that has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices in heart because of the voice of the bridegroom: this my joy then is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, but I must decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He who comes from above is above all. He who has his origin in the earth is of the earth, and speaks [as] of the earth. He who comes out of heaven is above all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>[and] what he has seen and has heard, this he testifies; and no one receives his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>for he whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives not the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things [to be] in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He that believes on the Son has life eternal, and he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus makes and baptises more disciples than John</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(however, Jesus himself did not baptise, but his disciples),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Judaea and went away again unto Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>And he must needs pass through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>He comes therefore to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near to the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Now a fountain of Jacob's was there; Jesus therefore, being wearied with the way he had come, sat just as he was at the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>A woman comes out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus says to her, Give me to drink</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>(for his disciples had gone away into the city that they might buy provisions).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>The Samaritan woman therefore says to him, How dost thou, being a Jew, ask to drink of me who am a Samaritan woman? for Jews have no intercourse with Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman says to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou the living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered and said to her, Every one who drinks of this water shall thirst again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst for ever, but the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman says to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst nor come here to draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus says to her, Go, call thy husband, and come here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered and said, I have not a husband. Jesus says to her, Thou hast well said, I have not a husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for thou hast had five husbands, and he whom now thou hast is not thy husband: this thou hast spoken truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman says to him, Sir, I see that thou art a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, [the] hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>Ye worship ye know not what; we worship what we know, for salvation is of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But [the] hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such as his worshippers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God [is] a spirit; and they who worship him must worship [him] in spirit and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman says to him, I know that Messias is coming, who is called Christ; when *he* comes he will tell us all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus says to her, I who speak to thee am [he].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And upon this came his disciples, and wondered that he spoke with a woman; yet no one said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>The woman then left her waterpot and went away into the city, and says to the men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They went out of the city and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>But meanwhile the disciples asked him saying, Rabbi, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said to them, I have food to eat which ye do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>The disciples therefore said to one another, Has any one brought him [anything] to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus says to them, My food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me, and that I should finish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Do not ye say, that there are yet four months and the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and behold the fields, for they are already white to harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>He that reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto life eternal, that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For in this is [verified] the true saying, It is one who sows and another who reaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I have sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured; others have laboured, and ye have entered into their labours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>But many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him because of the word of the woman who bore witness, He told me all things that I had ever done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>When therefore the Samaritans came to him they asked him to abide with them, and he abode there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And more a great deal believed on account of his word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>and they said to the woman, [It is] no longer on account of thy saying that we believe, for we have heard him ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>But after the two days he went forth thence and went away into Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>for Jesus himself bore witness that a prophet has no honour in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem during the feast, for they also went to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain courtier in Capernaum whose son was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>He, having heard that Jesus had come out of Judaea into Galilee, went to him and asked [him] that he would come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jesus therefore said to him, Unless ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The courtier says to him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus says to him, Go, thy son lives. And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>But already, as he was going down, his servants met him and brought [him] word saying, Thy child lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>He inquired therefore from them the hour at which he got better. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>The father therefore knew that [it was] in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son lives; and he believed, himself and his whole house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This second sign again did Jesus, being come out of Judaea into Galilee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After these things was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is in Jerusalem, at the sheepgate, a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a multitude of sick, blind, lame, withered, [awaiting the moving of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>For an angel descended at a certain season in the pool and troubled the water. Whoever therefore first went in after the troubling of the water became well, whatever disease he laboured under.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>But there was a certain man there who had been suffering under his infirmity thirty and eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>Jesus seeing this [man] lying [there], and knowing that he was [in that state] now a great length of time, says to him, Wouldest thou become well?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The infirm [man] answered him, Sir, I have not a man, in order, when the water has been troubled, to cast me into the pool; but while I am coming another descends before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy couch and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And immediately the man became well, and took up his couch and walked: and on that day was sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>The Jews therefore said to the healed [man], It is sabbath, it is not permitted thee to take up thy couch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered them, He that made me well, *he* said to me, Take up thy couch and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>They asked him [therefore], Who is the man who said to thee, Take up thy couch and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But he that had been healed knew not who it was, for Jesus had slidden away, there being a crowd in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>After these things Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art become well: sin no more, that something worse do not happen to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus [and sought to kill him], because he had done these things on sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto and I work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he had not only violated the sabbath, but also said that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself save whatever he sees the Father doing: for whatever things *he* does, these things also the Son does in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son and shews him all things which he himself does; and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For even as the Father raises the dead and quickens [them], thus the Son also quickens whom he will:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>for neither does the Father judge any one, but has given all judgment to the Son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>that all may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He who honours not the Son, honours not the Father who has sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that he that hears my word, and believes him that has sent me, has life eternal, and does not come into judgment, but is passed out of death into life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that an hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that have heard shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For even as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son also to have life in himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>and has given him authority to execute judgment [also], because he is Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Wonder not at this, for an hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and shall go forth; those that have practised good, to resurrection of life, and those that have done evil, to resurrection of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I cannot do anything of myself; as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous, because I do not seek my will, but the will of him that has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>It is another who bears witness concerning me, and I know that the witness which he bears concerning me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>Ye have sent unto John, and he has borne witness to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But I do not receive witness from man, but I say this that *ye* might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>*He* was the burning and shining lamp, and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have the witness [that is] greater than [that] of John; for the works which the Father has given me that I should complete them, the works themselves which I do, bear witness concerning me that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father who has sent me himself has borne witness concerning me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor have seen his shape,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>and ye have not his word abiding in you; for whom *he* hath sent, him ye do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>Ye search the scriptures, for ye think that in them ye have life eternal, and they it is which bear witness concerning me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>and ye will not come to me that ye might have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I do not receive glory from men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>but I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not; if another come in his own name, him ye will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can ye believe, who receive glory one of another, and seek not the glory which [comes] from God alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is [one] who accuses you, Moses, on whom ye trust;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>for if ye had believed Moses, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if ye do not believe his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee, [or] of Tiberias,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>and a great crowd followed him, because they saw the signs which he wrought upon the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there sat with his disciples:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>but the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Jesus then, lifting up his eyes and seeing that a great crowd is coming to him, says to Philip, Whence shall we buy loaves that these may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>But this he said trying him, for he knew what he was going to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered him, Loaves for two hundred denarii are not sufficient for them, that each may have some little [portion].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fishes; but this, what is it for so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>[And] Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place: the men therefore sat down, in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>And Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed [them] to those that were set down; and in like manner of the small fishes as much as they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>And when they had been filled, he says to his disciples, Gather together the fragments which are over and above, that nothing may be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>They gathered [them] therefore together, and filled twelve hand-baskets full of fragments of the five barley loaves, which were over and above to those that had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>The men therefore, having seen the sign which Jesus had done, said, This is truly the prophet which is coming into the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>Having rowed then about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they see Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the ship; and they were frightened.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>when therefore the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, *they* got into the ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, Ye seek me not because ye have seen signs, but because ye have eaten of the loaves and been filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Work not [for] the food which perishes, but [for] the food which abides unto life eternal, which the Son of man shall give to you; for him has the Father sealed, [even] God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I am come down from heaven, not that I should do *my* will, but the will of him that has sent me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus says to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>If he called *them* gods to whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.36'>do ye say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.37'>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.39'>They sought therefore again to take him; and he went away from out of their hand</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>and departed again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptising at the first: and he abode there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>And many came to him, and said, John did no sign; but all things which John said of this [man] were true.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now there was a certain [man] sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>It was [the] Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>But when Jesus heard [it], he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>When therefore he heard, He is sick, he remained two days then in the place where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after this he says to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples say to him, Rabbi, [even but] now the Jews sought to stone thee, and goest thou thither again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walk in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>but if any one walk in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>These things said he; and after this he says to them, Lazarus, our friend, is fallen asleep, but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>The disciples therefore said to him, Lord, if he be fallen asleep, he will get well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>But Jesus spoke of his death, but *they* thought that he spoke of the rest of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Jesus therefore then said to them plainly, Lazarus has died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And I rejoice on your account that I was not there, in order that ye may believe. But let us go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Thomas therefore, called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let *us* also go, that we may die with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>Jesus therefore [on] arriving found him to have been four days already in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia off,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, that they might console them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Martha then, when she heard Jesus is coming, went to meet him; but Mary sat in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Martha therefore said to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>but even now I know, that whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus says to her, Thy brother shall rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha says to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believes on me, though he have died, shall live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>and every one who lives and believes on me shall never die. Believest thou this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She says to him, Yea, Lord; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And having said this, she went away and called her sister Mary secretly, saying, The teacher is come and calls thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>She, when she heard [that], rises up quickly and comes to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha came to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews therefore who were with her in the house and consoling her, seeing Mary that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, She goes to the tomb, that she may weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him, fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>Jesus therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, was deeply moved in spirit, and was troubled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>and said, Where have ye put him? They say to him, Lord, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>And some of them said, Could not this [man], who has opened the eyes of the blind [man], have caused that this [man] also should not have died?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus therefore, again deeply moved in himself, comes to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus says, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead, says to him, Lord, he stinks already, for he is four days [there].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus says to her, Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifted up his eyes on high and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>but I knew that thou always hearest me; but on account of the crowd who stand around I have said [it], that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And having said this, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>And the dead came forth, bound feet and hands with graveclothes, and his face was bound round with a handkerchief. Jesus says to them, Loose him and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many therefore of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what he had done, believed on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>The chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let him thus alone, all will believe on him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>nor consider that it is profitable for you that one man die for the people, and not that the whole nation perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>But this he did not say of himself; but, being high priest that year, prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for the nation only, but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>From that day therefore they took counsel that they might kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews, but went away thence into the country near the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there he sojourned with the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>But the passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they might purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>They sought therefore Jesus, and said among themselves, standing in the temple, What do ye think? that he will not come to the feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment that if any one knew where he was, he should make it known, that they might take him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Jesus therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where was the dead [man] Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from among [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>There therefore they made him a supper, and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those at table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Mary therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>One of his disciples therefore, Judas [son] of Simon, Iscariote, who was about to deliver him up, says,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>But he said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and had the bag, and carried what was put into [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to have kept this for the day of my preparation for burial;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>for ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>A great crowd therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not because of Jesus only, but also that they might see Lazarus whom he raised from among [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the chief priests took counsel that they might kill Lazarus also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because many of the Jews went away on his account and believed on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the morrow a great crowd who came to the feast, having heard that Jesus is coming into Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took branches of palms and went out to meet him, and cried, Hosanna, blessed [is] he that comes in the name of [the] Lord, the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat upon it; as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>[Now] his disciples knew not these things at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>The crowd therefore that was with him bore witness because he had called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from among [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>Therefore also the crowd met him because they had heard that he had done this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees therefore said to one another, Ye see that ye profit nothing: behold, the world is gone after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>And there were certain Greeks among those who came up that they might worship in the feast;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and they asked him saying, Sir, we desire to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip comes and tells Andrew, [and again] Andrew comes and Philip, and they tell Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>But Jesus answered them saying, The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone; but if it die, it bears much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He that loves his life shall lose it, and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If any one serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be *my* servant. [And] if any one serve me, him shall the Father honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But on account of this have I come to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, I both have glorified and will glorify [it] again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The crowd therefore, which stood [there] and heard [it], said that it had thundered. Others said, An angel has spoken to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered and said, Not on my account has this voice come, but on yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is [the] judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>and I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>But this he said signifying by what death he was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The crowd answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abides for ever; and how sayest thou that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who *is* this, the Son of man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while is the light amongst you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness may not overtake you. And he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light. Jesus said these things, and going away hid himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But though he had done so many signs before them, they believed not on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>that the word of the prophet Esaias which he said might be fulfilled, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>On this account they could not believe, because Esaias said again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that they may not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart and be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Although indeed from among the rulers also many believed on him, but on account of the Pharisees did not confess [him], that they might not be put out of the synagogue:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they loved glory from men rather than glory from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>But Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>and he that beholds me, beholds him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I am come into the world [as] light, that every one that believes on me may not abide in darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>and if any one hear my words and do not keep [them], I judge him not, for I am not come that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He that rejects me and does not receive my words, has him who judges him: the word which I have spoken, that shall judge him in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not spoken from myself, but the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what I should say and what I should speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>and I know that his commandment is life eternal. What therefore I speak, as the Father has said to me, so I speak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate therefore said to him, Thou art then a king? Jesus answered, Thou sayest [it], that I am a king. I have been born for this, and for this I have come into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate says to him, What is truth? And having said this he went out again to the Jews, and says to them, I find no fault whatever in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But ye have a custom that I release [some] one to you at the passover; will ye therefore that I release unto you the king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>They cried therefore again all, saying, Not this [man], but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns put it on his head, and put a purple robe on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>and came to him and said, Hail, king of the Jews! and gave him blows on the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>And Pilate went out again and says to them, Lo, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find in him no fault whatever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>(Jesus therefore went forth without, wearing the crown of thorn, and the purple robe.) And he says to them, Behold the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him they cried out saying, Crucify, crucify [him]. Pilate says to them, Take him ye and crucify [him], for I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to [our] law he ought to die, because he made himself Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilate therefore heard this word, he was the rather afraid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and went into the praetorium again and says to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Pilate therefore says to him, Speakest thou not to *me*? Dost thou not know that I have authority to release thee and have authority to crucify thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered, Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above. On this account he that has delivered me up to thee has [the] greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>From this time Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews cried out saying, If thou releasest this [man], thou art not a friend to Caesar. Every one making himself a king speaks against Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>Pilate therefore, having heard these words, led Jesus out and sat down upon [the] judgment-seat, at a place called Pavement, but in Hebrew Gabbatha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>(now it was [the] preparation of the passover; it was about the sixth hour;) and he says to the Jews, Behold your king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, Take [him] away, take [him] away, crucify him. Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then therefore he delivered him up to them, that he might be crucified; and they took Jesus and led him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And he went out, bearing his cross, to the place called [place] of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified him, and with him two others, [one] on this side, and [one] on that, and Jesus in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the cross. But there was written: Jesus the Nazaraean, the King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>This title therefore many of the Jews read, for the place of the city where Jesus was crucified was near; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, The king of the Jews, but that *he* said, I am king of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothes, and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and the body-coat; but the body-coat was seamless, woven through the whole from the top.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>They said therefore to one another, Let us not rend it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled which says, They parted my garments among themselves, and on my vesture they cast lots. The soldiers therefore did these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and the sister of his mother, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>Jesus therefore, seeing his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then he says unto the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now finished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, says, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>There was a vessel therefore there full of vinegar, and having filled a sponge with vinegar, and putting hyssop round it, they put it up to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>When therefore Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished; and having bowed his head, he delivered up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>The Jews therefore, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for it was [the] preparation, (for the day of that sabbath was a great [day],) demanded of Pilate that their legs might be broken and they taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first and of the other that had been crucified with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>but coming to Jesus, when they saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he who saw it bears witness, and his witness is true, and he knows that he says true that ye also may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shall be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly through fear of the Jews, demanded of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus: and Pilate allowed it. He came therefore and took away the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And Nicodemus also, who at first came to Jesus by night, came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds [weight].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>They took therefore the body of Jesus and bound it up in linen with the spices, as it is the custom with the Jews to prepare for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>But there was in the place where he had been crucified a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>There therefore, on account of the preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>And on the first [day] of the week Mary of Magdala comes in early morn to the tomb, while it was still dark, and sees the stone taken away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>She runs therefore and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, to whom Jesus was attached, and says to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and came to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>And the two ran together, and the other disciple ran forward faster than Peter, and came first to the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>and stooping down he sees the linen cloths lying; he did not however go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Simon Peter therefore comes, following him, and entered into the tomb, and sees the linen cloths lying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the handkerchief which was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a distinct place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then entered in therefore the other disciple also who came first to the tomb, and he saw and believed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>for they had not yet known the scripture, that he must rise from among [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>The disciples therefore went away again to their own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood at the tomb weeping without. As therefore she wept, she stooped down into the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>and beholds two angels sitting in white [garments], one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they say to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? She says to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>Having said these things she turned backward and beholds Jesus standing [there], and knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus says to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? Whom seekest thou? She, supposing that it was the gardener, says to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus says to her, Mary. She, turning round, says to him in Hebrew, Rabboni, which means Teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus says to her, Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and [to] my God and your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary of Magdala comes bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and [that] he had said these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>When therefore it was evening on that day, which was the first [day] of the week, and the doors shut where the disciples were, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says to them, Peace [be] to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And having said this, he shewed to them his hands and his side. The disciples rejoiced therefore, having seen the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>[Jesus] said therefore again to them, Peace [be] to you: as the Father sent me forth, I also send you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And having said this, he breathed into [them], and says to them, Receive [the] Holy Spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever [sins] ye retain, they are retained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And eight days after, his disciples were again within, and Thomas with them. Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace [be] to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then he says to Thomas, Bring thy finger here and see my hands; and bring thy hand and put it into my side; and be not unbelieving, but believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus says to him, Because thou hast seen me thou hast believed: blessed they who have not seen and have believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>Many other signs therefore also Jesus did before his disciples, which are not written in this book;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>but these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. And he manifested [himself] thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael who was of Cana of Galilee, and the [sons] of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter says to them, I go to fish. They say to him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and went on board, and that night took nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>And early morn already breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; the disciples however did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Jesus therefore says to them, Children, have ye anything to eat? They answered him, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>And he said to them, Cast the net at the right side of the ship and ye will find. They cast therefore, and they could no longer draw it, from the multitude of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved says to Peter, It is the Lord. Simon Peter therefore, having heard that it was the Lord, girded his overcoat [on him] (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>and the other disciples came in the small boat, for they were not far from the land, but somewhere about two hundred cubits, dragging the net of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>When therefore they went out on the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus says to them, Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went up and drew the net to the land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there were so many, the net was not rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus says to them, Come [and] dine. But none of the disciples dared inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives it to them, and the fish in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This is already the third time that Jesus had been manifested to the disciples, being risen from among [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>When therefore they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He says to him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. He says to him, Feed my lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He says to him again a second time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? He says to him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. He says to him, Shepherd my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He says to him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, art thou attached to me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Art thou attached to me? and said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. Jesus says to him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Verily, verily, I say to thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst where thou desiredst; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>But he said this signifying by what death he should glorify God. And having said this, he says to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter, turning round, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned at supper on his breast, and said, Lord, who is it that delivers thee up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Peter, seeing him, says to Jesus, Lord, and what [of] this [man]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus says to him, If I will that he abide until I come, what [is that] to thee? Follow thou me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>This word therefore went out among the brethren, That disciple does not die. And Jesus did not say to him, He does not die; but, If I will that he abide until I come, what [is that] to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his witness is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written.</verse>
