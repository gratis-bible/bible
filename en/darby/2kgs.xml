      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.1'>And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.2'>And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber which was in Samaria, and was sick; and he sent messengers and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.3'>And the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.4'>Now therefore thus saith Jehovah: Thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt certainly die. And Elijah departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.5'>And the messengers returned to him; and he said to them, Why have ye returned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.6'>And they said unto him, A man came up to meet us, and said to us, Go, return to the king that sent you and say to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt certainly die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.7'>And he said to them, What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and told you these words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.8'>And they said to him, He was a man in a hairy [garment], and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.9'>And he sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him, and behold, he sat on the top of the mount. And he spoke to him: Man of God, the king says, Come down!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.10'>And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, And if I be a man of God, let fire come down from the heavens and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from the heavens, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.11'>And again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he spoke and said to him, Man of God, thus says the king: Come down quickly!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.12'>And Elijah answered and said to them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from the heavens and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from the heavens, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.13'>And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him and said to him, Man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.14'>Behold, there came down fire from the heavens, and consumed the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties; but now, let my life be precious in thy sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.15'>And the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.16'>And he said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt certainly die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.17'>And he died according to the word of Jehovah that Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead, in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; for he had no son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.18'>And the rest of the acts of Ahaziah, what he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.1'>And it came to pass when Jehovah would take up Elijah into the heavens by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.2'>And Elijah said to Elisha, Abide here, I pray thee; for Jehovah has sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! So they went down to Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.3'>And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Dost thou know that Jehovah will take away thy master from over thy head to-day? And he said, I also know it: be silent!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.4'>And Elijah said to him, Elisha, abide here, I pray thee; for Jehovah has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! And they came to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.5'>And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho drew near to Elisha and said to him, Dost thou know that Jehovah will take away thy master from over thy head to-day? And he said, I also know it: be silent!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.6'>And Elijah said to him, Abide here, I pray thee; for Jehovah has sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! And they two went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.7'>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite afar off; and they two stood by the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.8'>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither; and they two went over on dry ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.9'>And it came to pass when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.10'>And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be [so].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.11'>And it came to pass as they went on, and talked, that behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire; and they parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.12'>And Elisha saw [it], and he cried, My father, my father! the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof! And he saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own garments and rent them in two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.13'>And he took up the mantle of Elijah which fell from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.14'>and he took the mantle of Elijah which had fallen from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? He also smote the waters, and they parted hither and thither, and Elisha went over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.15'>And the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho on the opposite side saw him, and they said, The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.16'>and said to him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty valiant men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master, lest perhaps the Spirit of Jehovah have taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some ravine. And he said, Ye shall not send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.17'>And they pressed him till he was ashamed, and he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men, and they sought three days, but did not find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.18'>And they came again to him (now he was staying at Jericho); and he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.19'>And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold now, the situation of the city is good, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.20'>And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt in it. And they brought it to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.21'>And he went forth to the source of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith Jehovah: I have healed these waters: there shall not be from thence any more death or barrenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.22'>And the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.23'>And he went up from thence to Bethel, and as he went up by the way, there came forth little boys out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, bald head; go up, bald head!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.24'>And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tore forty-two children of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.25'>And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.1'>And Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; and he reigned twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.2'>And he wrought evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not like his father, and like his mother; and he took away the column of Baal that his father had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.3'>Only, he clave to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel to sin: he did not depart therefrom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.4'>And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams, with the wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.5'>And it came to pass when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.6'>And at that time king Jehoram went out of Samaria and inspected all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.7'>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.8'>And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he said, By way of the wilderness of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.9'>And the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom, and they made a circuit of seven days' journey. And there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.10'>And the king of Israel said, Alas! that Jehovah has called these three kings together, to give them into the hand of Moab!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.11'>And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.12'>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Jehovah is with him. And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.13'>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, Not so, for Jehovah has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.14'>And Elisha said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee nor see thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.15'>And now fetch me a minstrel. And it came to pass when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.16'>And he said, Thus saith Jehovah: Make this valley full of ditches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.17'>For thus saith Jehovah: Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet this valley shall be filled with water, and ye shall drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.18'>And this is a light thing in the sight of Jehovah: he will give the Moabites also into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.19'>And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.20'>And it came to pass in the morning, when the oblation was offered up, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.21'>And all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, and they were called together, all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood by the border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.22'>And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun rose upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side red as blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.23'>And they said, This is blood: the kings are entirely destroyed, and have smitten one another; and now, Moab, to the spoil!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.24'>And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, and they fled before them; and they entered in and smote Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.25'>And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone and filled it, and they stopped every well of water, and felled every good tree, until they left [only] the stones at Kirhareseth; and the slingers went about it, and smote it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.26'>And the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, and he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.27'>And he took his eldest son, that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him up for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to [their own] land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.1'>And a woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried to Elisha saying, Thy servant my husband is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant feared Jehovah; and the creditor is come to take my two children to be bondmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.2'>And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for thee? Tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid has not anything at all in the house but a pot of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.3'>And he said, Go, borrow for thyself vessels abroad from all thy neighbours, empty vessels; let it not be few;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.4'>and go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels, and set aside what is full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.5'>And she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons: they brought [the vessels] to her, and she poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.6'>And it came to pass when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.7'>And she came and told the man of God; and he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou [and] thy sons on the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.8'>And it came to pass on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a wealthy woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, [that] as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.9'>And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who passes by us continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.10'>Let us make, I pray thee, a small upper chamber with walls, and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a lampstand; and it shall be when he cometh to us, he shall turn in thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.11'>And it came to pass on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the upper chamber, and lay there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.12'>And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And he called her, and she stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.13'>And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she said, I dwell among mine own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.14'>And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi said, Verily, she has no son, and her husband is old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.15'>And he said, Call her; and he called her; and she stood in the doorway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.16'>And he said, At this appointed time, when thy term is come, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.17'>And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that appointed time in the next year as Elisha had said to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.18'>And the child grew, and it came to pass one day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.19'>And he said to his father, My head, my head! And he said to the servant, Carry him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.20'>And he carried him, and brought him to his mother; and he sat on her knees till noon, and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.21'>And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut [the door] upon him, and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.22'>And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, and I will run to the man of God, and come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.23'>And he said, Why wilt thou go to him to-day? It is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, [It is] well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.24'>Then she saddled the ass, and said to her servant, Drive and go forward; slack not the riding for me, except I bid thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.25'>And she went and came to the man of God, to mount Carmel. And it came to pass when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, there is the Shunammite:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.26'>run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she said, It is well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.27'>And she came to the man of God to the mountain, and caught him by the feet; and Gehazi drew near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone, for her soul is troubled within her, and Jehovah has hidden it from me, and has not told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.28'>And she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.29'>And he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way. If thou meet any man, salute him not, and if any salute thee, answer him not again; and lay my staff upon the face of the lad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.30'>And the mother of the lad said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! And he rose up and followed her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.31'>And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the lad; but there was neither voice, nor sign of attention. And he returned to meet him, and told him saying, The lad is not awaked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.32'>And when Elisha came into the house, behold, the child was dead, [and] laid upon his bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.33'>And he went in and shut the door upon them both, and prayed to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.34'>And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands, and bent over him; and the flesh of the child grew warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.35'>And he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and bent over him. And the lad sneezed seven times, and the lad opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.36'>And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. And he called her; and she came to him. And he said, Take up thy son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.37'>And she came and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.12'>And they said, It is false! tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spoke he to me saying, Thus saith Jehovah: I have anointed thee king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.13'>Then they hasted and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the very stairs, and blew with trumpets, and said, Jehu is king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.14'>And Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram kept Ramoth-Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.15'>and king Joram had returned to be healed in Jizreel of the wounds that the Syrians had given him, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your will, let not a fugitive escape out of the city to go to tell [it] in Jizreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.16'>And Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jizreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.17'>And the watchman stood on the tower in Jizreel, and saw Jehu's company as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.18'>So there went one on horseback to meet him; and he said, Thus saith the king: Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told saying, The messenger came to them, and he does not return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.19'>And he sent out a second on horseback; and he came to them and said, Thus saith the king: Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.20'>And the watchman told saying, He came to them, and does not return. And the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.21'>Then Joram said, Make ready! And they made ready his chariot. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot; and they went out to meet Jehu, and met him in the plot of Naboth the Jizreelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.22'>And it came to pass when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he said, What peace, so long as the fornications of thy mother Jezebel and her sorceries are so many?</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.25'>And he said to Bidkar his captain, Take him up [and] cast him in the plot of the field of Naboth the Jizreelite. For remember how, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, that Jehovah laid this burden upon him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.26'>Certainly I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith Jehovah; and I will requite thee in this plot, saith Jehovah. And now, take [and] cast him into the plot, according to the word of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.27'>When Ahaziah king of Judah saw [that], he fled by the way of the garden-house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in his chariot. It was on the ascent of Gur, which is by Jibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.28'>And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.33'>And he said, Throw her down! And they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses; and he trampled on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.34'>And he came in, and ate and drank; and he said, Go, look, I pray you, after this cursed [woman], and bury her; for she is a king's daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.35'>And they went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of the hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.36'>And they came back and told him. And he said, This is the word of Jehovah, which he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite saying, In the plot of Jizreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.37'>and the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the open field in the plot of Jizreel, so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.6'>And he wrote a letter the second time to them saying, If ye are mine, and will hearken to my voice, take the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jizreel to-morrow at this time.

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.24'>And they entered in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings. Now Jehu appointed eighty men without, and said, He that allows any of the men to escape that I have brought into your hands, his life shall be for the life of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.25'>And it came to pass as soon as they had ended offering up the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the couriers and to the captains, Go in, slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the couriers and the captains cast [them] there. And they went to the city of the house of Baal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.26'>and brought forth the columns out of the house of Baal, and burned them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.27'>and they broke down the column of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.28'>Thus Jehu extirpated Baal out of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.1'>Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hephzibah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.2'>And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, like the abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.3'>And he built again the high places that Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars to Baal and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.4'>And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, of which Jehovah had said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.5'>And he built altars to all the host of heaven in both courts of the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.6'>And he caused his son to pass through the fire, and used magic and divination, and appointed necromancers and soothsayers: he wrought evil beyond measure in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.7'>And he set the graven image of the Asherah that he had made, in the house of which Jehovah had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.8'>neither will I any more cause the foot of Israel to wander away from the land that I gave their fathers; if they will only take heed to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.9'>But they would not hearken, and Manasseh led them astray to do more evil than the nations that Jehovah had destroyed from before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.10'>And Jehovah spoke by his servants the prophets saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.11'>Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.12'>therefore thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.13'>And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipeth a pan, wiping it and turning it upside down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.14'>And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.15'>because they have done evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt even to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.16'>And Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had filled Jerusalem [with it] from one end to another; beside his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing evil in the sight of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.17'>And the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin which he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.18'>And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza; and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.20'>And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had done;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.21'>and he walked in all the way that his father had walked in, and served the idols that his father had served, and worshipped them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.22'>and he forsook Jehovah the God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.23'>And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.24'>But the people of the land smote all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.26'>And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza; and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.2'>And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand nor to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.3'>And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, [that] the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Jehovah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.4'>Go up to Hilkijah the high priest, that he may sum up the money which is brought into the house of Jehovah, which the doorkeepers have gathered of the people,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.6'>to the carpenters and the builders and the masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.7'>But no reckoning was made with them of the money that was given into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.8'>And Hilkijah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkijah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.9'>And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again and said, Thy servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.10'>And Shaphan the scribe informed the king saying, Hilkijah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.11'>And it came to pass when the king heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.12'>And the king commanded Hilkijah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.13'>Go, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book which is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book, to do according to all that is written [there] for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.14'>And Hilkijah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe: now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter [of the town]; and they spoke with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.15'>And she said to them, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Tell the man that sent you to me,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.17'>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my fury is kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.18'>But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him: Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel touching the words which thou hast heard:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.19'>Because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before Jehovah, when thou heardest what I spoke against this place and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and didst rend thy garments and weep before me, I also have heard [thee], saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.20'>Therefore, behold, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.12'>And the king broke down the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Jehovah, and he shattered them, [removing them] from thence, and cast the powder of them into the torrent of Kidron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.13'>And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.</verse>
