And Aaron was silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they went near, and carried them in their vests out of the camp, as Moses had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar his sons, Your heads shall ye not uncover, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come on all the assembly; but your brethren, the whole house of Israel, shall bewail the burning which Jehovah hath kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And ye shall not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you.
