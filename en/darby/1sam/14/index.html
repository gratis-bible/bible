But he did not tell his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Saul abode at the extreme end of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which [was] in Migron; and the people that were with him were about six hundred men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>(And Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, Jehovah's priest in Shiloh, wore the ephod.) And the people did not know that Jonathan was gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side; and the name of the one [was] Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The one crag [formed] a pillar on the north opposite to Michmash, and the other on the south opposite to Geba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: perhaps Jehovah will work for us; for there is no restraint to Jehovah to save by many or by few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And his armour-bearer said to him, Do all that is in thy heart; turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will shew ourselves to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If they say thus to us, Stand still until we come to you, then we will stay in our place, and will not go up to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if they say thus, Come up to us, then we will go up; for Jehovah has given them into our hand; and this shall be the sign to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And both of them shewed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armour-bearer and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you something. And Jonathan said to his armour-bearer, Come up after me; for Jehovah has delivered them into the hand of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armour-bearer after him; and they fell before Jonathan; and his armour-bearer slew after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And that first slaughter which Jonathan and his armour-bearer wrought was about twenty men, as it were on the half-furrow of an acre of land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And there was trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the ravagers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked; for it was a trembling [from] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on slaying one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said Saul to the people that were with him, Muster now, and see who is gone from us. And they mustered, and behold, Jonathan and his armour-bearer were not there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Saul said to Ahijah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass while Saul talked to the priest, that the noise which was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased; and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul and all the people that were with him were called together, and they came to the battle; and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, a very great confusion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And there were Hebrews with the Philistines before that time, who had gone up with them into the camp round about; and they also [turned] to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in mount Ephraim heard that the Philistines fled, and they also followed hard after them in the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehovah saved Israel that day; and the battle passed over beyond Beth-Aven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the men of Israel were distressed that day. Now Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth food until evening, and [until] I am avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the people had come into the wood, and behold, the honey flowed; but no man put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people; and he put forth the end of his staff which was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes became bright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then answered one of the people and said, Thy father strictly adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth food this day; and the people are faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jonathan said, My father has troubled the land: see, I pray you, that mine eyes are bright, because I tasted a little of this honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How much more, if the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for would there not now have been a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Ajalon; and the people were very faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the people fell on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; and the people ate [them] with the blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Jehovah, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have acted perversely: roll me now a great stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring near to me every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slaughter them here, and eat; and sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slaughtered [them] there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Saul built an altar to Jehovah: this was the first altar he built to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and plunder them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever is good in thy sight. Then said the priest, Let us come near hither to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Saul inquired of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou give them into the hand of Israel? But he did not answer him that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the heads of the people; and know and see wherein this sin has been this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For, [as] Jehovah liveth, who has saved Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall certainly die. And no one answered him among all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then said he to all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what is good in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Saul said to Jehovah the God of Israel, Give a perfect [testimony]! And Jonathan and Saul were taken, and the people escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Saul said, Cast [lots] between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him and said, With the end of the staff which is in my hand I tasted a little honey, [and] behold, I must die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Saul said, God do so [to me] and more also; thou shalt certainly die, Jonathan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far be it! [as] Jehovah liveth, there shall not a hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has wrought with God this day. So the people delivered Jonathan, that he died not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies round about, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; and whithersoever he turned himself, he discomfited [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of their spoilers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Jishvi, and Malchi-shua. And the names of his two daughters: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz; and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Kish the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner were sons of Abiel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him to himself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
