And all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Nahash the Ammonite said to them, On this [condition] will I treat with you, that I thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the elders of Jabesh said to him, Allow us seven days, and we will send messengers into all the districts of Israel; and if there be no man to deliver us, we will come out to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and told these words in the ears of the people. And all the people lifted up their voice and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And behold, Saul came after the oxen from the field; and Saul said, What [aileth] the people that they weep?

And the fear of Jehovah fell on the people, and they came out as one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he numbered them in Bezek, and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said to the messengers that had come, Thus shall ye say to the men of Jabesh-Gilead: To-morrow ye shall have deliverance when the sun is hot.
