      <chapter osisID='Neh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.1'>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the fortress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and [certain] men of Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'>And they said to me, Those who remain, that are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction and reproach; and the wall of Jerusalem is in ruins, and its gates are burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat and wept, and mourned for days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'>and said, I beseech thee, Jehovah, God of the heavens, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, confessing the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'>We have acted very perversely against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances that thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'>Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the peoples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'>but if ye return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'>And they are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.11'>O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was the king's cupbearer.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'>And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that] wine was before him, and I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now, I had never been sad in his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'>And the king said to me, Why is thy face sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sadness of heart. And I was very sore afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'>And I said to the king, Let the king live for ever! Why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lies waste, and its gates are consumed with fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.4'>And the king said to me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.5'>And I said to the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.6'>And the king said to me the queen also sitting by him, For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? And it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.7'>And I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may set me forward till I come into Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.8'>and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which [appertains] to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.9'>And I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of a force and horsemen with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.10'>And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobijah the servant, the Ammonite, heard [of it], it grieved them exceedingly that there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.11'>And I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.12'>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me but I told no man what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem and there was no beast with me, except the beast that I rode upon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.13'>And I went out by night by the valley-gate, even toward the jackal-fountain, and to the dung-gate; and I viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were in ruins, and its gates were consumed with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.14'>And I went on to the fountain-gate, and to the king's pool; and there was no place for the beast under me to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.15'>And I went up in the night through the valley, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the valley-gate and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.16'>And the rulers did not know whither I went or what I did, for I had not as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.17'>And I said to them, Ye see the distress that we are in, that Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.18'>And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me; as also of the king's words which he had said unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. And they strengthened their hands for the good [work].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.19'>And Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobijah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it; and they mocked us and despised us, and said, What is this thing which ye do? will ye rebel against the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.20'>And I answered them, and said to them, The God of the heavens, he will prosper us, and we his servants will arise and build; but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.1'>And Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they built the sheep-gate. They hallowed it, and set up its doors; and they hallowed it even to the tower of Meah, to the tower of Hananeel.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'>And it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that we built the wall, he was angry and very indignant, and mocked the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'>And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? shall they be permitted to go on? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, when they are burned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'>And Tobijah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox went up, it would break down their stone wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'>Hear, our God, for we are despised, and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in a land of captivity!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'>And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee; for they have provoked the builders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'>But we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to the half thereof; for the people had a mind to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'>And it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobijah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being repaired, that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.8'>and conspired all of them together to come to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.9'>Then we prayed to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.10'>And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens faileth, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build at the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.11'>And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them and kill them, and put an end to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.12'>And it came to pass that when the Jews that dwelt by them came and told us so ten times, from all the places whence they returned to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'>I set in the lower places behind the wall in exposed places, I even set the people, according to their families, with their swords, their spears and their bows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'>And I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not afraid of them: remember the Lord who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'>And it came to pass that when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had defeated their counsel, we returned all of us to the wall, every one to his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'>And from that time forth the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held the spears, and the shields, and the bows, and the corslets; and the captains were behind all the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'>They that built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, with those that loaded, wrought in the work with one hand, and with the other they held a weapon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'>And the builders had every one his sword girded by his side, and built. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'>And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and extended, and we are scattered upon the wall, one far from another:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'>in what place ye hear the sound of the trumpet, thither shall ye assemble to us; our God will fight for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'>And we laboured in the work; and half of them held the spears from the rising of the dawn till the stars appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'>Likewise at the same time I said to the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and [be for] labour in the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'>And neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our garments: every one had his weapon on his right side.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'>And there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many, and we must procure corn that we may eat and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>And there were that said, We have had to pledge our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses, that we might procure corn in the dearth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'>And there were that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute upon our fields and vineyards;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'>yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and behold, we must bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage [already]; neither is it in the power of our hand [to redeem them], for other men have our fields and our vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'>And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'>And I consulted with myself; and I remonstrated with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother! And I set a great assembly against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'>And I said to them, We, according to our ability, have redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold to the nations; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? And they were silent and found no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'>And I said, The thing that ye do is not good. Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, so as not to be the reproach of the nations our enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'>I also, my brethren and my servants, we might exact usury of them, money and corn. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'>Restore, I pray you, to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive-gardens, and their houses, also the hundredth [part] of the money, and of the corn, the wine and the oil, that ye have exacted of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>And they said, We will restore [them], and will require nothing of them; so will we do, as thou hast said. And I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house and from his earnings, that performeth not this promise: even thus be he shaken out and emptied! And all the congregation said, Amen! And they praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'>But the former governors that were before me had been chargeable to the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver: even their servants bore rule over the people. But I did not so, because of the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'>Yea, also I applied myself to this work of the wall, and we bought no fields; and all my servants were gathered thither for the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'>And there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and the rulers, besides those that came to us from among the nations that were about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.18'>And that which was prepared daily was one ox [and] six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days all sorts of wine in abundance. Yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor; for the service was heavy upon this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.19'>Remember for me, my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.1'>And it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobijah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it (though at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'>that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'>And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down. Why should the work cease, whilst I leave it and come down to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'>And they sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them in the same manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.5'>Then sent Sanballat his servant to me in this manner the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.6'>in which was written: It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says [it, that] thou and the Jews think to rebel, for which cause thou buildest the wall, and according to these words thou wilt become their king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.7'>And thou hast also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning thee at Jerusalem saying, There is a king in Judah! And now it will be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.8'>And I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.9'>For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be slackened from the work, that it be not carried out. Now therefore strengthen my hands!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.10'>And I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabeel, who had shut himself up. And he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they are coming to kill thee; even in the night are they coming to kill thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.11'>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, could go into the temple, and live? I will not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.12'>And I perceived, and behold, God had not sent him; for he pronounced this prophecy against me; and Tobijah and Sanballat had hired him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.13'>Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have wherewith to spread an evil report, that they might reproach me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.14'>My God, remember Tobijah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets who would have put me in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.15'>So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.16'>And it came to pass that when all our enemies heard [of it], all the nations that were about us were afraid and were much cast down in their own eyes, and they perceived that this work was wrought by our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.17'>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobijah, and those of Tobijah came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.18'>For there were many in Judah sworn to him; for he was a son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.19'>Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. [And] Tobijah sent letters to put me in fear.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.7.1'>And it came to pass when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, that the doorkeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.14'>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds which I have done for the house of my God, and for the charges thereof!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.15'>In those days I saw in Judah some treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading them on asses; as also wine, grapes and figs, and all manner of burdens; and they brought them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I protested in the day on which they sold the victuals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.16'>Men of Tyre also dwelt therein, who brought fish and all manner of ware, and sold it on the sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.17'>And I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this which ye do, profaning the sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.18'>Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us and upon this city? And ye will bring more wrath against Israel by profaning the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.19'>And it came to pass, that when it began to be dark in the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut; and I commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath. And I set [some] of my servants at the gates, so that no burden should be brought in on the sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.20'>And the dealers and sellers of all kind of ware passed the night without Jerusalem once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.21'>And I testified against them, and said to them, Why do ye pass the night before the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came not on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.22'>And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to hallow the sabbath day. Remember this also for me, my God, and spare me according to thy great loving-kindness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.23'>In those days also I saw Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.24'>And their children spoke half in the language of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.25'>And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair, and adjured them by God [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.26'>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among the many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel; but even him did foreign wives cause to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.27'>And should we hearken to you to do all this great evil, to act unfaithfully to our God by marrying foreign wives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.28'>And [one] of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; and I chased him from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.29'>Remember them, my God, for they are polluters of the priesthood, and of the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.30'>And I purified them from all foreigners, and appointed the charges of the priests and the Levites, every one in his service;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.31'>and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good!</verse>
