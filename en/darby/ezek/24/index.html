Bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>for her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the bare rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That it might cause fury to come up to execute vengeance, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Heap on the wood, kindle the fire, boil thoroughly the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then set it empty upon its coals, that it may be hot, and the brass of it may burn, and that its filthiness may be molten in it, [and] that its rust may be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She hath exhausted [her] labours, yet her great rust goeth not forth out of her: let her rust be in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In thy filthiness is lewdness, for I have purged thee, and thou art not pure. Thou shalt no more be purged from thy filthiness, till I have satisfied my fury upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I Jehovah have spoken [it]: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, nor will I repent. According to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke; yet thou shalt not mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the dead; bind thy turban upon thee, and put thy sandals upon thy feet, and cover not the beard, and eat not the bread of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I spoke unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died. And I did in the morning as I was commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, which thou doest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I said to them, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and your soul's longing; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover the beard, neither eat the bread of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and your turbans shall be upon your heads, and your sandals upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall waste away in your iniquities and moan one toward another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus Ezekiel shall be unto you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do: when it cometh, then ye shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereunto they lift up their soul, their sons and their daughters,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee, to cause [thine] ears to hear [it]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him that is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb. So shalt thou be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
