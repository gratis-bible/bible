there shall not be male or female barren with thee, or with thy cattle;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and Jehovah will take away from thee all sickness, and none of the evil infirmities of Egypt, which thou knowest, will he put upon thee; but he will lay them upon all them that hate thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And thou shalt consume all the peoples that Jehovah thy God will give up unto thee; thine eye shall not spare them, and thou shalt not serve their gods; for that would be a snare unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If thou shouldest say in thy heart, These nations are greater than I; how can I dispossess them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>fear them not; remember well what Jehovah thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all the Egyptians;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the powerful hand, and the stretched-out arm, whereby Jehovah thy God brought thee out: so will Jehovah thy God do unto all the peoples whom thou fearest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moreover, Jehovah thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and they that hide themselves from thee, are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou shalt not be afraid of them; for Jehovah thy God is in thy midst, a God great and terrible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehovah thy God will cast out those nations from before thee by little and little; thou shalt not be able to make an end of them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Jehovah thy God will give them up before thee, and will confound them with great consternation, until they are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he will give their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt put out their name from under the heavens; no man shall stand before thee, until thou hast destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire; thou shalt not covet the silver and gold [that is] on them and take it unto thee, lest thou be ensnared therein; for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
