      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place; and he signified [it], sending by his angel, to his bondman John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed [is] he that reads, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things written in it; for the time [is] near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John to the seven assemblies which [are] in Asia: Grace to you and peace from [him] who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits which [are] before his throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him [be] the glory and the might to the ages of ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold, he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they which have pierced him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail because of him. Yea. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith [the] Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus, was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I became in [the] Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>saying, What thou seest write in a book, and send to the seven assemblies: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And I turned back to see the voice which spoke with me; and having turned, I saw seven golden lamps,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>and in the midst of the [seven] lamps [one] like [the] Son of man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>his head and hair white like white wool, as snow; and his eyes as a flame of fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>and his feet like fine brass, as burning in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>and having in his right hand seven stars; and out of his mouth a sharp two-edged sword going forth; and his countenance as the sun shines in its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead; and he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; *I* am the first and the last,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write therefore what thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>The mystery of the seven stars which thou hast seen on my right hand, and the seven golden lamps. The seven stars are angels of the seven assemblies; and the seven lamps are seven assemblies.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>To the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write: These things says he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lamps:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know thy works and [thy] labour, and thine endurance, and that thou canst not bear evil [men]; and thou hast tried them who say that themselves [are] apostles and are not, and hast found them liars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>and endurest, and hast borne for my name's sake, and hast not wearied:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>but I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works: but if not, I am coming to thee, and I will remove thy lamp out of its place, except thou shalt repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitanes, which *I* also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him that overcomes, I will give to him to eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>And to the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write: These things says the first and the last, who became dead, and lived:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I know thy tribulation and thy poverty; but thou art rich; and the railing of those who say that they themselves are Jews, and are not, but a synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Fear nothing [of] what thou art about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give to thee the crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. He that overcomes shall in no wise be injured of the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>And to the angel of the assembly in Pergamos write: These things says he that has the sharp two-edged sword:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I know where thou dwellest, where the throne of Satan [is]; and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in the days in which Antipas my faithful witness [was], who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things against thee: that thou hast there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a snare before the sons of Israel, to eat [of] idol sacrifices and commit fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>So thou also hast those who hold the doctrine of Nicolaitanes in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Repent therefore: but if not, I come to thee quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him that overcomes, to him will I give of the hidden manna; and I will give to him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he that receives [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>And to the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write: These things says the Son of God, he that has his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet [are] like fine brass:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know thy works, and love, and faith, and service, and thine endurance, and thy last works [to be] more than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have against thee that thou permittest the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself prophetess, and she teaches and leads astray my servants to commit fornication and eat of idol sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I gave her time that she should repent, and she will not repent of her fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>and her children will I kill with death; and all the assemblies shall know that *I* am he that searches [the] reins and [the] hearts; and I will give to you each according to your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But to you I say, the rest who [are] in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I do not cast upon you any other burden;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>but what ye have hold fast till I shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>And he that overcomes, and he that keeps unto the end my works, to him will I give authority over the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>and he shall shepherd them with an iron rod; as vessels of pottery are they broken in pieces, as I also have received from my Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>and I will give to him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>And to the angel of the assembly in Sardis write: These things saith he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Be watchful, and strengthen the things that remain, which are about to die, for I have not found thy works complete before my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and keep [it] and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come [upon thee] as a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I shall come upon thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>But thou hast a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, because they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He that overcomes, *he* shall be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot his name out of the book of life, and will confess his name before my Father and before his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>And to the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write: These things saith the holy, the true; he that has the key of David, he who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an opened door, which no one can shut, because thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that *I* have loved thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, *I* also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>I come quickly: hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>He that overcomes, him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more at all out; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God, and my new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>And to the angel of the assembly in Laodicea write: These things says the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; I would thou wert cold or hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>Thus because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to spue thee out of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because thou sayest, I am rich, and am grown rich, and have need of nothing, and knowest not that *thou* art the wretched and the miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified by fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white garments, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not be made manifest; and eye-salve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>I rebuke and discipline as many as I love; be zealous therefore and repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking; if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>He that overcomes, to him will I give to sit with me in my throne; as *I* also have overcome, and have sat down with my Father in his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard as of a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will shew thee the things which must take place after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>Immediately I became in [the] Spirit; and behold, a throne stood in the heaven, and upon the throne one sitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>and he [that was] sitting like in appearance to a stone [of] jasper and a sardius, and a rainbow round the throne like in appearance to an emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>And round the throne twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones twenty-four elders sitting, clothed with white garments; and on their heads golden crowns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And out of the throne go forth lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and seven lamps of fire, burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>and before the throne, as a glass sea, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, four living creatures, full of eyes, before and behind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>and the first living creature like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature having the face as of a man, and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And the four living creatures, each one of them having respectively six wings; round and within they are full of eyes; and they cease not day and night saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And when the living creatures shall give glory and honour and thanksgiving to him that sits upon the throne, who lives to the ages of ages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the twenty-four elders shall fall before him that sits upon the throne, and do homage to him that lives to the ages of ages; and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>Thou art worthy, O our Lord and [our] God, to receive glory and honour and power; for *thou* hast created all things, and for thy will they were, and they have been created.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw on the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book, written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who [is] worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no one was able in the heaven, or upon the earth, or underneath the earth, to open the book, or to regard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And *I* wept much because no one had been found worthy to open the book nor to regard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>And one of the elders says to me, Do not weep. Behold, the lion which [is] of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, has overcome [so as] to open the book, and its seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God [which are] sent into all the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>and it came and took [it] out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when it took the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, having each a harp and golden bowls full of incenses, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they sing a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open its seals; because thou hast been slain, and hast redeemed to God, by thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>and made them to our God kings and priests; and they shall reign over the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>And I saw, and I heard [the] voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and their number was ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that has been slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And every creature which is in the heaven and upon the earth and under the earth, and [those that are] upon the sea, and all things in them, heard I saying, To him that sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb, blessing, and honour, and glory, and might, to the ages of ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four living creatures said, Amen; and the elders fell down and did homage.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as a voice of thunder, Come [and see].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I saw: and behold, a white horse, and he that sat upon it having a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and that he might conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when it opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come [and see].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And another, a red horse, went forth; and to him that sat upon it, to him it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they should slay one another; and there was given to him a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when it opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come [and see]. And I saw: and behold, a black horse, and he that sat upon it having a balance in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard as a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenixes of barley for a denarius: and do not injure the oil and the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when it opened the fourth seal, I heard [the voice of] the fourth living creature saying, Come [and see].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And I saw: and behold, a pale horse, and he that sat upon it, his name [was] Death, and hades followed with him; and authority was given to him over the fourth of the earth to slay with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and by the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when it opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O sovereign Ruler, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And there was given to them, to each one a white robe; and it was said to them that they should rest yet a little while, until both their fellow-bondmen and their brethren, who were about to be killed as they, should be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I saw when it opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as hair sackcloth, and the whole moon became as blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>and the stars of heaven fell upon the earth, as a fig tree, shaken by a great wind, casts its unseasonable figs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>And the heaven was removed as a book rolled up, and every mountain and island were removed out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>And the kings of the earth, and the great, and the chiliarchs, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman and freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and have us hidden from [the] face of him that sits upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>because the great day of his wrath is come, and who is able to stand?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>And after this I saw four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding fast the four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>And I saw another angel ascending from [the] sunrising, having [the] seal of [the] living God; and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it had been given to hurt the earth and the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we shall have sealed the bondmen of our God upon their foreheads.</verse>
