And Elijah departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the messengers returned to him; and he said to them, Why have ye returned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they said unto him, A man came up to meet us, and said to us, Go, return to the king that sent you and say to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt certainly die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said to them, What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and told you these words?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they said to him, He was a man in a hairy [garment], and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him, and behold, he sat on the top of the mount. And he spoke to him: Man of God, the king says, Come down!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, And if I be a man of God, let fire come down from the heavens and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from the heavens, and consumed him and his fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he spoke and said to him, Man of God, thus says the king: Come down quickly!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Elijah answered and said to them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from the heavens and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from the heavens, and consumed him and his fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him and said to him, Man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, there came down fire from the heavens, and consumed the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties; but now, let my life be precious in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt certainly die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he died according to the word of Jehovah that Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead, in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; for he had no son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the rest of the acts of Ahaziah, what he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
