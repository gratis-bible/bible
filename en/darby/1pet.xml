      <chapter osisID='1Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.1'>Peter, apostle of Jesus Christ, to [the] sojourners of [the] dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.2'>elect according to [the] foreknowledge of God [the] Father, by sanctification of [the] Spirit, unto [the] obedience and sprinkling of [the] blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.3'>Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to his great mercy, has begotten us again to a living hope through [the] resurrection of Jesus Christ from among [the] dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.4'>to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance, reserved in [the] heavens for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.5'>who are kept guarded by [the] power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in [the] last time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>Wherein ye exult, for a little while at present, if needed, put to grief by various trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes, though it be proved by fire, be found to praise and glory and honour in [the] revelation of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>whom, having not seen, ye love; on whom [though] not now looking, but believing, ye exult with joy unspeakable and filled with [the] glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>receiving the end of your faith, [the] salvation of [your] souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>Concerning which salvation prophets, who have prophesied of the grace towards you, sought out and searched out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which [was] in them pointed out, testifying before of the sufferings which [belonged] to Christ, and the glories after these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves but to you they ministered those things, which have now been announced to you by those who have declared to you the glad tidings by [the] Holy Spirit, sent from heaven, which angels desire to look into.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>Wherefore, having girded up the loins of your mind, [be] sober [and] hope with perfect stedfastness in the grace [which will be] brought to you at [the] revelation of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>as children of obedience, not conformed to [your] former lusts in your ignorance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>but as he who has called you is holy, be ye also holy in all [your] conversation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>because it is written, Be ye holy, for *I* am holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.17'>And if ye invoke as Father him who, without regard of persons, judges according to the work of each, pass your time of sojourn in fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.18'>knowing that ye have been redeemed, not by corruptible [things, as] silver or gold, from your vain conversation handed down from [your] fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.19'>but by precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, [the blood] of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.20'>foreknown indeed before [the] foundation of [the] world, but who has been manifested at the end of times for your sakes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.21'>who by him do believe on God, who has raised him from among [the] dead and given him glory, that your faith and hope should be in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.22'>Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth to unfeigned brotherly love, love one another out of a pure heart fervently;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.23'>being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by [the] living and abiding word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.24'>Because all flesh [is] as grass, and all its glory as [the] flower of grass. The grass has withered and [its] flower has fallen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.25'>but the word of [the] Lord abides for eternity. But this is the word which in the glad tidings [is] preached to you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>Laying aside therefore all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.2'>as newborn babes desire earnestly the pure mental milk of the word, that by it ye may grow up to salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.3'>if indeed ye have tasted that the Lord [is] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.4'>To whom coming, a living stone, cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>Because it is contained in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Zion a corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.7'>To you therefore who believe [is] the preciousness; but to the disobedient, the stone which the builders cast away as worthless, this is become head of [the] corner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>and a stone of stumbling and rock of offence; [who] stumble at the word, being disobedient to which also they have been appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>But *ye* [are] a chosen race, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, that ye might set forth the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness to his wonderful light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>who once [were] not a people, but now God's people; who were not enjoying mercy, but now have found mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Beloved, I exhort [you], as strangers and sojourners, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that [as to that] in which they speak against you as evildoers, they may through [your] good works, [themselves] witnessing [them], glorify God in [the] day of visitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Be in subjection [therefore] to every human institution for the Lord's sake; whether to [the] king as supreme,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>or to rulers as sent by him, for vengeance on evildoers, and praise to them that do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>Because so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye put to silence the ignorance of senseless men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>as free, and not as having liberty as a cloak of malice, but as God's bondmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>Shew honour to all, love the brotherhood, fear God, honour the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>Servants, [be] subject with all fear to your masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the ill-tempered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>For this [is] acceptable, if one, for conscience sake towards God, endure griefs, suffering unjustly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>For what glory [is it], if sinning and being buffeted ye shall bear [it]? but if, doing good and suffering, ye shall bear [it], this is acceptable with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>For to this have ye been called; for Christ also has suffered for you, leaving you a model that ye should follow in his steps:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>who, [when] reviled, reviled not again; [when] suffering, threatened not; but gave [himself] over into the hands of him who judges righteously;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, in order that, being dead to sins, we may live to righteousness: by whose stripes ye have been healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>For ye were going astray as sheep, but have now returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>Likewise, wives, [be] subject to your own husbands, that, even if any are disobedient to the word, they may be gained without [the] word by the conversation of the wives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.2'>having witnessed your pure conversation [carried out] in fear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>whose adorning let it not be that outward one of tressing of hair, and wearing gold, or putting on apparel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.4'>but the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible [ornament] of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.5'>For thus also the holy women who have hoped in God heretofore adorned themselves, being subject to their own husbands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose children ye have become, doing good, and not fearing with any kind of consternation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>[Ye] husbands likewise, dwell with [them] according to knowledge, as with a weaker, [even] the female, vessel, giving [them] honour, as also fellow-heirs of [the] grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>Finally, [be] all of one mind, sympathising, full of brotherly love, tender hearted, humble minded;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing; but on the contrary, blessing [others], because ye have been called to this, that ye should inherit blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>For he that will love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips that they speak no guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.11'>And let him avoid evil, and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>because [the] eyes of [the] Lord [are] on [the] righteous, and his ears towards their supplications; but [the] face of [the] Lord [is] against them that do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>And who shall injure you if ye have become imitators of that which [is] good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>But if also ye should suffer for righteousness' sake, blessed [are ye]; but be not afraid of their fear, neither be troubled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>but sanctify [the] Lord the Christ in your hearts, and [be] always prepared to [give] an answer [to] every one that asks you to give an account of the hope that [is] in you, but with meekness and fear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>having a good conscience, that [as to that] in which they speak against you as evildoers, they may be ashamed who calumniate your good conversation in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>For [it is] better, if the will of God should will it, to suffer [as] well-doers than [as] evildoers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>for Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, [the] just for [the] unjust, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in flesh, but made alive in [the] Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>in which also going he preached to the spirits [which are] in prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>heretofore disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in [the] days of Noah while the ark was preparing, into which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>which figure also now saves you, [even] baptism, not a putting away of [the] filth of flesh, but [the] demand as before God of a good conscience, by [the] resurrection of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>who is at [the] right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Christ, then, having suffered for us in [the] flesh, do *ye* also arm yourselves with the same mind; for he that has suffered in [the] flesh has done with sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>no longer to live the rest of [his] time in [the] flesh to men's lusts, but to God's will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>For the time past [is] sufficient [for us] to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, walking in lasciviousness, lusts, wine-drinking, revels, drinkings, and unhallowed idolatries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with [them] to the same sink of corruption, speaking injuriously [of you];</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>who shall render account to him who is ready to judge [the] living and [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>For to this [end] were the glad tidings preached to [the] dead also, that they might be judged, as regards men, after [the] flesh, but live, as regards God, after [the] Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>But the end of all things is drawn nigh: be sober therefore, and be watchful unto prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>but before all things having fervent love among yourselves, because love covers a multitude of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>hospitable one to another, without murmuring;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>each according as he has received a gift, ministering it to one another, as good stewards of [the] various grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>If any one speak as oracles of God; if any one minister as of strength which God supplies; that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the might for the ages of ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved, take not [as] strange the fire [of persecution] which has taken place amongst you for [your] trial, as if a strange thing was happening to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>but as ye have share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, that in the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exultation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>If ye are reproached in [the] name of Christ, blessed [are ye]; for the [Spirit] of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you: [on their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>Let none of you suffer indeed as murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or as overseer of other people's matters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>but if as a christian, let him not be ashamed, but glorify God in this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>For the time of having the judgment begin from the house of God [is come]; but if first from us, what [shall be] the end of those who obey not the glad tidings of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>And if the righteous is difficultly saved, where shall the impious and [the] sinner appear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>Wherefore also let them who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.1'>The elders which [are] among you I exhort, who [am their] fellow-elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ, who also [am] partaker of the glory about to be revealed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.2'>shepherd the flock of God which [is] among you, exercising oversight, not by necessity, but willingly; not for base gain, but readily;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.3'>not as lording it over your possessions, but being models for the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.4'>And when the chief shepherd is manifested ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.5'>Likewise [ye] younger, be subject to [the] elder, and all of you bind on humility towards one another; for God sets himself against [the] proud, but to [the] humble gives grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.6'>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in [the due] time;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.7'>having cast all your care upon him, for he cares about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.8'>Be vigilant, watch. Your adversary [the] devil as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.9'>Whom resist, stedfast in faith, knowing that the selfsame sufferings are accomplished in your brotherhood which [is] in [the] world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.10'>But the God of all grace who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, when ye have suffered for a little while, himself shall make perfect, stablish, strengthen, ground:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.11'>to him [be] the glory and the might for the ages of the ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.12'>By Silvanus, the faithful brother, as I suppose, I have written to you briefly; exhorting and testifying that this is [the] true grace of God in which ye stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.13'>She that is elected with [you] in Babylon salutes you, and Marcus my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.14'>Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with you all who [are] in Christ.</verse>
