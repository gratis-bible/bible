      <chapter osisID='Ezek.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], on the fifth of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>On the fifth of the month, (it was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>And I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the look of glowing brass, out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>Also out of the midst thereof, the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled as the look of burnished brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>And their faces and their wings were parted above; two [wings] of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>And they went every one straight forward: whither the Spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, as the appearance of torches: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright; and out of the fire went forth lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>And I looked at the living creatures, and behold, one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, toward their four faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>The appearance of the wheels and their work was as the look of a chrysolite; and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>Whithersoever the Spirit was to go, they went, thither would [their] spirit go; and the wheels were lifted up along with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>When those went, they went; and when those stood, they stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up along with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>And there was the likeness of an expanse over the heads of the living creature, as the look of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>And under the expanse were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, a tumultuous noise, as the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>and there was a voice from above the expanse that was over their heads. When they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>And above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>And I saw as the look of glowing brass, as the appearance of fire, within it round about; from the appearance of his loins and upward, and from the appearance of his loins and downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spoke unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me unto this very day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>and these children are impudent and hard-hearted: I am sending thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>And they, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are a rebellious house yet shall they know that there hath been a prophet among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, and be not afraid of their words; for briars and thorns are with thee, and thou dwellest among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, and be not dismayed at their faces; for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear; for they are rebellious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>And thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>And I looked, and behold, a hand was put forth toward me; and behold, a roll of a book therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>And he spread it out before me; and it was written within and without; and there were written in it lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>And he said unto me, Son of man, eat what thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll which I give thee. And I ate, and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>For thou art not sent to a people of strange language, and of difficult speech, [but] to the house of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>not to many peoples of strange language and of difficult speech, whose words thou canst not understand: had I sent thee to them, would they not hearken unto thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee, for none of them will hearken unto me. For all the house of Israel are hard of forehead and stiff of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead. Fear them not, neither be dismayed at them, for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>And he said unto me, Son of man, all my words which I shall speak unto thee, receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>and go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>And the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great rushing, [saying,] Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>and the sound of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, and the sound of a great rushing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>And the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>And I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and I sat where they sat; and I sat there astonied among them seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>Son of man, I have appointed thee a watchman unto the house of Israel, and thou shalt hear the word from my mouth, and give them warning from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt certainly die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, that he may live: the same wicked [man] shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>But if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>And when a righteous [man] doth turn from his righteousness, and do what is wrong, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die; because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous acts which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>And if thou warn the righteous [man], that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall certainly live, for he hath taken warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the valley, and there I will talk with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>And I arose, and went forth into the valley, and behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>And the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>And thou, son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee therewith, and thou shalt not go out among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>And when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.1'>And thou, son of man, take thee a brick, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it a city, Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.2'>and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast a mound against it, and set camps against it, and place battering-rams against it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.3'>And take thou unto thee an iron plate, and put it [for] a wall of iron between thee and the city; and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it: this shall be a sign to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.4'>And thou, lie upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: the number of the days that thou liest upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.5'>And I have appointed thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.6'>And when thou hast accomplished them, thou shalt lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.7'>And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.8'>And behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thyself from one side to the other, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.9'>And thou, take unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, [according to] the number of the days that thou liest upon thy side: three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.10'>And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.11'>And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.12'>And thou shalt eat it [as] barley-cake, and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.13'>And Jehovah said, So shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations whither I will drive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.14'>Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, my soul hath not been defiled, and from my youth up even until now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or of that which is torn; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.15'>And he said unto me, See, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.16'>And he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I break the staff of bread in Jerusalem; and they shall eat bread by weight, and with anxiety; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.17'>because bread and water shall fail them, and they shall be astonied one with another, and waste away in their iniquity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.1'>And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife; a barber's razor shalt thou take; and cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard: and thou shalt take balances to weigh, and divide the [hair].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.2'>A third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part, [and] smite about it with a knife; and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.3'>And thou shalt take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.4'>and thou shalt take of these again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire: from it shall a fire come forth against all the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.5'>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This is Jerusalem: I have set her in the midst of the nations, and the countries are round about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.6'>And she hath rebelled against my judgments in wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for mine ordinances have they refused; and my statutes, they have not walked in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.7'>Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have been turbulent more than the nations that are round about you, [and] have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept mine ordinances, nor [even] have done according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.8'>therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.9'>and I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.10'>Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter to all the winds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.11'>Wherefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, verily because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also withdraw mine eye, and it shall not spare, nor will I have any pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.12'>A third part of thee shall die by the pestilence, and shall be consumed by the famine in the midst of thee; and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part to all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.13'>And mine anger shall be accomplished, and I will satisfy my fury upon them, and I will comfort myself; and they shall know that I Jehovah have spoken in my jealousy, when I have accomplished my fury upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.14'>And I will make thee a waste and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.15'>And it shall be a reproach, and a taunt, an instruction, and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments upon thee in anger, and in fury, and in furious rebukes: I, Jehovah, have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.16'>When I send upon them the evil arrows of famine, that are for [their] destruction, which I send to destroy you, then will I increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.17'>And I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, which shall bereave thee of children; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee: I, Jehovah, have spoken.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.1'>And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.2'>Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.3'>and say, Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the water-courses and to the valleys: Behold, I, [even] I, do bring a sword upon you, and will destroy your high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.4'>And your altars shall be desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain [men] before your idols;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.5'>and I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.6'>In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your sun-images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.7'>And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.8'>Yet will I leave a remnant, in that ye shall have some escaped from the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.9'>And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they have been carried captives, when I shall have broken their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols; and they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed, in all their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.10'>And they shall know that I [am] Jehovah: I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.11'>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the abominations of the iniquities of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.12'>He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that is left, and is besieged, shall die by the famine: and I will accomplish my fury upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.13'>And ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah, when their slain shall be among their idols, round about their altars, upon every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick terebinth, the places where they offered sweet savour to all their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.14'>And I will stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness of Diblath, in all their dwellings; and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.5'>Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long, because of great waters, when he shot forth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.12'>And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off and have left him; upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken in all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.13'>Upon his fallen [trunk] do all the fowl of the heavens dwell, and all the beasts of the field are upon his branches:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.16'>I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol, with them that go down into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the lower parts of the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.1'>And thou, son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.2'>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha! and, The ancient high places are become ours in possession;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.3'>therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because, yea, because they have made [you] desolate, and have swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the remnant of the nations, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and in the defaming of the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.4'>therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the water-courses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which are become a prey and a derision to the remnant of the nations that are round about,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.5'>therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the remnant of the nations, and against the whole of Edom, which have appointed my land unto themselves for a possession with the joy of all [their] heart, with despite of soul, to plunder it by pillage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.6'>Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the water-courses and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the ignominy of the nations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.7'>therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I have lifted up my hand, [saying,] Verily the nations that are about you, they shall bear their shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.8'>And ye mountains of Israel shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel: for they are at hand to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.9'>For behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.10'>And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, the whole of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.11'>And I will multiply upon you man and beast, and they shall increase and bring forth fruit; and I will cause you to be inhabited as [in] your former times, yea, I will make it better than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.12'>And I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.13'>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because they say unto you, Thou devourest men, and hast bereaved thy nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.14'>therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nation any more, saith the Lord Jehovah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.15'>neither will I cause thee to hear the ignominy of the nations any more, and thou shalt not bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nation to fall any more, saith the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.16'>And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.17'>Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a woman in her separation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.18'>And I poured out my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.19'>And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.20'>And when they came to the nations whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when it was said of them, These are the people of Jehovah, and they are gone forth out of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.21'>But I had pity for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations whither they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.22'>Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations whither ye went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.23'>And I will hallow my great name, which was profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I [am] Jehovah, saith the Lord Jehovah, when I shall be hallowed in you before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.24'>And I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.25'>And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your uncleannesses and from all your idols will I cleanse you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.26'>And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.27'>And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances, and ye shall do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.28'>And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.29'>And I will save you from all your uncleannesses; and I will call for the corn and will multiply it, and lay no famine upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.30'>And I will multiply the fruit of the trees and the increase of the field, so that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.31'>And ye shall remember your evil ways, and your doings which were not good, and shall loathe yourselves for your iniquities and for your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.32'>Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord Jehovah, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.33'>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities I will also cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.34'>And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.35'>And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities [are] fortified [and] inhabited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.36'>And the nations that shall be left round about you shall know that I Jehovah build the ruined places [and] plant that which was desolate: I Jehovah have spoken, and I will do [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.37'>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it unto them; I will increase them with men like a flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.38'>As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her set feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.37'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.1'>The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and Jehovah carried me out in the Spirit, and set me down in the midst of a valley; and it was full of bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.2'>And he caused me to pass by them round about; and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and behold, they were very dry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.3'>And he said unto me, Son of man, Shall these bones live? And I said, Lord Jehovah, thou knowest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.4'>And he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.5'>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.6'>And I will put sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live: and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.7'>And I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a rustling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.8'>And I looked, and behold, sinews and flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them over; but there was no breath in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.9'>And he said unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.10'>And I prophesied as he had commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.11'>And he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.12'>Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people, and bring you into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.13'>And ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, and have caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.14'>And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I Jehovah have spoken, and have done [it], saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.15'>And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.16'>And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel, his companions. And take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and all the house of Israel, his companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.17'>And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.18'>And when the children of my people speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not declare unto us what thou meanest by these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.19'>say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions, and will put them with this, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.20'>And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.21'>And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them from every side, and bring them into their own land:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.22'>and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.23'>And they shall not defile themselves any more with their idols, or with their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions; and I will save them out of all their dwelling-places wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.24'>And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: and they shall walk in mine ordinances, and keep my statutes, and do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.25'>And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.26'>And I will make a covenant of peace with them: it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.27'>And my tabernacle shall be over them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.37.28'>And the nations shall know that I Jehovah do hallow Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.38.1'>And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.1'>In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, on that same day the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.2'>In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain; and upon it was as the building of a city, on the south.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.5'>And behold, there was a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring-reed of six cubits, [each] of one cubit and a hand breadth. And he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.6'>And he came to the gate which looked toward the east, and went up its steps; and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold one reed broad.</verse>
