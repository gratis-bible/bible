      <chapter osisID='Hos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.1'>The word of Jehovah that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.2'>The beginning of the word of Jehovah through Hosea. And Jehovah said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms, and children of whoredoms; for the land is entirely given up to whoredom, away from Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.3'>And he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived and bore him a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.4'>And Jehovah said unto him, Call his name Jizreel; for yet a little, and I will visit the blood of Jizreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.5'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jizreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.6'>And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And he said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah; for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, so that I should pardon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.7'>But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by Jehovah their God; and I will not save them by bow, or by sword, or by battle, [or] by horses, or by horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.8'>And she weaned Lo-ruhamah; and she conceived and bore a son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.9'>and he said, Call his name Lo-ammi; for ye are not my people, and I will not be for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.10'>Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea which cannot be measured or numbered; and it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, it shall be said unto them, Sons of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.11'>And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up out of the land: for great is the day of Jizreel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.1'>Say unto your brethren Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.2'>Plead with your mother, plead; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: and let her put away her whoredoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.3'>lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her as a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.4'>And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they are the children of whoredoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.5'>For their mother hath played the harlot; she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give [me] my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.6'>Therefore behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns; and I will fence [her] in with a wall, that she shall not find her paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.7'>And she shall pursue after her lovers, and shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, and shall not find them: and she shall say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then was it better with me than now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.8'>And she did not know that I had given her the corn and the new wine and the oil, and had multiplied to her the silver and gold, which they employed for Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.9'>Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my new wine in its season, and will withdraw my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.10'>And now will I discover her impiety in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.11'>And I will cause all her mirth to cease: her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths! and all her solemnities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.12'>And I will make desolate her vine and her fig-tree, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards which my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.13'>And I will visit upon her the days of the Baals, wherein she burned incense to them, and decked herself with her rings and jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.14'>Therefore behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak to her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.15'>And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.16'>And it shall be in that day, saith Jehovah, [that] thou shalt call me, My husband, and shalt call me no more, Baali;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.17'>for I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.18'>And I will make a covenant for them in that day with the beasts of the field, and with the fowl of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground; and I will break bow and sword and battle out of the land; and I will make them to lie down safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.19'>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; and I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.20'>and I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.21'>And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith Jehovah, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.22'>and the earth shall hear the corn, and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jizreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.23'>And I will sow her unto me in the land; and I will have mercy upon Lo-ruhamah; and I will say to Lo-ammi, Thou art my people; and they shall say, My God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.1'>And Jehovah said unto me, Go again, love a woman beloved of a friend, and an adulteress, according to the love of Jehovah for the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love raisin-cakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.2'>So I bought her to me for fifteen silver [pieces], and for a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.3'>And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be [another] man's, and I will also be for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.4'>For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without statue, and without ephod and teraphim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.5'>Afterwards shall the children of Israel return, and seek Jehovah their God, and David their king; and shall turn with fear toward Jehovah and toward his goodness, at the end of the days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.1'>Hear the word of Jehovah, ye children of Israel; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land; for there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.2'>Swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out; and blood toucheth blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.3'>For this shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowl of the heavens, yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.4'>Yet let no man strive, and let no man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.5'>And thou shalt stumble by day; and the prophet also shall stumble with thee by night: and I will destroy thy mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.6'>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; for thou hast rejected knowledge, and I will reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me; seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.7'>As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.8'>They eat the sin of my people, and their soul longeth for their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.9'>And it shall be as the people so the priest; and I will visit their ways upon them, and recompense to them their doings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.10'>and they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: for they have left off taking heed to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.11'>Fornication, and wine, and new wine take away the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.12'>My people ask counsel of their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of whoredoms causeth [them] to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.13'>they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oak and poplar and terebinth, because the shade thereof is good; therefore your daughters play the harlot and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.14'>I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your daughters-in-law for their committing adultery; for they themselves go aside with harlots, and they sacrifice with prostitutes: and the people that doth not understand shall come to ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.15'>Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, let not Judah trespass; and come ye not unto Gilgal, neither go up to Beth-aven, nor swear [As] Jehovah liveth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.16'>For Israel is refractory as an untractable heifer; now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a wide [pasture].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.17'>Ephraim is joined to idols: leave him alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.18'>Their drink is sour; they give themselves up to whoredom; her great men passionately love [their] shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.19'>The wind hath wrapped her up in its wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.1'>Hear this, ye priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ear, O house of the king: for this judgment is for you; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.2'>And they have plunged themselves in the corruption of apostasy, but I will be a chastiser of them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.3'>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, Ephraim, thou hast committed whoredom; Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.4'>Their doings do not allow them to return unto their God; for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they know not Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.5'>And Israel's pride doth testify to his face; and Israel and Ephraim shall fall by their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.6'>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find [him]: he hath withdrawn himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.7'>They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have begotten strange children: now shall the new moon devour them, with their allotted possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.8'>Blow the horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah; cry aloud [at] Beth-aven: behind thee, O Benjamin!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.9'>Ephraim shall be a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which is sure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.10'>The princes of Judah are become like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.11'>Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, because in selfwill he walked after the commandment [of man].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.12'>And I will be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.13'>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his sore, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb; but he was unable to heal you, nor hath he removed your sore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.14'>For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah. I, I will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.15'>I will go away, I will return to my place, till they acknowledge their trespass, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.1'>Come and let us return unto Jehovah: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.2'>After two days will he revive us; on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before his face;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.3'>and we shall know, we shall follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is assured as the morning dawn; and he will come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain which watereth the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.4'>What shall I do unto thee, Ephraim? What shall I do unto thee, Judah? For your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that early passeth away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.5'>Therefore have I hewed [them] by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and my judgment goeth forth as the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.6'>For I delight in loving-kindness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.7'>But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.8'>Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity; it is tracked with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.9'>And as troops of robbers lie in wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way of Shechem; yea, they commit lewdness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.10'>In the house of Israel have I seen a horrible thing: the whoredom of Ephraim is there; Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.11'>Also, for thee, Judah, is a harvest appointed, when I shall turn again the captivity of my people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.1'>When I would heal Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim is discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they practise falsehood; and the thief entereth in, [and] the troop of robbers assaileth without.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.2'>And they say not in their hearts [that] I remember all their wickedness: now do their own doings encompass them; they are before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.3'>They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.4'>They all practise adultery, as an oven heated by the baker: he ceaseth from stirring [the fire] after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.5'>In the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine: he stretched out his hand to scorners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.6'>For they have applied their heart like an oven to their lying in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth like a flaming fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.7'>They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.8'>Ephraim, he mixeth himself with the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.9'>Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth [it] not; yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth [it] not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.10'>And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face; and they do not return to Jehovah their God, nor seek him for all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.11'>And Ephraim is become like a silly dove without understanding: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.12'>When they go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowl of the heavens; I will chastise them, according as their assembly hath heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.13'>Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have transgressed against me. And I would redeem them; but they speak lies against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.14'>And they cried not unto me in their heart, when they howled upon their beds; they assemble themselves for corn and new wine; they have turned aside from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.15'>I have indeed trained, I have strengthened their arms, but they imagine mischief against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.16'>They return, [but] not to the [Most] High: they are like a deceitful bow. Their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.1'>Set the trumpet to thy mouth. [He cometh] as an eagle against the house of Jehovah, because they have transgressed my covenant, and rebelled against my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.2'>They shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee; [we], Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.3'>Israel hath cast off good: the enemy shall pursue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.4'>They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not; of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.5'>Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast [thee] off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will they be incapable of purity?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.6'>For from Israel is this also: a workman made it, and it is no God: for the calf of Samaria shall be [broken in] pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.7'>For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk; should it sprout, it would yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.8'>Israel is swallowed up: now are they become among the nations as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.9'>For they are gone up [to] Assyria [as] a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.10'>Although they hire among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall begin to be straitened under the burden of the king of princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.11'>Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.12'>I have prescribed unto him the manifold things of my law: they are counted [as] a strange thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.13'>They sacrifice flesh [for] the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; Jehovah hath no delight in them. Now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.14'>For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.9'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.1'>Rejoice not, Israel, exultingly, as the peoples; for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved harlot's hire upon every corn-floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.2'>The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.3'>They shall not dwell in Jehovah's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and in Assyria shall they eat that which is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.4'>They shall pour out no [offerings of] wine to Jehovah, neither shall their sacrifices be pleasing unto him: they shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be defiled: for their bread shall be for themselves; it shall not come into the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.5'>What will ye do in the day of assembly, and in the day of the feast of Jehovah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.6'>For behold, they are gone away because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Moph shall bury them: their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them; thorns shall be in their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.7'>The days of visitation are come; the days of recompence are come: Israel shall know [it]: the prophet is a fool, the inspired man is mad, because of the greatness of thine iniquity, and the great enmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.8'>Is Ephraim a watchman with my God? [nay] the prophet is a fowler's snare on all his ways, enmity in the house of his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.9'>They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</verse>
