      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, [a] called apostle of Jesus Christ, by God's will, and Sosthenes the brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to [those] sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word [of doctrine], and all knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>(according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who shall also confirm you to [the] end, unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God [is] faithful, by whom ye have been called into [the] fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all say the same thing, and that there be not among you divisions; but that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same opinion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it has been shewn to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of [the house of] Chloe, that there are strifes among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>But I speak of this, that each of you says, *I* am of Paul, and *I* of Apollos, and *I* of Cephas, and *I* of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is the Christ divided? has Paul been crucified for you? or have ye been baptised unto the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I thank God that I have baptised none of you, unless Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>that no one may say that I have baptised unto my own name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>Yes, I baptised also the house of Stephanas; for the rest I know not if I have baptised any other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ has not sent me to baptise, but to preach glad tidings; not in wisdom of word, that the cross of the Christ may not be made vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God's power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and set aside the understanding of the understanding ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where [is the] wise? where scribe? where disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom has not known God, God has been pleased by the foolishness of the preaching to save those that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>Since Jews indeed ask for signs, and Greeks seek wisdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but *we* preach Christ crucified, to Jews an offence, and to nations foolishness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to those that [are] called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ God's power and God's wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For consider your calling, brethren, that [there are] not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many high-born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that he may put to shame the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world, that he may put to shame the strong things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>and the ignoble things of the world, and the despised, has God chosen, [and] things that are not, that he may annul the things that are;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>so that no flesh should boast before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But of him are *ye* in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>that according as it is written, He that boasts, let him boast in [the] Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And *I*, when I came to you, brethren, came not in excellency of word, or wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I did not judge [it well] to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And *I* was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>and my word and my preaching, not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of [the] Spirit and of power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>that your faith might not stand in men's wisdom, but in God's power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>But we speak wisdom among the perfect; but wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who come to nought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>But we speak God's wisdom in [a] mystery, that hidden [wisdom] which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>which none of the princes of this age knew, (for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>but according as it is written, Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>but God has revealed to us by [his] Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For who of men hath known the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? thus also the things of God knows no one except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>But *we* have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which [is] of God, that we may know the things which have been freely given to us of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, communicating spiritual [things] by spiritual [means].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But [the] natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him; and he cannot know [them] because they are spiritually discerned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>but the spiritual discerns all things, and *he* is discerned of no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For who has known the mind of [the] Lord, who shall instruct him? But *we* have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And *I*, brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I have given you milk to drink, not meat, for ye have not yet been able, nor indeed are ye yet able;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>for ye are yet carnal. For whereas [there are] among you emulation and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For when one says, *I* am of Paul, and another, *I* of Apollos, are ye not men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>Who then is Apollos, and who Paul? Ministering servants, through whom ye have believed, and as the Lord has given to each.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>*I* have planted; Apollos watered; but God has given the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So that neither the planter is anything, nor the waterer; but God the giver of the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>But the planter and the waterer are one; but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are God's fellow-workmen; ye are God's husbandry, God's building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God which has been given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation, but another builds upon it. But let each see how he builds upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For other foundation can no man lay besides that which [is] laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>Now if any one build upon [this] foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>the work of each shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare [it], because it is revealed in fire; and the fire shall try the work of each what it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If the work of any one which he has built upon [the foundation] shall abide, he shall receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If the work of any one shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but *he* shall be saved, but so as through [the] fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Do ye not know that ye are [the] temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If any one corrupt the temple of God, *him* shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are *ye*.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself: if any one thinks himself to be wise among you in this world, let him become foolish, that he may be wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, He who takes the wise in their craftiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>And again, [The] Lord knows the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>So that let no one boast in men; for all things are yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or [the] world, or life, or death, or things present, or things coming, all are yours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and *ye* [are] Christ's, and Christ [is] God's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ, and stewards of [the] mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Here, further, it is sought in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But for me it is the very smallest matter that I be examined of you or of man's day. Nor do I even examine myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For I am conscious of nothing in myself; but I am not justified by this: but he that examines me is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>So that do not judge anything before [the] time, until the Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and shall make manifest the counsels of hearts; and then shall each have [his] praise from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>Now these things, brethren, I have transferred, in their application, to myself and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye may learn in us the [lesson of] not [letting your thoughts go] above what is written, that ye may not be puffed up one for [such a] one against another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who makes thee to differ? and what hast thou which thou hast not received? but if also thou hast received, why boastest thou as not receiving?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Already ye are filled; already ye have been enriched; ye have reigned without us; and I would that ye reigned, that *we* also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For I think that God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death. For we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>*We* [are] fools for Christ's sake, but *ye* prudent in Christ: *we* weak, but *ye* strong: *ye* glorious, but *we* in dishonour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are in nakedness, and buffeted, and wander without a home,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>and labour, working with our own hands. Railed at, we bless; persecuted, we suffer [it];</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>insulted, we entreat: we are become as [the] offscouring of the world, [the] refuse of all, until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>Not [as] chiding do I write these things to you, but as my beloved children I admonish [you].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus *I* have begotten you through the glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>I entreat you therefore, be my imitators.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in [the] Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways [as] they [are] in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>But some have been puffed up, as if I were not coming to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>but I will come quickly to you, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of those that are puffed up, but the power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God [is] not in word, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What will ye? that I come to you with a rod; or in love, and [in] a spirit of meekness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is universally reported [that there is] fornication among you, and such fornication as [is] not even among the nations, so that one should have his father's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And *ye* are puffed up, and ye have not rather mourned, in order that he that has done this deed might be taken away out of the midst of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For *I*, [as] absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged as present,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>[to deliver,] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ), him that has so wrought this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>to deliver him, [I say,] [being] such, to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting [is] not good. Do ye not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened. For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened [bread] of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I have written to you in the epistle not to mix with fornicators;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the avaricious and rapacious, or idolaters, since [then] ye should go out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But now I have written to you, if any one called brother be fornicator, or avaricious, or idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or rapacious, not to mix with [him]; with such a one not even to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what have *I* [to do] with judging those outside also? *ye*, do not ye judge them that are within?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>But those without God judges. Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Dare any one of you, having a matter against another, prosecute his suit before the unjust, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Do ye not then know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy of [the] smallest judgments?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Do ye not know that we shall judge angels? and not then matters of this life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>If then ye have judgments as to things of this life, set those [to judge] who are little esteemed in the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I speak to you [to put you] to shame. Thus there is not a wise person among you, not even one, who shall be able to decide between his brethren!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But brother prosecutes his suit with brother, and that before unbelievers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Already indeed then it is altogether a fault in you that ye have suits between yourselves. Why do ye not rather suffer wrong? why are ye not rather defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>But *ye* do wrong, and defraud, and this [your] brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Do ye not know that unrighteous [persons] shall not inherit [the] kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who make women of themselves, nor who abuse themselves with men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor abusive persons, nor [the] rapacious, shall inherit [the] kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And these things were some of you; but ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are lawful to me, but all things do not profit; all things are lawful to me, but *I* will not be brought under the power of any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God will bring to nothing both it and them: but the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>And God has both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up from among [the dead] by his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Do ye not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then, taking the members of the Christ, make [them] members of a harlot? Far be the thought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Do ye not know that he [that is] joined to the harlot is one body? for the two, he says, shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But he that [is] joined to the Lord is one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee fornication. Every sin which a man may practise is without the body, but he that commits fornication sins against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Do ye not know that your body is [the] temple of the Holy Spirit which [is] in you, which ye have of God; and ye are not your own?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>for ye have been bought with a price: glorify now then God in your body.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>But concerning the things of which ye have written [to me]: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>but on account of fornications, let each have his own wife, and each [woman] have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>Let the husband render her due to the wife, and in like manner the wife to the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife has not authority over her own body, but the husband: in like manner also the husband has not authority over his own body, but the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Defraud not one another, unless, it may be, by consent for a time, that ye may devote yourselves to prayer, and again be together, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But this I say, as consenting [to], not as commanding [it].</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>Now I desire that ye should all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy. But greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, unless he interpret, that the assembly may receive edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>And now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I shall speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What is it then, brethren? whenever ye come together, each [of you] has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If any one speak with a tongue, [let it be] two, or at the most three, and separately, and let one interpret;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>And let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>But if there be a revelation to another sitting [there], let the first be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For ye can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>And spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not [a God] of disorder but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>Let [your] women be silent in the assemblies, for it is not permitted to them to speak; but to be in subjection, as the law also says.</verse>
