      <chapter osisID='Gen.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>And the earth was waste and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>And God said, Let there be light. And there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>And God saw the light that it was good; and God divided between the light and the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening, and there was morning the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it be a division between waters and waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>And God made the expanse, and divided between the waters that are under the expanse and the waters that are above the expanse; and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>And God called the expanse Heavens. And there was evening, and there was morning a second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry [land] appear. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>And God called the dry [land] Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>And God said, Let the earth cause grass to spring up, herb producing seed, fruit-trees yielding fruit after their kind, the seed of which is in them, on the earth. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>And the earth brought forth grass, herb producing seed after its kind, and trees yielding fruit, the seed of which is in them, after their kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>And there was evening, and there was morning a third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens, to divide between the day and the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens, to give light on the earth. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>And God made the two great lights, the great light to rule the day, and the small light to rule the night, and the stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>And God set them in the expanse of the heavens, to give light on the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>and to rule during the day and during the night, and to divide between the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>And there was evening, and there was morning a fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living souls, and let fowl fly above the earth in the expanse of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>And God created the great sea monsters, and every living soul that moves with which the waters swarm, after their kind, and every winged fowl after its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>And there was evening, and there was morning a fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>And God said, Let the earth bring forth living souls after their kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth, after their kind. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'>And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing of the ground after its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over the whole earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'>And God created Man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'>And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over every animal that moveth on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb producing seed that is on the whole earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree producing seed: it shall be food for you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>and to every animal of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth on the earth, in which is a living soul, every green herb for food. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'>And God saw everything that he had made, and behold it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning the sixth day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>And the heavens and the earth and all their host were finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>And God had finished on the seventh day his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it, because that on it he rested from all his work which God had created in making it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>These are the histories of the heavens and the earth, when they were created, in the day that Jehovah Elohim made earth and heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>and every shrub of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew; for Jehovah Elohim had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>But a mist went up from the earth, and moistened the whole surface of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>And Jehovah Elohim formed Man, dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a living soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>And Jehovah Elohim planted a garden in Eden eastward, and there put Man whom he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; and the tree of life, in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>And a river went out of Eden, to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four main streams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>The name of the one is Pison: that is it which surrounds the whole land of Havilah, where the gold is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and the onyx stone are there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>And the name of the second river is Gihon: that is it which surrounds the whole land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which flows forward toward Asshur. And the fourth river, that is Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>And Jehovah Elohim took Man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to till it and to guard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>And Jehovah Elohim commanded Man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou shalt freely eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt certainly die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>And Jehovah Elohim said, It is not good that Man should be alone; I will make him a helpmate, his like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim had formed every animal of the field and all fowl of the heavens, and brought [them] to Man, to see what he would call them; and whatever Man called each living soul, that was its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>And Man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but as for Adam, he found no helpmate, his like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>And Jehovah Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon Man; and he slept. And he took one of his ribs and closed up flesh in its stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>And Jehovah Elohim built the rib that he had taken from Man into a woman; and brought her to Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>And Man said, This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'>And they were both naked, Man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>And the serpent was more crafty than any animal of the field which Jehovah Elohim had made. And it said to the woman, Is it even so, that God has said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>but of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it, and ye shall not touch it, lest ye die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>And the serpent said to the woman, Ye will not certainly die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>but God knows that in the day ye eat of it, your eyes will be opened, and ye will be as God, knowing good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a pleasure for the eyes, and the tree was to be desired to give intelligence; and she took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>And they heard the voice of Jehovah Elohim, walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah Elohim, in the midst of the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>And Jehovah Elohim called to Man, and said to him, Where art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I feared, because I am naked; and I hid myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>And he said, Who told thee that thou art naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee not to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>And Man said, The woman, whom thou hast given [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>And Jehovah Elohim said to the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>And Jehovah Elohim said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, be thou cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. On thy belly shalt thou go, and eat dust all the days of thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he shall crush thy head, and thou shalt crush his heel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>To the woman he said, I will greatly increase thy travail and thy pregnancy; with pain thou shalt bear children; and to thy husband shall be thy desire, and he shall rule over thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed be the ground on thy account; with toil shalt thou eat [of] it all the days of thy life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>and thorns and thistles shall it yield thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, until thou return to the ground: for out of it wast thou taken. For dust thou art; and unto dust shalt thou return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>And Man called his wife's name Eve; because she is the mother of all living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>And Jehovah Elohim made Adam and his wife coats of skin, and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>And Jehovah Elohim said, Behold, Man is become as one of us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he stretch out his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever !</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>Therefore Jehovah Elohim sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>And he drove out Man; and he set the Cherubim, and the flame of the flashing sword, toward the east of the garden of Eden, to guard the way to the tree of life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>And Man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have acquired a man with Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>And she further bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, but Cain was a husbandman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat. And Jehovah looked upon Abel, and on his offering;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>and upon Cain, and on his offering, he did not look. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>And Jehovah said to Cain, Why art thou angry, and why is thy countenance fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>If thou doest well, will not [thy countenance] look up [with confidence]? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door; and unto thee [shall be] his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>And Cain spoke to Abel his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>And now be thou cursed from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield thee its strength; a wanderer and fugitive shalt thou be on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is too great to be borne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the ground, and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a wanderer and fugitive on the earth; and it will come to pass, [that] every one who finds me will slay me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>And Jehovah said to him, Therefore, whoever slayeth Cain, it shall be revenged sevenfold. And Jehovah set a mark on Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, toward the east of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city; and he called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>And to Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael; and Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lemech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>And Lemech took two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the second, Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of those who dwell in tents, and [breed] cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of those who handle the harp and pipe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, the forger of every kind of tool of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>And Lemech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice, Ye wives of Lemech, listen to my speech. For I have slain a man for my wound, and a youth for my bruise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold; Lemech seventy and seven fold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: For God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain has slain him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>And to Seth, to him also was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.47.1'>And Joseph came and told Pharaoh and said, My father and my brethren, and their sheep and their cattle, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.2'>And he took from the whole number of his brethren, five men, and set them before Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.3'>And Pharaoh said to his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.4'>And they said to Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for the sheep that thy servants have, for the famine is grievous in the land of Canaan; and now, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.5'>And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.6'>The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land settle thy father and thy brethren: let them dwell in the land of Goshen. And if thou knowest men of activity among them, then set them as overseers of cattle over what I have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.7'>And Joseph brought Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.8'>And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.9'>And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my sojourning are a hundred and thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they do not attain to the days of the years of the life of my fathers, in the days of their sojourning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.10'>And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.11'>And Joseph settled his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.12'>And Joseph maintained his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to the number of the little ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.13'>And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very grievous; and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan were exhausted through the famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.14'>And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.15'>And when money came to an end in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, saying, Give us bread! for why should we die before thee? for [our] money is all gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.16'>And Joseph said, Give your cattle, and I will give you for your cattle, if [your] money be all gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.17'>And they brought their cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread for horses, and for flocks of sheep, and for herds of cattle, and for asses; and he fed them with bread for all their cattle that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.18'>And that year ended; and they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide [it] from my lord that since [our] money is come to an end, and the herds of cattle are in the possession of my lord, nothing is left before my lord but our bodies and our land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.19'>Why should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be bondmen to Pharaoh; and give seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.20'>And Joseph bought all the soil of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them; and the land became Pharaoh's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.21'>And as for the people, he removed them into the cities, from [one] end of the borders of Egypt even to the [other] end of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.22'>Only the land of the priests he did not buy; for the priests had an assigned portion from Pharaoh, and ate their assigned portion which Pharaoh had given them; so they did not sell their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.23'>And Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and sow the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.24'>And it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give the fifth to Pharaoh, and the four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.25'>And they said, Thou hast saved us alive. Let us find favour in the eyes of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's bondmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.26'>And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, [that] the fifth should be for Pharaoh, except the land of the priests: theirs alone did not become Pharaoh's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.27'>And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they had possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.28'>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred and forty-seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.29'>And the days of Israel approached that he should die. And he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found favour in thine eyes, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.30'>but when I shall lie with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their sepulchre. And he said, I will do according to thy word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.31'>And he said, Swear to me; and he swore to him. And Israel worshipped on the bed's head.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.48'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.1'>And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick. And he took with him his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.2'>And one told Jacob and said, Behold, thy son Joseph is coming to thee. And Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.3'>And Jacob said to Joseph, The Almighty God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.4'>and he said to me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples; and will give this land to thy seed after thee [for] an everlasting possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.5'>And now thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came to thee into Egypt, shall be mine: Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.6'>And thy family which thou hast begotten after them shall be thine: they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.7'>And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was yet a certain distance to come to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath, that is, Bethlehem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.8'>And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.9'>And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, to me, that I may bless them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.10'>But the eyes of Israel were heavy from age: he could not see. And he brought them nearer to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.11'>And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face; and behold, God has let me see also thy seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.12'>And Joseph brought them out from his knees, and bowed down with his face to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.13'>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought [them] near to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.14'>But Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid [it] on Ephraim's head now he was the younger and his left hand on Manasseh's head; guiding his hands intelligently, for Manasseh was the firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.15'>And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God that shepherded me all my life long to this day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.16'>the Angel that redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the land!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.17'>When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it was evil in his eyes; and he took hold of his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.18'>And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn: put thy right hand on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.19'>But his father refused and said, I know, my son, I know: he also will become a people, and he also will be great; but truly his younger brother will be greater than he; and his seed will become the fulness of nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.20'>And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and Manasseh! And he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.21'>And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; and God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.22'>And *I* have given to thee one tract [of land] above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.49'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.1'>And Jacob called his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, and I will tell you what will befall you at the end of days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.2'>Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob, And listen to Israel your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.3'>Reuben, thou art my firstborn, My might, and the firstfruits of my vigour: Excellency of dignity, and excellency of strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.4'>Impetuous as the waters, thou shalt have no pre-eminence; Because thou wentest up to thy father's couch: Then defiledst thou [it]: he went up to my bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.5'>Simeon and Levi are brethren: Instruments of violence their swords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.6'>My soul, come not into their council; Mine honour, be not united with their assembly; For in their anger they slew men, And in their wantonness houghed oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.7'>Cursed be their anger, for it [was] violent; And their rage, for it [was] cruel! I will divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.8'>Judah [as to] thee, thy brethren will praise thee; Thy hand will be upon the neck of thine enemies; Thy father's children will bow down to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.9'>Judah is a young lion; From the prey, my son, thou art gone up. He stoopeth, he layeth himself down as a lion, And as a lioness: who will rouse him up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.10'>The scepter will not depart from Judah, Nor the lawgiver from between his feet, Until Shiloh come, And to him will be the obedience of peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.11'>He bindeth his foal to the vine, And his ass's colt to the choice vine; He washeth his dress in wine, And his garment in the blood of grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.12'>The eyes are red with wine, And the teeth [are] white with milk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.13'>Zebulun will dwell at the shore of the seas; Yea, he will be at the shore of the ships, And his side [toucheth] upon Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.14'>Issachar is a bony ass, Crouching down between two hurdles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.15'>And he saw the rest that it was good, And the land that it was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And was a tributary servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.16'>Dan will judge his people, As another of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.17'>Dan will be a serpent on the way, A horned snake on the path, Which biteth the horse's heels, So that the rider falleth backwards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.18'>I wait for thy salvation, O Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.19'>Gad troops will rush upon him; But he will rush upon the heel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.20'>Out of Asher, his bread shall be fat, And he will give royal dainties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.21'>Naphtali is a hind let loose; He giveth goodly words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.22'>Joseph is a fruitful bough; A fruitful bough by a well; [His] branches shoot over the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.23'>The archers have provoked him, And shot at, and hated him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.24'>But his bow abideth firm, And the arms of his hands are supple By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob. From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.25'>From the God of thy father, and he will help thee; And from the Almighty, and he will bless thee With blessings of heaven from above, With blessings of the deep that lieth under, With blessings of the breast and of the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.26'>The blessings of thy father surpass the blessings of my ancestors, Unto the bounds of the everlasting hills: They shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.27'>Benjamin [as] a wolf will he tear to pieces; In the morning he will devour the prey, And in the evening he will divide the booty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.28'>All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them; and he blessed them: every one according to his blessing he blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.29'>And he charged them, and said to them, I am gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.30'>in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is opposite to Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought of Ephron the Hittite along with the field for a possession of a sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.31'>There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebecca his wife; and there I buried Leah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.32'>The purchase of the field, and of the cave that is in it, was from the children of Heth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.33'>And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered his feet into the bed, and expired, and was gathered to his peoples.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.50'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.1'>And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.2'>And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. And the physicians embalmed Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.3'>And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.4'>And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favour in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.5'>My father made me swear, saying, Behold, I die; in my grave which I have dug myself in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. And now, let me go up, I pray thee, that I may bury my father; and I will come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.6'>And Pharaoh said, Go up and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.7'>And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the bondmen of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.8'>and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house; only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.9'>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and the camp was very great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.10'>And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan; and there they lamented with a great and very grievous lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father of seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.11'>And the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing-floor of Atad, and they said, This is a grievous mourning of the Egyptians. Therefore the name of it was called Abel-Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.12'>And his sons did to him according as he had commanded them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.13'>and his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah which Abraham had bought along with the field, for a possession of a sepulchre, of Ephron the Hittite, opposite to Mamre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.14'>And, after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that had gone up with him to bury his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.15'>And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, If now Joseph should be hostile to us, and should indeed requite us all the evil that we did to him!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.50.17'>Thus shall ye speak to Joseph: Oh forgive, I pray thee, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin! for they did evil to thee. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.18'>And his brethren also went and fell down before his face, and said, Behold, we are thy bondmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.19'>And Joseph said to them, Fear not: am I then in the place of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.20'>Ye indeed meant evil against me: God meant it for good, in order that he might do as [it is] this day, to save a great people alive.</verse>
