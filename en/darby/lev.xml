        <verse osisID='Lev.26.32'>And I will bring the land into desolation; that your enemies who dwell there in may be astonished at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.33'>And I will scatter you among the nations, and will draw out the sword after you; and your land shall be desolation, and your cities waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.34'>Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths all the days of the desolation, when ye are in your enemies' land; then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.35'>All the days of the desolation it shall rest, [the days in] which it did not rest on your sabbaths, when ye dwelt therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.36'>And as to those that remain of you I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies, that the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.37'>and they shall stumble one over another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth; and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.38'>And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.39'>And they that remain of you shall waste away through their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also through the iniquities of their fathers shall they waste away with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.40'>And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, through their unfaithfulness wherein they were unfaithful to me, and also that they have walked contrary unto me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.41'>so that I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies. If then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.42'>I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.43'>For the land shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, when it is in desolation without them; and they shall accept the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they despised my judgments, and their soul abhorred my statutes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.44'>And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not despise them, and will not abhor them, to make an end of them utterly, to break my covenant with them, for I am Jehovah their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.45'>But I will remember toward them the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.46'>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lev.27'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.1'>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.27.3'>And thy valuation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old: thy valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.4'>and if it be of a female, thy valuation shall be thirty shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.5'>And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, thy valuation of the male shall be twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.6'>And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, thy valuation of the male shall be five shekels of silver; and for the female thy valuation shall be three shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.7'>And if it be from sixty years old and above, if it be a male, thy valuation shall be fifteen shekels; and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.8'>And if he be poorer than thy valuation, he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him: according to his means that vowed shall the priest value him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.9'>And if it be a beast whereof men bring an offering unto Jehovah, all that they give of such unto Jehovah shall be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.10'>They shall not alter it nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.27.13'>And if they will in any wise redeem it, then they shall add a fifth [part] thereof unto thy valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.14'>And when any one halloweth his house, that it may be holy to Jehovah, the priest shall value it, [judging] between good and bad: as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.15'>And if he that halloweth it will redeem his house, he shall add the fifth of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.16'>And if a man hallow to Jehovah [part] of a field of his possession, thy valuation shall be according to what may be sown in it: the homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.17'>If he hallow his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy valuation shall it stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.18'>but if he hallow his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, until the year of the jubilee; and there shall be a reduction from thy valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.19'>And if he that hallowed the field will in any wise redeem it, he shall add the fifth of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be assured to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.20'>but if he do not redeem the field, or if he sell the field to another man, it cannot be redeemed any more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.21'>and the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy to Jehovah, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.22'>And if he hallow to Jehovah a field that he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.23'>the priest shall reckon unto him the amount of thy valuation, unto the year of the jubilee; and he shall give thy valuation on that day, [as] holy to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.24'>In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought to him to whom the land belonged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.25'>And all thy valuation shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.26'>Only the firstling which is offered as firstling to Jehovah among the cattle, that shall no man hallow, whether it be ox or sheep; it is Jehovah's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.27'>But if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thy valuation, and shall add a fifth of it thereto; and if it be not redeemed, it shall be sold according to thy valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.28'>Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a man hath devoted to Jehovah of all that he hath, of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.29'>Nothing devoted, which shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed: it shall certainly be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.30'>And as to every tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, and of the fruit of the tree, it is Jehovah's: it is holy to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.31'>And if any one will at all redeem of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.32'>And as to every tithe of the herd, or of the flock, of whatever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.33'>He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it; and if he change it at all, then both it and the exchange thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.34'>These are the commandments which Jehovah commanded Moses for the children of Israel upon mount Sinai.</verse>
