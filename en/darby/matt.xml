      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Juda and his brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>and Juda begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom, and Esrom begat Aram,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>and Aram begat Aminadab, and Aminadab begat Naasson, and Naasson begat Salmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>and Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse begat David the king. And David begat Solomon, of her [that had been the wife] of Urias;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>and Solomon begat Roboam, and Roboam begat Abia, and Abia begat Asa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>and Asa begat Josaphat, and Josaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Ozias,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>and Ozias begat Joatham, and Joatham begat Achaz, and Achaz begat Ezekias,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>and Ezekias begat Manasses, and Manasses begat Amon, and Amon begat Josias,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>and Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the carrying away of Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel, and Salathiel begat Zorobabel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>and Zorobabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>and Azor begat Sadoc, and Sadoc begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>and Eliud begat Eliazar, and Eliazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>All the generations, therefore, from Abraham to David [were] fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away of Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the carrying away of Babylon unto the Christ, fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus: His mother, Mary, that is, having been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child of [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>But Joseph, her husband, being [a] righteous [man], and unwilling to expose her publicly, purposed to have put her away secretly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>but while he pondered on these things, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take to [thee] Mary, thy wife, for that which is begotten in her is of [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for *he* shall save his people from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this came to pass that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by [the] Lord, through the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, 'God with us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>But Joseph, having awoke up from his sleep, did as the angel of [the] Lord had enjoined him, and took to [him] his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>and knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod the king, behold magi from the east arrived at Jerusalem, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>Where is the king of the Jews that has been born? for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to do him homage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>But Herod the king having heard [of it], was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>and, assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea; for thus it is written through the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And *thou* Bethlehem, land of Juda, art in no wise the least among the governors of Juda; for out of thee shall go forth a leader who shall shepherd my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod, having secretly called the magi, inquired of them accurately the time of the star that was appearing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>and having sent them to Bethlehem, said, Go, search out accurately concerning the child, and when ye shall have found [him] bring me back word, so that *I* also may come and do him homage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>And they having heard the king went their way; and lo, the star, which they had seen in the east, went before them until it came and stood over the place where the little child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>And when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And having come into the house they saw the little child with Mary his mother, and falling down did him homage. And having opened their treasures, they offered to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>Now, they having departed, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph, saying, Arise, take to [thee] the little child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I shall tell thee; for Herod will seek the little child to destroy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>And, having arisen, he took to [him] the little child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>And he was there until the death of Herod, that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by [the] Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, seeing that he had been mocked by the magi, was greatly enraged; and sent and slew all the boys which [were] in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years and under, according to the time which he had accurately inquired from the magi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>A voice has been heard in Rama, weeping, and great lamentation: Rachel weeping [for] her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But Herod having died, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>Arise, take to [thee] the little child and its mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they who sought the life of the little child are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And he arose and took to [him] the little child and its mother, and came into the land of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>but having heard that 'Archelaus reigns over Judaea, instead of Herod his father,' he was afraid to go there; and having been divinely instructed in a dream, he went away into the parts of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>and came and dwelt in a town called Nazareth; so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, He shall be called a Nazaraean.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>Now in those days comes John the baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he who has been spoken of through Esaias the prophet, saying, Voice of him that crieth in the wilderness: prepare ye the way of [the] Lord, make straight his paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>And John himself had his garment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the country round the Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and were baptised by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of vipers, who has forewarned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Produce therefore fruit worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>And do not think to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for [our] father; for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>And already the axe is applied to the root of the trees; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>*I* indeed baptise you with water to repentance, but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not fit to bear; *he* shall baptise you with [the] Holy Spirit and fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>whose winnowing fan [is] in his hand, and he shall thoroughly purge his threshing-floor, and shall gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptised of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>but John urgently forbad him, saying, *I* have need to be baptised of thee; and comest *thou* to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answering said to him, Suffer [it] now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffers him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And Jesus, having been baptised, went up straightway from the water, and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>and behold, a voice out of the heavens saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was carried up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted of the devil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he hungered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And the tempter coming up to him said, If thou be Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answering said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil takes him to the holy city, and sets him upon the edge of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and says to him, If thou be Son of God cast thyself down; for it is written, He shall give charge to his angels concerning thee, and on [their] hands shall they bear thee, lest in anywise thou strike thy foot against a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, It is again written, Thou shalt not tempt [the] Lord thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again the devil takes him to a very high mountain, and shews him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and says to him, All these things will I give thee if, falling down, thou wilt do me homage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then says Jesus to him, Get thee away, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt do homage to [the] Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil leaves him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>But having heard that John was delivered up, he departed into Galilee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>and having left Nazareth, he went and dwelt at Capernaum, which is on the sea-side in the borders of Zabulon and Nepthalim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>Land of Zabulon and land of Nepthalim, way of [the] sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>the people sitting in darkness has seen a great light, and to those sitting in [the] country and shadow of death, to them has light sprung up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time began Jesus to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>and he says to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And they, having left their trawl-nets, immediately followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And going on thence he saw other two brothers, James the [son] of Zebedee and John his brother, in the ship with Zebedee their father, mending their trawl-nets, and he called them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>and they, having left the ship and their father, immediately followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And [Jesus] went round the whole [of] Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every bodily weakness among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And his fame went out into the whole [of] Syria, and they brought to him all that were ill, suffering under various diseases and pains, and those possessed by demons, and lunatics, and paralytics; and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And great crowds followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judaea, and beyond the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>But seeing the crowds, he went up into the mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>and, having opened his mouth, he taught them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>Blessed [are] the poor in spirit, for *theirs* is the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed they that mourn, for *they* shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed the meek, for *they* shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed they who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for *they* shall be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed the merciful, for *they* shall find mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed the pure in heart, for *they* shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed the peace-makers, for *they* shall be called sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed they who are persecuted on account of righteousness, for *theirs* is the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Blessed are ye when they may reproach and persecute you, and say every wicked thing against you, lying, for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for thus have they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>*Ye* are the salt of the earth; but if the salt have become insipid, wherewith shall it be salted? It is no longer fit for anything but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>*Ye* are the light of the world: a city situated on the top of a mountain cannot be hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Nor do [men] light a lamp and put it under the bushel, but upon the lamp-stand, and it shines for all who are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Let your light thus shine before men, so that they may see your upright works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Think not that I am come to make void the law or the prophets; I am not come to make void, but to fulfil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For verily I say unto you, Until the heaven and the earth pass away, one iota or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whosoever then shall do away with one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whosoever shall practise and teach [them], *he* shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say unto you, that unless your righteousness surpass [that] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not kill; but whosoever shall kill shall be subject to the judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But *I* say unto you, that every one that is lightly angry with his brother shall be subject to the judgment; but whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be subject to [be called before] the sanhedrim; but whosoever shall say, Fool, shall be subject to the penalty of the hell of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>If therefore thou shouldest offer thy gift at the altar, and there shouldest remember that thy brother has something against thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave there thy gift before the altar, and first go, be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Make friends with thine adverse party quickly, whilst thou art in the way with him; lest some time the adverse party deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Verily I say to thee, Thou shalt in no wise come out thence till thou hast paid the last farthing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt not commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But *I* say unto you, that every one who looks upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>But if thy right eye be a snare to thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if thy right hand be a snare to thee, cut it off and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>It has been said too, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a letter of divorce.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But *I* say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, except for cause of fornication, makes her commit adultery, and whosoever marries one that is put away commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Again, ye have heard that it has been said to the ancients, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt render to the Lord what thou hast sworn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But *I* say unto you, Do not swear at all; neither by the heaven, because it is [the] throne of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, because it is [the] footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, because it is [the] city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your word be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; but what is more than these is from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>Ye have heard that it has been said, Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But *I* say unto you, not to resist evil; but whoever shall strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>and to him that would go to law with thee and take thy body coat, leave him thy cloak also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And whoever will compel thee to go one mile, go with him two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>To him that asks of thee give, and from him that desires to borrow of thee turn not away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.5'>and others fell upon the rocky places where they had not much earth, and immediately they sprang up out of [the ground] because of not having [any] depth of earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.6'>but when the sun rose they were burned up, and because of not having [any] root were dried up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.7'>and others fell upon the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.8'>and others fell upon the good ground, and produced fruit, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.9'>He that has ears, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.10'>And the disciples came up and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.32'>which is less indeed than all seeds, but when it is grown is greater than herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.33'>He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it had been all leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.34'>All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without a parable he did not speak to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.35'>so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from [the] world's foundation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.36'>Then, having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.37'>But he answering said, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.38'>and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil [one];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.39'>and the enemy who has sowed it is the devil; and the harvest is [the] completion of [the] age, and the harvestmen are angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.40'>As then the darnel is gathered and is burned in the fire, thus it shall be in the completion of the age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.41'>The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all offences, and those that practise lawlessness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.42'>and they shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.43'>Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.44'>The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid in the field, which a man having found has hid, and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.13'>And if it should come to pass that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoices more because of it than because of the ninety and nine not gone astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.14'>So it is not the will of your Father who is in [the] heavens that one of these little ones should perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.15'>But if thy brother sin against thee, go, reprove him between thee and him alone. If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.17'>But if he will not listen to them, tell it to the assembly; and if also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.18'>Verily I say to you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.19'>Again I say to you, that if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in [the] heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.20'>For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.21'>Then Peter came to him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? until seven times?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.22'>Jesus says to him, I say not to thee until seven times, but until seventy times seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.23'>For this cause the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who would reckon with his bondmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.24'>And having begun to reckon, one debtor of ten thousand talents was brought to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.25'>But he not having anything to pay, [his] lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and his children, and everything that he had, and that payment should be made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.26'>The bondman therefore falling down did him homage, saying, Lord, have patience with me and I will pay thee all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.27'>And the lord of that bondman, being moved with compassion, loosed him and forgave him the loan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.28'>But that bondman having gone out, found one of his fellow-bondmen who owed him a hundred denarii. And having seized him, he throttled him, saying, Pay [me] if thou owest anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.29'>His fellow-bondman therefore, having fallen down [at his feet], besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.30'>But he would not, but went away and cast him into prison, until he should pay what was owing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.31'>But his fellow-bondmen, having seen what had taken place, were greatly grieved, and went and recounted to their lord all that had taken place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.32'>Then his lord, having called him to [him], says to him, Wicked bondman! I forgave thee all that debt because thou besoughtest me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.33'>shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-bondman, as *I* also had compassion on thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.34'>And his lord being angry delivered him to the tormentors till he paid all that was owing to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.35'>Thus also my heavenly Father shall do to you if ye forgive not from your hearts every one his brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.25.43'>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye did not clothe me; ill, and in prison, and ye did not visit me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.44'>Then shall *they* also answer saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or ill, or in prison, and have not ministered to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.45'>Then shall he answer them saying, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye have not done it to one of these least, neither have ye done it to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.46'>And these shall go away into eternal punishment, and the righteous into life eternal.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.26'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>And it came to pass when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.2'>Ye know that after two days the passover takes place, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together to the palace of the high priest who was called Caiaphas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>and took counsel together in order that they might seize Jesus by subtlety and kill him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>but they said, Not in the feast, that there be not a tumult among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>But Jesus being in Bethany, in Simon the leper's house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>a woman, having an alabaster flask of very precious ointment, came to him and poured it out upon his head as he lay at table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>But the disciples seeing it became indignant, saying, To what end [was] this waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>for this might have been sold for much and been given to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>But Jesus knowing [it] said to them, Why do ye trouble the woman? for she has wrought a good work toward me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For in pouring out this ointment on my body, she has done it for my burying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Verily I say to you, Wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world, that also which this [woman] has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then one of the twelve, he who was called Judas Iscariote, went to the chief priests</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>and said, What are ye willing to give me, and *I* will deliver him up to you? And they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And from that time he sought a good opportunity that he might deliver him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>Now on the first [day] of [the feast of] unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>And he said, Go into the city unto such a one, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near, I will keep the passover in thy house with my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>And when the evening was come he lay down at table with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>And as they were eating he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>And being exceedingly grieved they began to say to him, each of them, Is it *I*, Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>But he answering said, He that dips his hand with me in the dish, *he* it is who shall deliver me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of man goes indeed, according as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up; it were good for that man if he had not been born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>And Judas, who delivered him up, answering said, Is it *I*, Rabbi? He says to him, *Thou* hast said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken [the] bread and blessed, broke [it] and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>And having taken [the] cup and given thanks, he gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>For this is my blood, that of the [new] covenant, that shed for many for remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>But I say to you, that I will not at all drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then saith Jesus to them, All *ye* shall be offended in me during this night. For it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after that I shall be risen, I will go before you to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>And Peter answering said to him, If all shall be offended in thee, *I* will never be offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, that during this night, before [the] cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter says to him, If I should needs die with thee, I will in no wise deny thee. Likewise said all the disciples also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and says to the disciples, Sit here until I go away and pray yonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And taking with [him] Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and deeply depressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then he says to them, My soul is very sorrowful even unto death; remain here and watch with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And going forward a little he fell upon his face, praying and saying, My Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me; but not as *I* will, but as *thou* [wilt].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Thus ye have not been able to watch one hour with me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed [is] ready, but the flesh weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again going away a second time he prayed saying, My Father, if this cannot pass [from me] unless I drink it, thy will be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And coming he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>And leaving them, he went away again and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he comes to the disciples and says to them, Sleep on now and take your rest; behold, the hour has drawn nigh, and the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up has drawn nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now he that delivered him up had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, he it is: seize him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And immediately coming up to Jesus he said, Hail, Rabbi, and covered him with kisses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>But Jesus said to him, [My] friend, for what purpose art thou come? Then coming up they laid hands upon Jesus and seized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and smiting the bondman of the high priest took off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then saith Jesus to him, Return thy sword to its place; for all who take the sword shall perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Or thinkest thou that I cannot now call upon my Father, and he will furnish me more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks to take me? I sat daily [with you] teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this is come to pass that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>Now they that had seized Jesus led [him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>And Peter followed him at a distance, even to the palace of the high priest, and entering in sat with the officers to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>And the chief priests and the elders and the whole sanhedrim sought false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>And they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. But at the last two false witnesses came forward</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>and said, *He* said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and in three days build it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And the high priest standing up said to him, Answerest thou nothing? What do these witness against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus was silent. And the high priest answering said to him, I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us if *thou* art the Christ the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus says to him, *Thou* hast said. Moreover, I say to you, From henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has blasphemed: what need have we any more of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What think ye? And they answering said, He is liable to the penalty of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spit in his face, and buffeted him, and some struck him with the palms of their hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, Prophesy to us, Christ, Who is it who struck thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>But Peter sat without in the palace-court; and a maid came to him, saying, And *thou* wast with Jesus the Galilaean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied before all, saying, I do not know what thou sayest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And when he had gone out into the entrance, another [maid] saw him, and says to those there, This [man] also was with Jesus the Nazaraean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>And again he denied with an oath: I do not know the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>And after a little, those who stood [there], coming to [him], said to Peter, Truly *thou* too art of them, for also thy speech makes thee manifest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately [the] cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who had said [to him], Before [the] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went forth without, and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>And when it was morning all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus so that they might put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>And having bound him they led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Judas, who delivered him up, seeing that he had been condemned, filled with remorse, returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>saying, I have sinned [in] having delivered up guiltless blood. But they said, What is that to us? see *thou* [to that].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And having cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, he left the place, and went away and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>And the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, It is not lawful to cast them into the Corban, since it is [the] price of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>And having taken counsel, they bought with them the field of the potter for a burying-ground for strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Wherefore that field has been called Blood-field unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet, saying, And I took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was set a price on, whom [they who were] of the sons of Israel had set a price on,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>and they gave them for the field of the potter, according as [the] Lord commanded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>But Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor questioned him, saying, Art *thou* the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, Thou sayest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>And when he was accused of the chief priests and the elders, he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then says Pilate to him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>And he answered him not so much as one word, so that the governor wondered exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now at [the] feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd, whom they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>And they had then a notable prisoner, named Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom will ye that I release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For he knew that they had delivered him up through envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>But, as he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous [man]; for I have suffered to-day many things in a dream because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should beg for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>And the governor answering said to them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate says to them, What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>And the governor said, What evil then has he done? But they cried more than ever, saying, Let him be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>And Pilate, seeing that it availed nothing, but that rather a tumult was arising, having taken water, washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am guiltless of the blood of this righteous one: see *ye* [to it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>And all the people answering said, His blood [be] on us and on our children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released to them Barabbas; but Jesus, having scourged [him], he delivered up that he might be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus with [them] to the praetorium, gathered against him the whole band,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>and having taken off his garment, put on him a scarlet cloak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>and having woven a crown out of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and, bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And having spit upon him, they took the reed and beat [him] on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And when they had mocked him, they took the cloak off him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And as they went forth they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; him they compelled to go [with them] that he might bear his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And having come to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of a skull,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they gave to him to drink vinegar mingled with gall; and having tasted [it], he would not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And having crucified him, they parted his clothes amongst [themselves], casting lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And sitting down, they kept guard over him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And they set up over his head his accusation written: This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then are crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>But the passers-by reviled him, shaking their heads</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou art Son of God, descend from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>[And] in like manner the chief priests also, mocking, with the scribes and elders, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>He saved others, himself he cannot save. He is King of Israel: let him descend now from the cross, and we will believe on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusted upon God; let him save him now if he will [have] him. For he said, I am Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>And the robbers also who had been crucified with him cast the same reproaches on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from [the] sixth hour there was darkness over the whole land until [the] ninth hour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>but about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>And some of those who stood there, when they heard [it], said, This [man] calls for Elias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>And immediately one of them running and getting a sponge, having filled [it] with vinegar and fixed [it] on a reed, gave him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>But the rest said, Let be; let us see if Elias comes to save him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>And Jesus, having again cried with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And lo, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were rent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>But the centurion, and they who were with him on guard over Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things that took place, feared greatly, saying, Truly this [man] was Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>And there were there many women beholding from afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee ministering to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>among whom was Mary of Magdala, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>Now when even was come there came a rich man of Arimathaea, his name Joseph, who also himself was a disciple to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>*He*, going to Pilate, begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>And Joseph having got the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and laid it in his new tomb which he had hewn in the rock; and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>But Mary of Magdala was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>Now on the morrow, which is after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>saying, Sir, we have called to mind that that deceiver said when he was still alive, After three days I arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Command therefore that the sepulchre be secured until the third day, lest his disciples should come and steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>And Pilate said to them, Ye have a watch: go, secure it as well as ye know how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>And they went and secured the sepulchre, having sealed the stone, with the watch [besides].</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>Now late on sabbath, as it was the dusk of the next day after sabbath, came Mary of Magdala and the other Mary to look at the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of [the] Lord, descending out of heaven, came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>And his look was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>And for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>And the angel answering said to the women, Fear not *ye*, for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>And go quickly and say to his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and behold, he goes before you into Galilee, there shall ye see him. Behold, I have told you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And as they went to bring his disciples word, behold also, Jesus met them, saying, Hail! And they coming up took him by the feet, and did him homage.</verse>
