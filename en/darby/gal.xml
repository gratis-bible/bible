      <chapter osisID='Gal.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>Paul, apostle, not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God [the] Father who raised him from among [the] dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>Grace to you, and peace, from God [the] Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>who gave himself for our sins, so that he should deliver us out of the present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>to whom [be] glory to the ages of ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I wonder that ye thus quickly change, from him that called you in Christ's grace, to a different gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>which is not another [one]; but there are some that trouble you, and desire to pervert the glad tidings of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>But if even *we* or an angel out of heaven announce as glad tidings to you [anything] besides what we have announced as glad tidings to you, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>As we have said before, now also again I say, If any one announce to you as glad tidings [anything] besides what ye have received, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>For do I now seek to satisfy men or God? or do I seek to please men? If I were yet pleasing men, I were not Christ's bondman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>But I let you know, brethren, [as to] the glad tidings which were announced by me, that they are not according to man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>For neither did I receive them from man, neither was I taught [them], but by revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>For ye have heard [what was] my conversation formerly in Judaism, that I excessively persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>and advanced in Judaism beyond many [my] contemporaries in my nation, being exceedingly zealous of the doctrines of my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But when God, who set me apart [even] from my mother's womb, and called [me] by his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations, immediately I took not counsel with flesh and blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>nor went I up to Jerusalem to those [who were] apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter, and I remained with him fifteen days;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>but I saw none other of the apostles, but James the brother of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>Now what I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>But I was unknown personally to the assemblies of Judaea which [are] in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>only they were hearing that he who persecuted us formerly now announces the glad tidings of the faith which formerly he ravaged:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>and they glorified God in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then after a lapse of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with [me];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>and I went up according to revelation, and I laid before them the glad tidings which I preach among the nations, but privately to those conspicuous [among them], lest in any way I run or had run in vain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>(but neither was Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, compelled to be circumcised;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>and [it was] on account of the false brethren brought in surreptitiously, who came in surreptitiously to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>to whom we yielded in subjection not even for an hour, that the truth of the glad tidings might remain with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>But from those who were conspicuous as being somewhat whatsoever they were, it makes no difference to me: God does not accept man's person; for to me those who were conspicuous communicated nothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>but, on the contrary, seeing that the glad tidings of the uncircumcision were confided to me, even as to Peter that of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>(for he that wrought in Peter for [the] apostleship of the circumcision wrought also in me towards the Gentiles,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>and recognising the grace given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were conspicuous as being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas [the] right hands of fellowship, that *we* [should go] to the nations, and *they* to the circumcision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>only that we should remember the poor, which same thing also I was diligent to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to [the] face, because he was to be condemned:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>for before that certain came from James, he ate with [those of] the nations; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those of [the] circumcision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>and the rest of the Jews also played the same dissembling part with him; so that even Barnabas was carried away too by their dissimulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw that they do not walk straightforwardly, according to the truth of the glad tidings, I said to Peter before all, If *thou*, being a Jew, livest as the nations and not as the Jews, how dost thou compel the nations to Judaize?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We, Jews by nature, and not sinners of [the] nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>but knowing that a man is not justified on the principle of works of law [nor] but by the faith of Jesus Christ, *we* also have believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified on the principle of [the] faith of Christ; and not of works of law; because on the principle of works of law no flesh shall be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>Now if in seeking to be justified in Christ we also have been found sinners, then [is] Christ minister of sin? Far be the thought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>For if the things I have thrown down, these I build again, I constitute myself a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For *I*, through law, have died to law, that I may live to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, *I*, but Christ lives in me; but [in] that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness [is] by law, then Christ has died for nothing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O senseless Galatians, who has bewitched you; to whom, as before your very eyes, Jesus Christ has been portrayed, crucified [among you]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>This only I wish to learn of you, Have ye received the Spirit on the principle of works of law, or of [the] report of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are ye so senseless? having begun in Spirit, are ye going to be made perfect in flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>Have ye suffered so many things in vain, if indeed also in vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>He therefore who ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, [is it] on the principle of works of law, or of [the] report of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>Know then that they that are on the principle of faith, these are Abraham's sons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>and the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations on the principle of faith, announced beforehand the glad tidings to Abraham: In thee all the nations shall be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>So that they who are on the principle of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>For as many as are on the principle of works of law are under curse. For it is written, Cursed is every one who does not continue in all things which [are] written in the book of the law to do them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>but that by law no one is justified with God [is] evident, because The just shall live on the principle of faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>but the law is not on the principle of faith; but, He that shall have done these things shall live by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse for us, (for it is written, Cursed [is] every one hanged upon a tree,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>Brethren, (I speak according to man,) even man's confirmed covenant no one sets aside, or adds other dispositions to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>But to Abraham were the promises addressed, and to his seed: he does not say, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed; which is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>Now I say this, A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which took place four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>For if the inheritance [be] on the principle of law, [it is] no longer on the principle of promise; but God gave it in grace to Abraham by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Why then the law? It was added for the sake of transgressions, until the seed came to whom the promise was made, ordained through angels in [the] hand of a mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>But a mediator is not of one, but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>[Is] then the law against the promises of God? Far be the thought. For if a law had been given able to quicken, then indeed righteousness were on the principle of law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>but the scripture has shut up all things under sin, that the promise, on the principle of faith of Jesus Christ, should be given to those that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>But before faith came, we were guarded under law, shut up to faith [which was] about to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>So that the law has been our tutor up to Christ, that we might be justified on the principle of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But, faith having come, we are no longer under a tutor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>for ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>For ye, as many as have been baptised unto Christ, have put on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There is no Jew nor Greek; there is no bondman nor freeman; there is no male and female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>but if *ye* [are] of Christ, then ye are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>Now I say, As long as the heir is a child, he differs nothing from a bondman, though he be lord of all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>but he is under guardians and stewards until the period fixed by the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the principles of the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>but when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, come of woman, come under law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive sonship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>But because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>So thou art no longer bondman, but son; but if son, heir also through God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>But then indeed, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>but now, knowing God, but rather being known by God, how do ye turn again to the weak and beggarly principles to which ye desire to be again anew in bondage?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>Ye observe days and months and times and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I am afraid of you, lest indeed I have laboured in vain as to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>Be as *I* [am], for *I* also [am] as *ye*, brethren, I beseech you: ye have not at all wronged me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>But ye know that in weakness of the flesh I announced the glad tidings to you at the first;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>and my temptation, which [was] in my flesh, ye did not slight nor reject with contempt; but ye received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>What then [was] your blessedness? for I bear you witness that, if possible, plucking out your own eyes ye would have given [them] to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>So I have become your enemy in speaking the truth to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>They are not rightly zealous after you, but desire to shut you out [from us], that ye may be zealous after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>But [it is] right to be zealous at all times in what is right, and not only when I am present with you</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>my children, of whom I again travail in birth until Christ shall have been formed in you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>and I should wish to be present with you now, and change my voice, for I am perplexed as to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, ye who are desirous of being under law, do ye not listen to the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>For it is written that Abraham had two sons; one of the maid servant, and one of the free woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>But he [that was] of the maid servant was born according to flesh, and he [that was] of the free woman through the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>Which things have an allegorical sense; for these are two covenants: one from mount Sinai, gendering to bondage, which is Hagar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>For Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which [is] now, for she is in bondage with her children;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break out and cry, thou that travailest not; because the children of the desolate are more numerous than [those] of her that has a husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>But *ye*, brethren, after the pattern of Isaac, are children of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted him [that was born] according to Spirit, so also [it is] now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>But what says the scripture? Cast out the maid servant and her son; for the son of the maid servant shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>So then, brethren, we are not maid servant's children, but [children] of the free woman.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>Christ has set us free in freedom; stand fast therefore, and be not held again in a yoke of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>Behold, I, Paul, say to you, that if ye are circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>And I witness again to every man [who is] circumcised, that he is debtor to do the whole law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>Ye are deprived of all profit from the Christ as separated [from him], as many as are justified by law; ye have fallen from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>For we, by [the] Spirit, on the principle of faith, await the hope of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any force, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>Ye ran well; who has stopped you that ye should not obey the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>The persuasibleness [is] not of him that calls you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>*I* have confidence as to you in [the] Lord, that ye will have no other mind; and he that is troubling you shall bear the guilt [of it], whosoever he may be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>But *I*, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why am I yet persecuted? Then the scandal of the cross has been done away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>I would that they would even cut themselves off who throw you into confusion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>For *ye* have been called to liberty, brethren; only [do] not [turn] liberty into an opportunity to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>but if ye bite and devour one another, see that ye are not consumed one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>But I say, Walk in [the] Spirit, and ye shall no way fulfil flesh's lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these things are opposed one to the other, that ye should not do those things which ye desire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>but if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, disputes, schools of opinion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revels, and things like these; as to which I tell you beforehand, even as I also have said before, that they who do such things shall not inherit God's kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, fidelity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>meekness, self-control: against such things there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>But they that [are] of the Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>If we live by the Spirit, let us walk also by the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.26'>Let us not become vain-glorious, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.6'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>Brethren, if even a man be taken in some fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest *thou* also be tempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>Bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfil the law of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>For if any man reputes himself to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>but let each prove his own work, and then he will have his boast in what belongs to himself alone, and not in what belongs to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>For each shall bear his own burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Be not deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man shall sow, that also shall he reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>For he that sows to his own flesh, shall reap corruption from the flesh; but he that sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit shall reap eternal life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>but let us not lose heart in doing good; for in due time, if we do not faint, we shall reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>So then, as we have occasion, let us do good towards all, and specially towards those of the household of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>See how long a letter I have written to you with my own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>As many as desire to have a fair appearance in [the] flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not be persecuted because of the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>For neither do they that are circumcised themselves keep the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>But far be it from me to boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom [the] world is crucified to me, and I to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.15'>For [in Christ Jesus] neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision; but new creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.16'>And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace upon them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.17'>For the rest let no one trouble me, for *I* bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.18'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit, brethren. Amen.</verse>
