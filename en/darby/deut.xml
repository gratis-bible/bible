  <div type='book' osisID='Deut'>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.1'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.1'>These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side the Jordan, in the wilderness, in the plain, opposite to Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that Jehovah had given him in command to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.4'>after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt at Ashtaroth [and] at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.5'>On this side the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to unfold this law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>Jehovah our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have stayed long enough in this mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and unto all the neighbouring places in the plain, in the mountain, and in the lowland, and in the south, and by the seaside, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which Jehovah swore unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>And I spoke unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>Jehovah your God hath multiplied you, and behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>Jehovah, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you as he hath said unto you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>How can I myself alone sustain your wear, and your burden, and your strife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.13'>Provide you wise and understanding and known men, according to your tribes, that I may make them your chiefs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.14'>And ye answered me, and said, The thing that thou hast spoken is good [for us] to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.15'>So I took the chiefs of your tribes, wise men and known, and made them chiefs over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers for your tribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.16'>And I commanded your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and him also that sojourneth with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.17'>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment: ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God's; and the matter that is too hard for you shall ye bring to me, that I may hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.18'>And I commanded you at that time all the things that ye should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.19'>And we departed from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw, on the way to the mountain of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God had commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.20'>And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God giveth us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.21'>Behold, Jehovah thy God hath set the land before thee: go up, take possession, as Jehovah the God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.22'>And ye came near to me all of you, and said, We will send men before us, who shall examine the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and of the cities to which we shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.23'>And the matter was good in mine eyes; and I took twelve men of you, one man for a tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.24'>And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.25'>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hand, and brought it down unto us, and brought us answer, and said, The land is good that Jehovah our God hath given us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.26'>But ye would not go up, and rebelled against the word of Jehovah your God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.27'>and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.28'>Whither shall we go up? Our brethren have made our hearts melt, saying, [They are] a people greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.29'>And I said unto you, Be not afraid, neither fear them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.30'>Jehovah your God who goeth before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.31'>and in the wilderness where thou hast seen that Jehovah thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came to this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.32'>But In this thing ye did not believe Jehovah your God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.33'>who went in the way before you, to search you out a place for your encamping, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.34'>And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.35'>None among these men, this evil generation, shall in any wise see that good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.36'>Except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.37'>Also Jehovah was angry with me on your account, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.38'>Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: strengthen him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.39'>And your little ones, of whom ye said, They shall be a prey, and your children, who this day know neither good nor evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.40'>But ye, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.41'>And ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against Jehovah, we will go up and fight, according to all that Jehovah our God hath commanded us. And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and ye would go presumptuously up the hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.42'>And Jehovah said to me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.43'>And I spoke unto you, but ye would not hear, and ye rebelled against the word of Jehovah, and acted presumptuously, and went up the hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.44'>And the Amorite that dwelt on that hill came out against you, and chased you, like as bees do, and cut you in pieces in Seir, as far as Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.45'>And ye returned and wept before Jehovah, but Jehovah would not listen to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.46'>And ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode [there].</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.2'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.1'>And we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as Jehovah had said unto me; and we went round mount Seir many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.2'>And Jehovah spoke to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.3'>Ye have gone round this mountain long enough: turn you northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.4'>And command the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you; and ye shall be very guarded:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.5'>attack them not; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot-breadth; for I have given mount Seir as a possession unto Esau.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.6'>Ye shall buy of them food for money, that ye may eat; and water shall ye also buy of them for money, that ye may drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.7'>for Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand. He hath known thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years hath Jehovah thy God been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.8'>And we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, by the plain, by Elath, and by Ezion-geber, and we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.9'>And Jehovah said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither engage with them in battle; for I will not give thee of their land a possession; for unto the children of Lot have I given Ar as a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.10'>(The Emim dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.11'>They also are reckoned as giants like the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.12'>And in Seir dwelt the Horites in times past; and the children of Esau dispossessed them, and destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did to the land of their possession, which Jehovah gave to them.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.13'>Now rise up, and pass over the torrent Zered. And we passed over the torrent Zered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.14'>Now the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we had come over the torrent Zered, were thirty-eight years; until the whole generation of the men of war was consumed from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah had sworn unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.15'>Moreover the hand of Jehovah was against them to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.16'>And it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed, having died off from among the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.17'>that Jehovah spoke to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.18'>Thou art to pass this day over the border of Moab, [which is] Ar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.19'>and come near over against the children of Ammon; thou shalt not distress them nor attack them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon a possession; for unto the children of Lot have I given it as a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.20'>(That also is reckoned a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in time past, and the Ammonites call them Zamzummim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.21'>a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakim; and Jehovah destroyed them before them, and they dispossessed them, and dwelt in their stead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.22'>as he did to the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, from before whom he destroyed the Horites; and they dispossessed them, and dwelt in their stead, even to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.23'>And the Avvites who dwelt in the hamlets as far as Gazah the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.24'>Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon. Behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land: begin, take possession, and engage with him in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.25'>This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples under the whole heaven; who will hear report of thee, and will tremble, and quake because of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.26'>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon the king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.27'>Let me pass through thy land: by the highway alone will I go; I will neither turn to the right hand nor to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.28'>Thou shalt sell me food for money that I may eat; and thou shalt give me water for money that I may drink; I will only pass through on my feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.29'>as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me, until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which Jehovah our God giveth us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.30'>But Sihon the king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obdurate, that he might give him into thy hand, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.31'>And Jehovah said to me, Behold, I begin to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin, take possession, that thou mayest possess his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.32'>And Sihon came out against us for battle, he and all his people, to Jahaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.33'>But Jehovah our God gave him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and his whole people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.34'>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every city, men, and women, and little ones: we let none escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.35'>Only the cattle we took as booty for ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.36'>From Aroer, which is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the ravine even to Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: Jehovah our God delivered all before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.37'>Only thou didst not approach the land of the children of Ammon, the whole border of the river Jabbok, nor the cities of the mountain, nor to whatsoever Jehovah our God had forbidden us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.3'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.1'>And we turned, and went up the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, for battle at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.2'>And Jehovah said to me, Fear him not; for into thy hand have I given him, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.3'>And Jehovah our God gave into our hand Og the king of Bashan also, and all his people; and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.4'>And we took all his cities at that time: there was not a town which we took not from them, sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.5'>All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides unwalled towns very many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.6'>And we utterly destroyed them, as we had done to Sihon the king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every city, men, women and little ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.7'>But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took as booty for ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.8'>And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites, that were on this side the Jordan, from the river Arnon to mount Hermon</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.9'>(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir):</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.10'>all the cities of the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, as far as Salchah and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.11'>For only Og the king of Bashan remained of the residue of giants: behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? its length was nine cubits, and its breadth four cubits, after the cubit of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.12'>And this land we took in possession at that time. From Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and the half of mount Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.13'>and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob, even all Bashan, is called a land of giants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.14'>Jair the son of Manasseh took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and called Bashan after his own name, Havoth-Jair, to this day.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.15'>And I gave Gilead to Machir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.16'>And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the river Arnon, the middle of the ravine and its border, as far as the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.17'>the plain also, and the Jordan, and [its] border from Chinnereth as far as the sea of the plain, the salt sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.18'>And I commanded you at that time, saying, Jehovah your God hath given you this land to take possession of it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all [who are] combatants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.19'>Only your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, I know that ye have much cattle, shall abide in your cities which I have given you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.20'>until Jehovah give rest to your brethren, as well as to you, and they also take possession of the land that Jehovah your God giveth them beyond the Jordan; then shall ye return, each man to his possession, which I have given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.21'>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done to these two kings: so will Jehovah do to all the kingdoms to which thou shalt go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.22'>Ye shall not fear them; for Jehovah your God, he will fight for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.23'>And I besought Jehovah at that time, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.24'>Lord Jehovah, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy powerful hand; for what God is in the heavens or in the earth that can do like to thy works, and like to thy might?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.25'>Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.26'>But Jehovah was wroth with me on your account, and did not hear me; and Jehovah said to me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.27'>Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes; for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.28'>But charge Joshua, and encourage him and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall put them in possession of the land which thou shalt see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.29'>And we abode in the valley opposite to Beth-Peor.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.4'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.1'>And now, Israel, hearken to the statutes and to the ordinances which I teach you, to do [them], that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers giveth you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.2'>Ye shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall ye take from it, that ye may keep the commandments of Jehovah your God which I command you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.3'>Your eyes have seen what Jehovah did because of Baal-Peor; for all the men that followed Baal-Peor, Jehovah thy God hath destroyed them from among you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.4'>but ye that did cleave to Jehovah your God are alive every one of you this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.5'>See, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Jehovah my God commanded me, that ye may do so in the land into which ye enter to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.6'>And ye shall keep and do them; for that will be your wisdom and your understanding before the eyes of the peoples that shall hear all these statutes, and say, Verily this great nation is a wise and understanding people.</verse>
