      <chapter osisID='Jer.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.1'>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkijah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.2'>to whom the word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.3'>it came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive, in the fifth month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.4'>And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.5'>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I hallowed thee, I appointed thee a prophet unto the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.6'>And I said, Alas, Lord Jehovah! behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.7'>But Jehovah said unto me, Say not, I am a child; for thou shalt go to whomsoever I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.8'>Be not afraid of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.9'>And Jehovah put forth his hand and touched my mouth; and Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.10'>See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up, and to break down, and to destroy, and to overthrow, to build and to plant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.11'>And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.12'>And Jehovah said unto me, Thou hast well seen; for I am watchful over my word to perform it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.13'>And the word of Jehovah came to me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething-pot, and its face is from the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.14'>And Jehovah said unto me, Out of the north shall evil break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.15'>For behold, I am calling all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith Jehovah, and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.16'>and I will pronounce my judgments against them for all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.17'>Thou, therefore, gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I shall command thee: be not dismayed at them, lest I cause thee to be dismayed before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.18'>And I, behold, I appoint thee this day as a strong city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land; against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.19'>And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to deliver thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.1'>And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.2'>Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.3'>Israel was holiness unto Jehovah, the first-fruits of his increase: all that devour him are guilty; evil shall come upon them, saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.4'>Hear the word of Jehovah, house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.5'>Thus saith Jehovah: What injustice have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and become vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.6'>And they said not, Where is Jehovah, that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us in the wilderness, in a land of deserts and of pits, in a land of drought and of the shadow of death, in a land that no one passeth through, and where no man dwelleth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.7'>And I brought you into a fruitful land, to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof; and ye entered and defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.8'>The priests said not, Where is Jehovah? and they that handled the law knew me not; and the shepherds transgressed against me; and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after [things that] do not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.9'>Therefore will I yet plead with you, saith Jehovah, and with your children's children will I plead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.10'>For pass over to the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there have been such a thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.11'>Hath a nation changed [its] gods? and they are no gods; but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.12'>Be astonished, ye heavens, at this, and shudder; be amazed very much, saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.13'>For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, to hew them out cisterns, broken cisterns that hold no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.14'>Is Israel a bondman? Is he a home-born [slave]? Why is he become a spoil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.15'>The young lions roared against him, they gave forth their voice, and they made his land desolate: his cities are burned, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.16'>Even the children of Noph and Tahapanes have fed on the crown of thy head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.17'>Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, at the time he was leading thee in the way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.18'>And now, what hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor? And what hast thou to do with the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.19'>Thine own wickedness chastiseth thee, and thy backslidings reprove thee: know then and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.20'>For of old thou hast broken thy yoke, [and] burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not serve. For upon every high hill, and under every green tree, thou bowest down, playing the harlot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.21'>And I, I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed; how then art thou turned into the degenerate shoots of a strange vine unto me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.22'>For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much potash, thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.23'>How sayest thou, I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baals? See thy way in the valley, acknowledge what thou hast done a swift dromedary traversing her ways!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.24'>a wild ass, used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind in her desire! In her ardour, who shall turn her away? All they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.25'>Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst. But thou saidst, There is no hope; no, for I love strangers, and after them will I go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.26'>As a thief is ashamed when he is found, so shall the house of Israel be ashamed they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.27'>saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth; for they have turned the back unto me, and not the face; and in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.28'>Where then are thy gods that thou hast made for thyself? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for as the number of thy cities, are thy gods, O Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.29'>Wherefore would ye contend with me? Ye all have transgressed against me, saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.30'>In vain have I smitten your children: they received no correction. Your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.31'>O generation, mark ye the word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel, or a land of thick darkness? Wherefore say my people, We have dominion; we will come no more unto thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.32'>Doth a virgin forget her ornaments, a bride her attire? But my people have forgotten me days without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.33'>How dost thou trim thy way to seek love! Therefore hast thou also accustomed thy ways to wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.34'>Yea, in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor, whom thou didst not encounter breaking in, but [it is found] upon all these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.35'>And thou sayest, Indeed I am innocent; his anger will turn from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee because thou sayest, I have not sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.36'>Why dost thou gad about so much, and change thy way? Thou shalt also be brought to shame by Egypt, as thou wast brought to shame by Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.37'>Thou shalt indeed go forth from her with thy hands upon thy head; for Jehovah hath rejected those thou confidest in, and thou shalt not prosper by them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.1'>They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? Would not that land be utterly polluted? But thou hast committed fornication with many lovers; yet return to me, saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.2'>Lift up thine eyes unto the heights and see, where hast thou not been lain with? In the ways hast thou sat for them, as an Arab in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy fornications and with thy wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.3'>And the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; but thou hast a harlot's forehead, thou refusest to be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.4'>Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the guide of my youth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.5'>Will he keep [his anger] for ever? Will he preserve it perpetually? Behold, thou hast spoken and hast done evil things, and thou art [so] determined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.6'>And Jehovah said unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen what backsliding Israel hath done? She hath gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath committed fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.7'>And I said, After she hath done all these [things], she will return unto me; but she returned not. And her sister Judah, the treacherous, saw [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.8'>And I saw that when for all the causes wherein backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce, yet the treacherous Judah, her sister, feared not, but went and committed fornication also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.9'>And it came to pass through the lightness of her fornication that she polluted the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.10'>And even for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart, but with falsehood, saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.11'>And Jehovah said unto me, Backsliding Israel hath shewn herself more just than treacherous Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.12'>Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith Jehovah: I will not make my face dark upon you; for I am merciful, saith Jehovah; I will not keep [anger] for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.13'>Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against Jehovah thy God, and hast turned thy ways hither and thither to the strangers under every green tree; and ye have not hearkened to my voice, saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.14'>Return, backsliding children, saith Jehovah; for I am a husband unto you, and I will take you, one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.15'>And I will give you shepherds according to my heart, and they shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.16'>And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied in the land and become fruitful, in those days, saith Jehovah, they shall say no more, Ark of the covenant of Jehovah! neither shall it come to mind, nor shall they remember it, nor shall they visit [it]; neither shall it be done any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.17'>At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem; and they shall no more walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.18'>In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel; and they shall come together out of the land of the north, to the land which I caused your fathers to inherit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.19'>And as for me, I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee the pleasant land, the goodly inheritance of the hosts of the nations? And I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from following me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.20'>Surely [as] a woman treacherously departeth from her companion, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.21'>A voice is heard upon the heights, the weeping supplications of the children of Israel; for they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Jehovah their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.22'>Return, backsliding children; I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art Jehovah our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.23'>Truly in vain [is salvation looked for] from the hills, [and] the multitude of mountains; truly in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.24'>But shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.25'>We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us; for we have sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah our God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.1'>If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith Jehovah, return unto me; and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not be a wanderer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.2'>and thou shalt in truth, in justice, and in righteousness swear, [As] Jehovah liveth! and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.3'>For thus saith Jehovah to the men of Judah and Jerusalem: Break up for you a fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.4'>Circumcise yourselves for Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my fury come forth like fire and burn, and there be none to quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.5'>Declare ye in Judah, and cause it to be heard in Jerusalem, and say, and blow the trumpet in the land, cry aloud and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fenced cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.6'>Set up a banner toward Zion; take to flight, stay not! For I am bringing evil from the north, and a great destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.7'>The lion is come up from his thicket, the destroyer of the nations is on his way; he is gone forth from his place, to make thy land desolate; thy cities shall be laid waste, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.8'>For this, gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl! for the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned away from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.9'>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall be amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.10'>And I said, Alas, Lord Jehovah! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.11'>At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind [cometh] from the heights in the wilderness, on the way of the daughter of my people, not for fanning, nor for cleansing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.12'>A wind more vehement than that shall come from me: now will I also pronounce judgments against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.13'>Behold, he cometh up as clouds, and his chariots are as a whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.14'>Wash thy heart, Jerusalem, from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.15'>For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.16'>Inform the nations; behold, make Jerusalem to hear: Besiegers come from a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.17'>As keepers of a field are they against her round about; for she hath been rebellious against me, saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.18'>Thy way and thy doings have procured these [things] unto thee; this is thy wickedness, yea, it is bitter, yea, it reacheth unto thy heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.19'>My bowels! my bowels! I am in travail! [Oh,] the walls of my heart! My heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace: for thou hearest, my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the clamour of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.20'>Destruction upon destruction is proclaimed; for the whole land is wasted: suddenly are my tents laid waste, my curtains, in a moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.21'>How long shall I see the standard, [and] hear the sound of the trumpet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.22'>For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have no intelligence; they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.23'>I beheld the earth, and lo, it was waste and empty; and the heavens, and they had no light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.24'>I beheld the mountains, and lo, they trembled, and all the hills shook violently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.25'>I beheld, and lo, man was not, and all the fowl of the heavens were fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.26'>I beheld, and lo, the fruitful land was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down, before Jehovah, before his fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.27'>For thus saith Jehovah: The whole land shall be a desolation; but I will not make a full end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.28'>For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back therefrom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.29'>At the noise of the horsemen and bowmen, every city fleeth; they go into the thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city is forsaken and no man dwelleth therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.30'>And thou, wasted one, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rendest thine eyes with paint, in vain dost thou make thyself fair: [thy] lovers despise thee, they seek thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.31'>For I hear a voice, as of a woman in travail, anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion: she moaneth, she spreadeth forth her hands, [saying], Woe unto me! for my soul faileth because of murderers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.1'>Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broadways thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be [any] that doeth justice, that seeketh fidelity; and I will pardon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.2'>And if they say, [As] Jehovah liveth! surely they swear falsely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.3'>Jehovah, are not thine eyes upon fidelity? Thou hast smitten them, but they are not sore; thou hast consumed them, they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.4'>And I said, Surely these are the wretched ones, they are foolish; for they know not the way of Jehovah, the judgment of their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.5'>I will go unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they know the way of Jehovah, the judgment of their God; but these have altogether broken the yoke, have burst the bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.6'>Therefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, a wolf of the evenings shall waste them; the leopard lurketh against their cities, every one that goeth out thence is torn in pieces: for their transgressions are multiplied, their backslidings are increased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.7'>Wherefore should I pardon thee? Thy children have forsaken me, and swear by them that are not God. I have satiated them, and they have committed adultery, and they troop to the harlots' house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.5'>For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of Jehovah of hosts; for their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.6'>Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his life; be ye not cut off in her iniquity: for this is the time of Jehovah's vengeance: he shall render unto her a recompence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.7'>Babylon hath been a golden cup in Jehovah's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore have the nations become mad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.8'>Babylon is suddenly fallen and ruined. Howl over her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.9'>We have treated Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country; for her judgment reacheth unto the heavens, and is lifted up to the skies.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.11'>Sharpen the arrows; take the shields. Jehovah hath stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes; for his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it; for this is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance of his temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.12'>Lift up a banner towards the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set the watchmen, prepare the ambushes; for Jehovah hath both devised and done that which he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.13'>Thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, the measure of thy rapacity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.14'>Jehovah of hosts hath sworn by himself, I will assuredly fill thee with men, as with caterpillars; and they shall raise a shout against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.15'>He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.16'>When he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the end of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.17'>Every man is become brutish, so as to have no knowledge; every founder is put to shame by the graven image, for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.18'>They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.19'>The portion of Jacob is not like them; for it is he that hath formed all things: and [Israel] is the rod of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.27'>Lift up a banner in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare nations against her; call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the bristly caterpillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.28'>Prepare nations against her, the kings of the Medes, their governors and all their rulers, yea, all the land of their dominion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.29'>And the land trembleth and is in pain; for the purposes of Jehovah against Babylon do stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.30'>The mighty men of Babylon have ceased to fight, they are sitting in the fortresses; their might hath failed, they are become as women: they have set her dwelling places on fire; her bars are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.31'>Courier runneth to meet courier, and messenger to meet messenger, to announce to the king of Babylon that his city is taken from end to end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.32'>and the passages are seized, and the reedy places are burnt with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.33'>For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor, at the time of its being trodden; yet a little while, and the time of harvest shall come for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.34'>Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel; he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.35'>The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitress of Zion say; and, My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.36'>Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her spring dry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.37'>And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals, an astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.38'>They shall roar together like young lions, growl as lions' whelps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.39'>When they are heated, I will prepare their drink, and I will make them drunken, that they may exult, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.40'>I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.41'>How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth seized! How is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.42'>The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of its waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.43'>Her cities are become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert, a land wherein no one dwelleth, neither doth a son of man pass thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.44'>And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth what he hath swallowed up; and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon is fallen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.45'>Go ye out of the midst of her, my people, and deliver every man his soul from the fierce anger of Jehovah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.46'>lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; for a rumour shall come [one] year, and after that a rumour in [another] year, and violence in the earth, ruler against ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.47'>Therefore behold, days are coming when I will punish the graven images of Babylon; and her whole land shall be put to shame, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.48'>And the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, shall shout aloud over Babylon; for out of the north the spoilers shall come against her, saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.49'>As Babylon caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.50'>Ye that have escaped the sword, go, stand not still: remember Jehovah from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.51'>We are put to shame, for we have heard reproach; confusion hath covered our face: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of Jehovah's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.52'>Therefore behold, days come, saith Jehovah, that I will punish her graven images; and throughout her land the wounded shall groan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.53'>Though Babylon should mount up to the heavens, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.54'>The sound of a cry [cometh] from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.55'>for Jehovah spoileth Babylon, and he will destroy out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like great waters, the noise of their voice resoundeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.56'>For the spoiler is come against her, against Babylon, and her mighty men are taken; their bows are broken in pieces; for Jehovah, the God of recompences, will certainly requite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.57'>And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her governors, and her rulers, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.58'>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly laid bare, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; so that the peoples will have laboured in vain, and the nations for the fire: and they shall be weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.59'>The word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Nerijah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.60'>And Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, all these words that are written against Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.61'>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, see that thou read all these words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.62'>and say, Jehovah, thou hast spoken concerning this place, that thou wilt cut it off, so that none shall dwell in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.63'>And it shall be, when thou hast ended reading this book, [that] thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.64'>and shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise, because of the evil that I will bring upon it: and they shall be weary. Thus far the words of Jeremiah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.52'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.1'>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.2'>And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.3'>For, because the anger of Jehovah was against Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.4'>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, [that] Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem; and they encamped against it, and built turrets against it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.5'>And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.6'>In the fourth month, on the ninth of the month, the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.7'>And the city was broken into: and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden (now the Chaldeans were near the city round about); and they went the way toward the plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.8'>And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.9'>And they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon, unto Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he pronounced judgment upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.10'>And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; and he slaughtered also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.11'>And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with chains of brass; and the king of Babylon carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.12'>And in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month, which was in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzar-adan, captain of the body-guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, came unto Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.13'>and he burned the house of Jehovah, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; and every great [man's] house he burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.14'>And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the body-guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.15'>And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard carried away captive of the poorest sort of the people, and the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the deserters that had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.16'>But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard left of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.17'>And the brazen pillars that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of Jehovah, the Chaldeans broke up, and carried all the brass thereof to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.18'>The pots also, and the shovels, and the knives, and the bowls, and the cups, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, they took away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.19'>And the basons and the censers, and the bowls, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the cups, and the goblets, that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, the captain of the body-guard took away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.20'>The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen oxen that formed the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah: for the brass of all these vessels there was no weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.21'>And as to the pillars: the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a line of twelve cubits encompassed it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.22'>And the capital upon it was brass, and the height of the one capital [was] five cubits; and the network and the pomegranates, upon the capital round about, all of brass; and similarly for the second pillar, and the pomegranates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.23'>And there were ninety-six pomegranates on the [four] sides; all the pomegranates upon the network were a hundred round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.24'>And the captain of the body-guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.25'>And out of the city he took a eunuch that was set over the men of war, and seven men of them that were in the king's presence, who were found in the city, and the scribe of the captain of the host, who enrolled the people of the land. And sixty men of the people of the land that were found in the midst of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.26'>And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.27'>and the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.28'>This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand and twenty-three Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.29'>in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar [he carried away captive] from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.30'>in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five persons: all the persons were four thousand six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.31'>And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth of the month, [that] Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.32'>and he spoke kindly unto him, and set his seat above the seat of the kings that were with him in Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.33'>And he changed his prison garments; and he ate bread before him continually all the days of his life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.34'>and his allowance was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</verse>
