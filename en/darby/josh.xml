      <chapter osisID='Josh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'>And it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' attendant, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'>Moses my servant is dead; and now, rise up, go over this Jordan, thou and all this people, into the land which I give unto them, to the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'>Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread have I given to you, as I said unto Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'>From the wilderness and this Lebanon to the great river, the river Euphrates, the whole land of the Hittites, to the great sea, toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'>None shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee; I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'>Be strong and courageous, for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I have sworn unto their fathers to give them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'>Only be strong and very courageous, that thou mayest take heed to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded thee. Turn not from it to the right or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'>This book of the law shall not depart from thy mouth; and thou shalt meditate upon it day and night, that thou mayest take heed to do according to all that is written therein; for then shalt thou have good success in thy ways, and then shalt thou prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'>Have I not commanded thee: Be strong and courageous? Be not afraid, neither be dismayed; for Jehovah thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'>And Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'>Go through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare yourselves victuals, for in three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, that ye may enter in to take possession of the land which Jehovah your God giveth you to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'>And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to half the tribe of Manasseh spoke Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'>Remember the word that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God has given you rest and has given you this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall abide in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan, but ye, all the valiant men, shall go over in array before your brethren and help them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'>until Jehovah give your brethren rest as to you, and they also take possession of the land which Jehovah your God giveth them; then shall ye return into the land of your possession and possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you on this side of the Jordan toward the sun-rising.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'>And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us will we do, and whither thou shalt send us will we go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'>According as we hearkened to Moses in all things, so will we hearken to thee; only may Jehovah thy God be with thee as he was with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'>Every one that is rebellious against thy commandment and hearkeneth not to thy words in everything that thou commandest us, shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'>And Joshua the son of Nun sent from Shittim two spies secretly, saying, Go, see the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into a harlot's house, named Rahab, and they lay down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men have come hither to-night from the children of Israel to search out the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that have come to thee, who have come into thy house: for they have come to search out all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'>And the woman had taken and concealed the two men; and she said, Yes, the men did come unto me, but I knew not whence they were;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'>and it came to pass when the gate had to be closed, at dark, that the men went out: I know not whither the men have gone. Pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'>But she had taken them up to the roof, and secreted them under the stalks of flax, which she had laid out on the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'>And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan, to the fords; and when they who pursued after them had gone out, they closed the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'>And before they had lain down, she went up to them upon the roof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.9'>and said to the men, I know that Jehovah has given you the land, and that the dread of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'>For we have heard that Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red sea before you when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'>We heard [of it], and our heart melted, and there remained no more spirit in any man because of you; for Jehovah your God, he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'>And now, I pray you, swear to me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye will also deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a certain sign,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'>that ye will let my father live, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that belong to them, and deliver our souls from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'>And the men said to her, Our lives shall pay for yours, if ye do not make this our business known; and it shall be when Jehovah shall give us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'>And she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was upon the city-wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'>And she said to them, Go to the mountain, that the pursuers may not meet with you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned; and afterwards go your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'>And the men said to her, We will be quit of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'>Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind in the window this line of scarlet thread by which thou hast let us down; and thou shalt gather to thee in the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'>and it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be innocent; but every one who shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be upon our head, if any hand be upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'>And if thou make known this our business, we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'>And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet line in the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'>And they went, and came to the mountain, and remained there three days, until the pursuers had returned; and the pursuers sought them all the way, and found them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'>And the two men returned and came down from the mountain, and went over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and related to him everything that had happened to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'>And they said to Joshua, Of a surety Jehovah has given the whole land into our hands, and even all the inhabitants of the land faint because of us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'>And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'>And it came to pass at the end of three days, that the officers went through the camp;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'>and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then remove from your place, and go after it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'>yet there shall be a distance between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Ye shall not come near it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'>And Joshua said to the people, Hallow yourselves; for to-morrow Jehovah will do wonders in your midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'>And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and go over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'>And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'>And thou shalt command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, stand still in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'>And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of Jehovah your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'>And Joshua said, Hereby shall ye know that the living God is in your midst, and [that] he will without fail dispossess from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going over before you into the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'>And now take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'>And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan, the waters flowing down from above, shall be cut off, and shall stand up in a heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'>And it came to pass when the people removed from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, that the priests bearing the ark of the covenant were before the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'>and when they that bore the ark were come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water (and the Jordan is full over all its banks throughout the days of harvest),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'>the waters which flowed down from above stood [and] rose up in a heap, very far, by Adam, the city that is beside Zaretan; and those that flowed down towards the sea of the plain, the salt sea, were completely cut off. And the people went over opposite to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'>And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan. And all Israel went over on dry ground, until all the nation had completely gone over the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'>And it came to pass when the whole nation had completely gone over the Jordan, that Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'>Take you twelve men out of the people, one man out of every tribe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'>and command them, saying, Take up hence out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place where ye shall lodge this night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'>And Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had appointed of the children of Israel, a man out of every tribe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'>and Joshua said to them, Pass before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and lift up each of you a stone [and put it] upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'>that this may be a sign in your midst. When your children ask hereafter, saying, What mean ye by these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'>then ye shall say to them, That the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it went through the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'>And the children of Israel did so, as Joshua had commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them to the lodging-place, and laid them down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'>And twelve stones did Joshua set up in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant had stood firm; and they are there to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'>And the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Jehovah had commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hasted and passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'>And it came to pass, when all the people had completely gone over, that the ark of Jehovah went over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'>And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, went over in array before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'>About forty thousand armed for military service passed over before Jehovah to the war, unto the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'>On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.15'>And Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.16'>Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.17'>And Joshua commanded the priests, saying, Come up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.18'>And it came to pass when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah had come up out of the midst of the Jordan, [when] the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up on to the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and they flowed as previously, over all its banks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.19'>And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the eastern extremity of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.20'>And those twelve stones which they had taken out of the Jordan did Joshua set up in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.21'>And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your children hereafter ask their fathers, saying, What [mean] these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.22'>then ye shall let your children know, saying, On dry land did Israel come over this Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.23'>because Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye had passed over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had passed over;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.24'>that all peoples of the earth might know the hand of Jehovah, that it is mighty; that ye might fear Jehovah your God continually.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'>And it came to pass when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until they had passed over, that their heart melted, and there was no spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'>At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make thee stone-knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.3'>And Joshua made him stone-knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of Araloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.4'>And this is the cause why Joshua circumcised [them]: all the people that had come out of Egypt, the males, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way, after they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.5'>For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness on the way, after they came out of Egypt, [them] had they not circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.6'>For the children of Israel had walked forty years in the wilderness, till the whole nation of men of war had perished who had come out of Egypt, who had not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah; to whom Jehovah had sworn that he would not show them the land which Jehovah had sworn unto their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.7'>And their sons [whom] he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.8'>And it came to pass when the whole nation had finished being circumcised, that they abode in their place in the camp, till they were whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.9'>And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. And the name of the place was called Gilgal to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.10'>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and held the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.11'>And they ate of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened loaves, and roasted [corn] on that same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.12'>And the manna ceased on the morrow, when they had eaten of the old corn of the land; and there was no more manna for the children of Israel; and they ate of the produce of the land of Canaan that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.13'>And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there stood a man before him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to him, and said to him: Art thou for us, or for our enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.14'>And he said, No; for [as] captain of the army of Jehovah am I now come. Then Joshua fell upon his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him, What saith my lord unto his servant?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.15'>And the captain of Jehovah's army said to Joshua, Loose thy sandal from off thy foot: for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.1'>Now Jericho was shut up and was barred, because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.2'>And Jehovah said to Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and the king thereof, [and] the valiant men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.3'>And ye shall go round the city, all the men of war, encompassing the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.4'>And seven priests shall carry before the ark seven blast-trumpets; and on the seventh day ye shall go round the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.5'>And it shall come to pass when they make a long blast with the blast-horn, that all the people on hearing the sound of the trumpet shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall flat, and the people shall go up, each one straight before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.6'>And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Carry the ark of the covenant, and seven priests shall carry seven blast-trumpets before the ark of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.7'>And he said to the people, Pass on, go round the city, and they that are armed shall pass on before the ark of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.8'>And it came to pass when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests carrying the seven blast-trumpets before Jehovah passed on and blew with the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.9'>And the armed men went before the priests who blew with the trumpets, and the rearguard came after the ark; they blew with the trumpets in marching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.10'>And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, Shout; then shall ye shout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.11'>And the ark of Jehovah went round the city, encompassing [it] once; and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.12'>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests carried the ark of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.13'>And the seven priests carrying the seven blast-trumpets before the ark of Jehovah went on and blew continually with the trumpets; and the armed men went before them, and the rearguard went after the ark of Jehovah; they blew with the trumpets in marching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.14'>And on the second day they went round the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.15'>And it was so that on the seventh day they rose early, about the morning-dawn, and went round the city after the same manner seven times; only on that day they went round the city seven times.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.24.20'>If ye forsake Jehovah, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.21'>And the people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.22'>And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you Jehovah, to serve him. And they said, [We are] witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.23'>Now therefore put away the strange gods that are among you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.24'>And the people said unto Joshua, Jehovah our God will we serve, and to his voice will we hearken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.25'>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.26'>And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.27'>And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us, for it hath heard all the words of Jehovah which he spoke unto us; and it shall be a witness against you, lest ye deny your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.28'>And Joshua dismissed the people, every man to his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.29'>And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, a hundred and ten years old.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.24.31'>And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua, and who had known all the works of Jehovah, which he had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.32'>And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem in the portion of the field which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred kesitahs; and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.33'>And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which had been given him in mount Ephraim.</verse>
