      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>at the end of these days has spoken to us in [the person of the] Son, whom he has established heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>who being [the] effulgence of his glory and [the] expression of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, having made [by himself] the purification of sins, set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>taking a place by so much better than the angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the angels said he ever, *Thou* art my Son: this day have *I* begotten thee? and again, *I* will be to him for father, and *he* shall be to me for son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>and again, when he brings in the firstborn into the habitable world, he says, And let all God's angels worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>And as to the angels he says, Who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>but as to the Son, Thy throne, O God, [is] to the age of the age, and a sceptre of uprightness [is] the sceptre of thy kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>Thou hast loved righteousness and hast hated lawlessness; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And, *Thou* in the beginning, Lord, hast founded the earth, and works of thy hands are the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They shall perish, but *thou* continuest still; and they all shall grow old as a garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>and as a covering shalt thou roll them up, and they shall be changed; but *thou* art the Same, and thy years shall not fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>But as to which of the angels said he ever, Sit at my right hand until I put thine enemies [as] footstool of thy feet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>For this reason we should give heed more abundantly to the things [we have] heard, lest in any way we should slip away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the word which was spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how shall *we* escape if we have been negligent of so great salvation, which, having had its commencement in being spoken [of] by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who have heard;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>God bearing, besides, witness with [them] to [it], both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of [the] Holy Spirit, according to his will?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For he has not subjected to angels the habitable world which is to come, of which we speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>but one has testified somewhere, saying, What is man, that thou rememberest him, or son of man that thou visitest him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>Thou hast made him some little inferior to the angels; thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, [and hast set him over the works of thy hands;]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in subjecting all things to him, he has left nothing unsubject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to *him*,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>but we see Jesus, who [was] made some little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; so that by the grace of God he should taste death for every thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it became him, for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified [are] all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren; in [the] midst of [the] assembly will I sing thy praises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again, I will trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children which God has given me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Since therefore the children partake of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took part in the same, that through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is, the devil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and might set free all those who through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For he does not indeed take hold of angels [by the hand], but he takes hold of the seed of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like to [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>for, in that himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those that are being tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of [the] heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>who is faithful to him that has constituted him, as Moses also in all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>For *he* has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by how much he that has built it has more honour than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For every house is built by some one; but he who has built all things [is] God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>And Moses indeed [was] faithful in all his house, as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken after;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>but Christ, as Son over his house, whose house are *we*, if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, To-day if ye will hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>where your fathers tempted [me], by proving [me], and saw my works forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>Wherefore I was wroth with this generation, and said, They always err in heart; and *they* have not known my ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>so I swore in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>See, brethren, lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief, in turning away from [the] living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>But encourage yourselves each day, as long as it is called To-day, that none of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we are become companions of the Christ if indeed we hold the beginning of the assurance firm to the end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>in that it is said, To-day if ye will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>(for who was it, who, having heard, provoked? but [was it] not all who came out of Egypt by Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>And with whom was he wroth forty years? [Was it] not with those who had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who had not hearkened to the word?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>And we see that they could not enter in on account of unbelief;)</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you might seem to have failed [of it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For indeed we have had glad tidings presented to us, even as they also; but the word of the report did not profit *them*, not being mixed with faith in those who heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>For we enter into the rest who have believed; as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest; although the works had been completed from [the] foundation of [the] world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For he has said somewhere of the seventh [day] thus, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>and in this again, If they shall enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Seeing therefore it remains that some enter into it, and those who first received the glad tidings did not enter in on account of not hearkening to the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>again he determines a certain day, saying, in David, 'To-day,' after so long a time; (according as it has been said before), To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Jesus had brought them into rest, he would not have spoken afterwards about another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>There remains then a sabbatism to the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For he that has entered into his rest, he also has rested from his works, as God did from his own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Let us therefore use diligence to enter into that rest, that no one may fall after the same example of not hearkening to the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the word of God [is] living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to [the] division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of [the] heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>And there is not a creature unapparent before him; but all things [are] naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities, but tempted in all things in like manner, sin apart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest taken from amongst men is established for men in things relating to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>being able to exercise forbearance towards the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is clothed with infirmity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>and, on account of this [infirmity], he ought, even as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And no one takes the honour to himself but [as] called by God, even as Aaron also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>Thus the Christ also has not glorified himself to be made a high priest; but he who had said to him, *Thou* art my Son, *I* have to-day begotten thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>Even as also in another [place] he says, *Thou* [art] a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up both supplications and entreaties to him who was able to save him out of death, with strong crying and tears; (and having been heard because of his piety;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>though he were Son, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>and having been perfected, became to all them that obey him, author of eternal salvation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>addressed by God [as] high priest according to the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>Concerning whom we have much to say, and hard to be interpreted in speaking [of it], since ye are become dull in hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have again need that [one] should teach you what [are] the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk, [and] not of solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>For every one that partakes of milk [is] unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>but solid food belongs to full-grown men, who, on account of habit, have their senses exercised for distinguishing both good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us go on [to what belongs] to full growth, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>of [the] doctrine of washings, and of imposition of hands, and of resurrection of [the] dead, and of eternal judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>and this will we do if God permit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of [the] Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and have tasted the good word of God, and [the] works of power of [the] age to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and have fallen away, crucifying for themselves [as they do] the Son of God, and making a show of [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For ground which drinks the rain which comes often upon it, and produces useful herbs for those for whose sakes also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>but bringing forth thorns and briars, it is found worthless and nigh to a curse, whose end [is] to be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, better things, and connected with salvation, even if we speak thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work, and the love which ye have shewn to his name, having ministered to the saints, and [still] ministering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>But we desire earnestly that each one of you shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience have been inheritors of the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For God, having promised to Abraham, since he had no greater to swear by, swore by himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>and thus, having had long patience, he got the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For men indeed swear by a greater, and with them the oath is a term to all dispute, as making matters sure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>Wherein God, willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, intervened by an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>that by two unchangeable things, in which [it was] impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>which we have as anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where Jesus is entered as forerunner for us, become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from smiting the kings, and blessed him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>to whom Abraham gave also the tenth portion of all; first being interpreted King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but assimilated to the Son of God, abides a priest continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>Now consider how great this [personage] was, to whom [even] the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And they indeed from among the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is from their brethren, though these are come out of the loins of Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>but he who has no genealogy from them has tithed Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>But beyond all gainsaying, the inferior is blessed by the better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>And here dying men receive tithes; but there [one] of whom the witness is that he lives;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>and, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, who received tithes, has been made to pay tithes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>If indeed then perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, for the people had their law given to them in connexion with *it*, what need [was there] still that a different priest should arise according to the order of Melchisedec, and not be named after the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For, the priesthood being changed, there takes place of necessity a change of law also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For he, of whom these things are said, belongs to a different tribe, of which no one has [ever] been attached to the service of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is clear that our Lord has sprung out of Juda, as to which tribe Moses spake nothing as to priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And it is yet more abundantly evident, since a different priest arises according to the similitude of Melchisedec,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who has been constituted not according to law of fleshly commandment, but according to power of indissoluble life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For it is borne witness, *Thou* art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>For there is a setting aside of the commandment going before for its weakness and unprofitableness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>(for the law perfected nothing,) and the introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And by how much [it was] not without the swearing of an oath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>(for they are become priests without the swearing of an oath, but he with the swearing of an oath, by him who said, as to him, The Lord has sworn, and will not repent [of it], *Thou* [art] priest for ever [according to the order of Melchisedec];)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>by so much Jesus became surety of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>And they have been many priests, on account of being hindered from continuing by death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>but he, because of his continuing for ever, has the priesthood unchangeable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Whence also he is able to save completely those who approach by him to God, always living to intercede for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For such a high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>who has not day by day need, as the high priests, first to offer up sacrifices for his own sins, then [for] those of the people; for this he did once for all [in] having offered up himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the law constitutes men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the swearing of the oath which [is] after the law, a Son perfected for ever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Now a summary of the things of which we are speaking [is], We have such a one high priest who has sat down on [the] right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, [and] not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is constituted for the offering both of gifts and sacrifices; whence it is needful that this one also should have something which he may offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>If then indeed he were upon earth, he would not even be a priest, there being those who offer the gifts according to the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>(who serve the representation and shadow of heavenly things, according as Moses was oracularly told [when] about to make the tabernacle; for See, saith He, that thou make all things according to the pattern which has been shewn to thee in the mountain.)</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For finding fault, he says to them, Behold, days come, saith the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant as regards the house of Israel, and as regards the house of Juda;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>not according to the covenant which I made to their fathers in [the] day of my taking their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because *they* did not continue in my covenant, and *I* did not regard them, saith [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>Because this [is] the covenant that I will covenant to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: Giving my laws into their mind, I will write them also upon their hearts; and I will be to them for God, and *they* shall be to me for people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And they shall not teach each his fellow-citizen, and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; because all shall know me in themselves, from [the] little one [among them] unto [the] great among them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>The first therefore also indeed had ordinances of service, and the sanctuary, a worldly one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For a tabernacle was set up; the first, in which [were] both the candlestick and the table and the exposition of the loaves, which is called Holy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>but after the second veil a tabernacle which is called Holy of holies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, covered round in every part with gold, in which [were] the golden pot that had the manna, and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted, and the tables of the covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>and above over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy-seat; concerning which it is not now [the time] to speak in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests enter at all times, accomplishing the services;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>but into the second, the high priest only, once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>the Holy Spirit shewing this, that the way of the [holy of] holies has not yet been made manifest while as yet the first tabernacle has [its] standing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>the which [is] an image for the present time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices, unable to perfect as to conscience him that worshipped, are offered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>[consisting] only of meats and drinks and divers washings, ordinances of flesh, imposed until [the] time of setting things right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But Christ being come high priest of the good things to come, by the better and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, (that is, not of this creation,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>nor by blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, has entered in once for all into the [holy of] holies, having found an eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of goats and bulls, and a heifer's ashes sprinkling the defiled, sanctifies for the purity of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works to worship [the] living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And for this reason he is mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>(For where [there is] a testament, the death of the testator must needs come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For a testament [is] of force when men are dead, since it is in no way of force while the testator is alive.)</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For every commandment having been spoken according to [the] law by Moses to all the people; having taken the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying, This [is] the blood of the covenant which God has enjoined to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>And the tabernacle too and all the vessels of service he sprinkled in like manner with blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>and almost all things are purified with blood according to the law, and without blood-shedding there is no remission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>[It was] necessary then that the figurative representations of the things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices better than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For the Christ is not entered into holy places made with hand, figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>nor in order that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with blood not his own;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>since he had [then] been obliged often to suffer from the foundation of the world. But now once in the consummation of the ages he has been manifested for [the] putting away of sin by his sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And forasmuch as it is the portion of men once to die, and after this judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>thus the Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear to those that look for him the second time without sin for salvation.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For the law, having a shadow of the coming good things, not the image itself of the things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually yearly, perfect those who approach.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But in these [there is] a calling to mind of sins yearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For blood of bulls and goats [is] incapable of taking away sins.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>Thou tookest no pleasure in burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then I said, Lo, I come (in [the] roll of the book it is written of me) to do, O God, thy will.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And every priest stands daily ministering, and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But *he*, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down in perpetuity at [the] right hand of God,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>And the Holy Spirit also bears us witness [of it]; for after what was said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>This [is] the covenant which I will establish towards them after those days, saith [the] Lord: Giving my laws into their hearts, I will write them also in their understandings;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom [is] with some; but encouraging [one another], and by so much the more as ye see the day drawing near.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>on the one hand, when ye were made a spectacle both in reproaches and afflictions; and on the other, when ye became partakers with those who were passing through them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For ye both sympathised with prisoners and accepted with joy the plunder of your goods, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better substance, and an abiding one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>For ye have need of endurance in order that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>For yet a very little while he that comes will come, and will not delay.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.7'>Remember your leaders who have spoken to you the word of God; and considering the issue of their conversation, imitate their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.8'>Jesus Christ [is] the same yesterday, and to-day, and to the ages [to come].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.9'>Be not carried away with various and strange doctrines; for [it is] good that the heart be confirmed with grace, not meats; those who have walked in which have not been profited by [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.10'>We have an altar of which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.11'>for of those beasts whose blood is carried [as sacrifices for sin] into the [holy of] holies by the high priest, of these the bodies are burned outside the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.12'>Wherefore also Jesus, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.13'>therefore let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.14'>for we have not here an abiding city, but we seek the coming one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.15'>By him therefore let us offer [the] sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, [the] fruit of [the] lips confessing his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.16'>But of doing good and communicating [of your substance] be not forgetful, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.17'>Obey your leaders, and be submissive; for *they* watch over your souls as those that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not groaning, for this [would be] unprofitable for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.18'>Pray for us: for we persuade ourselves that we have a good conscience, in all things desirous to walk rightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.19'>But I much more beseech [you] to do this, that I may the more quickly be restored to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.20'>But the God of peace, who brought again from among [the] dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, in [the power of the] blood of [the] eternal covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.21'>perfect you in every good work to the doing of his will, doing in you what is pleasing before him through Jesus Christ; to whom [be] glory for the ages of ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.22'>But I beseech you, brethren, bear the word of exhortation, for it is but in few words that I have written to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.23'>Know that our brother Timotheus is set at liberty; with whom, if he should come soon, I will see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.24'>Salute all your leaders, and all the saints. They from Italy salute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.25'>Grace [be] with you all. Amen.</verse>
