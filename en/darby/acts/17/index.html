And some said, What would this chatterer say? and some, He seems to be an announcer of foreign demons, because he announced the glad tidings of Jesus and the resurrection [to them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And having taken hold on him they brought [him] to Areopagus, saying, Might we know what this new doctrine which is spoken by thee [is]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears. We wish therefore to know what these things may mean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now all [the] Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else than to tell and to hear the news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Paul standing in the midst of Areopagus said, Athenians, in every way I see you given up to demon worship;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for, passing through and beholding your shrines, I found also an altar on which was inscribed, To the unknown God. Whom therefore ye reverence, not knowing [him], him I announce to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The God who has made the world and all things which are in it, *he*, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>nor is served by men's hands as needing something, himself giving to all life and breath and all things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and has made of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, having determined ordained times and the boundaries of their dwelling,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that they may seek God; if indeed they might feel after him and find him, although he is not far from each one of us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for in him we live and move and exist; as also some of the poets amongst you have said, For we are also his offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Being therefore [the] offspring of God, we ought not to think that which is divine to be like gold or silver or stone, [the] graven form of man's art and imagination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>God therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, now enjoins men that they shall all everywhere repent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>because he has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by [the] man whom he has appointed, giving the proof [of it] to all [in] having raised him from among [the] dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they heard [of the] resurrection of the dead, some mocked, and some said, We will hear thee again also concerning this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus Paul went out of their midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But some men joining themselves to him believed; among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman by name Damaris, and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
