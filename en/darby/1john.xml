      <chapter osisID='1John.1'>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.1'>That which was from [the] beginning, that which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.2'>(and the life has been manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and has been manifested to us:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.3'>that which we have seen and heard we report to you, that *ye* also may have fellowship with us; and our fellowship [is] indeed with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.4'>And these things write we to you that your joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.5'>And this is the message which we have heard from him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.6'>If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not practise the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.7'>But if we walk in the light as *he* is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.8'>If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.9'>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us [our] sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.10'>If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.2'>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>My children, these things I write to you in order that ye may not sin; and if any one sin, we have a patron with the Father, Jesus Christ [the] righteous;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'>and *he* is the propitiation for our sins; but not for ours alone, but also for the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'>And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'>He that says, I know him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.5'>but whoever keeps his word, in him verily the love of God is perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.6'>He that says he abides in him ought, even as *he* walked, himself also [so] to walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'>Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'>Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light already shines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'>He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in the darkness until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'>He that loves his brother abides in light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'>But he that hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and knows not where he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.12'>I write to you, children, because [your] sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'>I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked [one]. I write to you, little children, because ye have known the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'>I have written to you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked [one].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'>because all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'>And the world is passing, and its lust, but he that does the will of God abides for eternity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'>Little children, it is [the] last hour, and, according as ye have heard that antichrist comes, even now there have come many antichrists, whence we know that it is [the] last hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>They went out from among us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have surely remained with us, but that they might be made manifest that none are of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.20'>And *ye* have [the] unction from the holy [one], and ye know all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.21'>I have not written to you because ye do not know the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.22'>Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? *He* is the antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'>Whoever denies the Son has not the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'>As for *you* let that which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you: if what ye have heard from the beginning abides in you, *ye* also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.25'>And this is the promise which *he* has promised us, life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'>These things have I written to you concerning those who lead you astray:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'>and *yourselves*, the unction which ye have received from him abides in you, and ye have not need that any one should teach you; but as the same unction teaches you as to all things, and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, ye shall abide in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.28'>And now, children, abide in him, that if he be manifested we may have boldness, and not be put to shame from before him at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.29'>If ye know that he is righteous, know that every one who practises righteousness is begotten of him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.3'>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.1'>See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called [the] children of God. For this reason the world knows us not, because it knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.2'>Beloved, now are we children of God, and what we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'>And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as *he* is pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'>Every one that practises sin practises also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'>And ye know that *he* has been manifested that he might take away our sins; and in him sin is not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'>Whoever abides in him, does not sin: whoever sins, has not seen him or known him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.7'>Children, let no man lead you astray; he that practises righteousness is righteous, even as *he* is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>He that practises sin is of the devil; for from [the] beginning the devil sins. To this end the Son of God has been manifested, that he might undo the works of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>Whoever has been begotten of God does not practise sin, because his seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>In this are manifest the children of God and the children of the devil. Whoever does not practise righteousness is not of God, and he who does not love his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'>For this is the message which ye have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'>not as Cain was of the wicked one, and slew his brother; and on account of what slew he him? because his works were wicked, and those of his brother righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.13'>Do not wonder, brethren, if the world hate you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'>*We* know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love [his] brother abides in death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.15'>Every one that hates his brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'>Hereby we have known love, because *he* has laid down his life for us; and *we* ought for the brethren to lay down [our] lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'>But whoso may have the world's substance, and see his brother having need, and shut up his bowels from him, how abides the love of God in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'>Children, let us not love with word, nor with tongue, but in deed and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'>And hereby we shall know that we are of the truth, and shall persuade our hearts before him</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'>that if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness towards God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'>and whatsoever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments, and practise the things which are pleasing in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.23'>And this is his commandment, that we believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and that we love one another, even as he has given us commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.24'>And he that keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given to us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.4'>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.1'>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, if they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.2'>Hereby ye know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ come in flesh is of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.3'>and every spirit which does not confess Jesus Christ come in flesh is not of God: and this is that [power] of the antichrist, [of] which ye have heard that it comes, and now it is already in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.4'>*Ye* are of God, children, and have overcome them, because greater is he that [is] in you than he that [is] in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.5'>*They* are of the world; for this reason they speak [as] of the world, and the world hears them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.6'>*We* are of God; he that knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.7'>Beloved, let us love one another; because love is of God, and every one that loves has been begotten of God, and knows God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.8'>He that loves not has not known God; for God is love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.9'>Herein as to us has been manifested the love of God, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.10'>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.11'>Beloved, if God has so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.12'>No one has seen God at any time: if we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.13'>Hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, that he has given to us of his Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.14'>And *we* have seen, and testify, that the Father has sent the Son [as] Saviour of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.15'>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.16'>And *we* have known and have believed the love which God has to us. God is love, and he that abides in love abides in God, and God in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.17'>Herein has love been perfected with us that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, that even as *he* is, *we* also are in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.18'>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; for fear has torment, and he that fears has not been made perfect in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.19'>*We* love because *he* has first loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.20'>If any one say, I love God, and hate his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.21'>And this commandment have we from him, That he that loves God love also his brother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.5'>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.1'>Every one that believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God; and every one that loves him that has begotten loves also him that is begotten of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.2'>Hereby know we that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.3'>For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.4'>For all that has been begotten of God gets the victory over the world; and this is the victory which has gotten the victory over the world, our faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.5'>Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.6'>This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus [the] Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, for the Spirit is the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.7'>For they that bear witness are three:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.8'>the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the three agree in one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.9'>If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. For this is the witness of God [which] he has witnessed concerning his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.10'>He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself; he that does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the witness which God has witnessed concerning his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.11'>And this is the witness, that God has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.12'>He that has the Son has life: he that has not the Son of God has not life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.13'>These things have I written to you that ye may know that ye have eternal life who believe on the name of the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.14'>And this is the boldness which we have towards him, that if we ask him anything according to his will he hears us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.15'>And if we know that he hears us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.16'>If any one see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life, for those that do not sin unto death. There is a sin to death: I do not say of that that he should make a request.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.17'>Every unrighteousness is sin; and there is a sin not to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.18'>We know that every one begotten of God does not sin, but he that has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the wicked [one] does not touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.19'>We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the wicked [one].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.20'>And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that [is] true; and we are in him that [is] true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.21'>Children, keep yourselves from idols.</verse>
