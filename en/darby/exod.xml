      <chapter osisID='Exod.1'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.1'>And these are the names of the sons of Israel who had come into Egypt; with Jacob had they come, each with his household:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.2'>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.3'>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.4'>Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.5'>And all the souls that had come out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls; and Joseph was in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.6'>And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.7'>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and swarmed and multiplied, and became exceeding strong; and the land was full of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.8'>And there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.9'>And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more numerous and stronger than we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.10'>Come on, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass that, if war occur, they take side with our enemies and fight against us, and go up out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.11'>And they set over them service-masters to oppress them with their burdens. And they built store-cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Rameses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.12'>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and spread; and they were distressed because of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.13'>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with harshness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.14'>and they embittered their life with hard labour in clay and bricks, and in all manner of labour in the field: all their labour with which they made them serve was with harshness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.15'>And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other was Puah</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.16'>and he said, When ye help the Hebrew women in bearing, and see [them] on the stool, if it be a son, then ye shall kill him, but if a daughter, then she shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.17'>But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt had said to them, but saved the male children alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.18'>And the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them, Why have ye done this, and saved the male children alive?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.19'>And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian; for they are strong, and they have borne before the midwife comes to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.20'>And God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and became very strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.21'>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.22'>Then Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, but every daughter ye shall save alive.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.2'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.1'>And a man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.2'>And the woman conceived, and bore a son. And she saw him that he was fair, and hid him three months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.3'>And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of reeds, and plastered it with resin and with pitch, and put the child in it, and laid [it] in the sedge on the bank of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.4'>And his sister stood afar off to see what would happen to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.5'>And the daughter of Pharaoh went down to bathe in the river; and her maids went along by the river's side. And she saw the ark in the midst of the sedge, and sent her handmaid and fetched it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.6'>And she opened [it], and saw the child, and behold, the boy wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is [one] of the Hebrews' children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.7'>And his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call thee a wet-nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.8'>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the damsel went and called the child's mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.9'>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give [thee] thy wages. And the woman took the child and nursed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.10'>And when the child was grown, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.11'>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren and looked on their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.12'>And he turned this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.13'>And he went out on the second day, and behold, two Hebrew men were quarrelling; and he said to him that was in the wrong, Why art thou smiting thy neighbour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.14'>And he said, Who made thee ruler and judge over us? dost thou intend to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? Then Moses feared, and said, Surely the matter is known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.15'>And Pharaoh heard of this matter, and sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from before Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian. And he sat by the well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.16'>And the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew [water], and filled the troughs, to water their father's flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.17'>And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses rose and helped them, and watered their flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.18'>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, Why are ye come so soon to-day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.19'>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew [water] abundantly for us, and watered the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.20'>And he said to his daughters, And where is he? why then have ye left the man behind? Call him, that he may eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.21'>And Moses consented to remain with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.22'>And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.23'>And it came to pass during those many days, that the king of Egypt died. And the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and cried; and their cry came up to God because of the bondage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.24'>and God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.25'>and God looked upon the children of Israel, and God acknowledged [them].</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.3'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.1'>And Moses tended the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock behind the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God to Horeb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.2'>And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a thorn-bush: and he looked, and behold, the thorn-bush burned with fire, and the thorn-bush was not being consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.3'>And Moses said, Let me now turn aside and see this great sight, why the thorn-bush is not burnt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.4'>And Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, and God called to him out of the midst of the thorn-bush and said, Moses, Moses! And he said, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.5'>And he said, Draw not nigh hither: loose thy sandals from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.6'>And he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.7'>And Jehovah said, I have seen assuredly the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and their cry have I heard on account of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.8'>And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good and spacious land, unto a land flowing with milk and honey, unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.9'>And now behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me; and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.10'>And now come, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.11'>And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.12'>And he said, For I will be with thee; and this shall be the sign to thee that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.13'>And Moses said to God, Behold, [when] I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.14'>And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM. And he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: I AM hath sent me unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.15'>And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you. This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.16'>Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying, I have indeed visited you, and [seen] that which is done unto you in Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.17'>and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt, unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.18'>And they shall hearken to thy voice. And thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath met with us; and now, let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.19'>But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a powerful hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.20'>And I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof; and after that he will let you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.21'>And I will give this people favour in the eyes of the Egyptians, and it shall come to pass, when ye go out, that ye shall not go out empty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.22'>but every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that is the inmate of her house, utensils of silver, and utensils of gold, and clothing; and ye shall put [them] on your sons and on your daughters, and shall spoil the Egyptians.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.4'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.1'>And Moses answered and said, But behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, Jehovah has not appeared to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.2'>And Jehovah said to him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.3'>And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.4'>And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand and take it by the tail and he stretched out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.5'>that they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.6'>And Jehovah said moreover to him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom, and took it out, and behold, his hand was leprous, as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.7'>And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again, and took it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.8'>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the other sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.9'>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also those two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour [it] on the dry [land]; and the water that thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry [land].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.10'>And Moses said to Jehovah, Ah Lord! I am not eloquent, neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken to thy servant, for I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.11'>And Jehovah said to him, Who gave man a mouth? or who maketh dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? [have] not I, Jehovah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.12'>And now go, and I will be with thy mouth, and will teach thee what thou shalt say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.13'>And he said, Ah Lord! send, I pray thee, by the hand [of him whom] thou wilt send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.14'>Then the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also behold, he goeth out to meet thee; and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.15'>And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.16'>And he shall speak for thee unto the people; and it shall come to pass that he shall be to thee for a mouth, and thou shalt be to him for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.17'>And thou shalt take this staff in thy hand, with which thou shalt do the signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.18'>And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return to my brethren who are in Egypt, that I may see whether they are yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.19'>And Jehovah said to Moses in Midian, Go, return to Egypt; for all the men are dead who sought thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.20'>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them riding upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.21'>And Jehovah said to Moses, When thou goest to return to Egypt, see that thou do all the wonders before Pharaoh that I have put in thy hand. And I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.22'>And thou shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah: Israel is my son, my firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.23'>And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me. And if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill thy son, thy firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.24'>And it came to pass on the way, in the inn, that Jehovah came upon him, and sought to slay him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.25'>Then Zipporah took a stone and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, A bloody husband indeed art thou to me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.26'>And he let him go. Then she said, A bloody husband because of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.27'>And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him on the mountain of God, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.28'>And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah who had sent him, and all the signs that he had commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.29'>And Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the children of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.30'>and Aaron spoke all the words that Jehovah had spoken to Moses, and did the signs before the eyes of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.31'>And the people believed. And when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.5'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.1'>And afterwards Moses and Aaron went in, and said to Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Let my people go that they may celebrate a feast to me in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.2'>And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, to whose voice I am to hearken to let Israel go? I do not know Jehovah, neither will I let Israel go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.3'>And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.4'>And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, wish to have the people go off from their works? Away, to your burdens!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.5'>And Pharaoh said, Behold the people of the land are now many, and ye wish to make them rest from their burdens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.6'>And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.7'>Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.8'>And the number of the bricks they have made heretofore shall ye lay upon them: ye shall not diminish any of it, for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go [and] sacrifice to our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.9'>Let them put heavier labour on the men, that they may be taken up with it, and not regard vain words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.10'>And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out and spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh: I will not give you straw:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.11'>go ye, get yourselves straw where ye may find it; but none of your work shall be diminished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.12'>And the people were scattered abroad throughout the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.13'>And the taskmasters urged [them], saying, Fulfil your labours, the daily work, as when there was straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.14'>And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, [and] it was said, Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick, both yesterday and to-day, as heretofore?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.15'>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why dost thou deal thus with thy bondmen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.16'>There is no straw given to thy bondmen, and they say to us, Make brick; and behold, thy bondmen are beaten, but it is the fault of thy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.17'>And he said, Ye are idle, idle! therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.18'>And now go work! and straw shall not be given you, and ye shall deliver the measure of bricks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.19'>And the officers of the children of Israel saw [that] it stood ill with them, because it was said, Ye shall not diminish anything from your bricks, the daily work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.20'>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood there to meet them, as they came out from Pharaoh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.16.13'>And it came to pass in the evening, that quails came up, and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay round the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.14'>And when the dew that lay [round it] was gone up, behold, on the face of the wilderness there was [something] fine, granular, fine as hoar-frost, on the ground.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.16.17'>And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some much, some little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.18'>And they measured with the omer: then he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little wanted nothing: they had gathered every man according to the measure of his eating.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.16.30'>And the people rested on the seventh day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.31'>And the house of Israel called its name Manna; and it was like coriander-seed, white; and the taste of it was like cake with honey.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.16.33'>And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put in it an omer full of manna, and deposit it before Jehovah, to be kept for your generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.34'>As Jehovah had commanded Moses, so Aaron deposited it before the Testimony, to be kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.16.35'>And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came into an inhabited land: they ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.</verse>
