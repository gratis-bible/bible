      <chapter osisID='Judg.1'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.1'>And it came to pass after the death of Joshua that the children of Israel asked Jehovah, saying, Which of us shall go up against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.2'>And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.3'>And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, and let us fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot; and Simeon went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.4'>And Judah went up; and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they smote them in Bezek, ten thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.5'>And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.6'>And Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.7'>And Adoni-Bezek said, Seventy kings, with their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gleaned under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.8'>And the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.9'>And afterwards the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the hill-country, and in the south, and in the lowland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.10'>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-Arba; and they slew Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.11'>And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir; now the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.12'>And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjath-sepher and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.13'>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.14'>And it came to pass as she came, that she urged him to ask of her father the field; and she sprang down from the ass. And Caleb said to her, What wouldest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.15'>And she said to him, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a southern land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.16'>And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, had gone up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.17'>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it; and they called the name of the city Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.18'>And Judah took Gazah and its border, and Ashkelon and its border, and Ekron and its border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.19'>And Jehovah was with Judah; and he took possession of the hill-country, for he did not dispossess the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.20'>And they gave to Caleb Hebron, as Moses had said; and he dispossessed from thence the three sons of Anak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.21'>And the children of Benjamin did not dispossess the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.22'>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel; and Jehovah was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.23'>And the house of Joseph sent to search out Bethel; now the name of the city before was Luz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.24'>And the guards saw a man come forth out of the city, and said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, how [we] may enter into the city, and we will shew thee kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.25'>And he shewed them how to enter into the city. And they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.26'>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.27'>And Manasseh did not dispossess Beth-shean and its dependent villages, nor Taanach and its dependent villages, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its dependent villages, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its dependent villages, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its dependent villages; and the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.28'>And it came to pass when Israel became strong, that they made the Canaanites tributary; but they did not utterly dispossess them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.29'>And Ephraim did not dispossess the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt among them in Gezer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.30'>Zebulun did not dispossess the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.31'>Asher did not dispossess the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor Ahlab, nor Achzib, nor Helbah, nor Aphik, nor Rehob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.32'>and the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not dispossess them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.33'>Naphtali did not dispossess the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; and he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, but the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.34'>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country, for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.35'>And the Amorites would dwell on mount Heres, in Ajalon and in Shaalbim; but the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, and they became tributaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.36'>And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upwards.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.2'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.1'>And the Angel of Jehovah came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you; and as for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.2'>ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not hearkened unto my voice. Why have ye done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.3'>Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be [scourges] in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.4'>And it came to pass, when the Angel of Jehovah spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.5'>And they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.6'>And Joshua dismissed the people, and the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.7'>And the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua, who had seen all the great works of Jehovah, which he had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.8'>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, a hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.9'>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-Heres, in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the mountain of Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.10'>And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers; and there arose another generation after them, which knew not Jehovah, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.11'>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.12'>And they forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked Jehovah to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.13'>And they forsook Jehovah, and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.14'>And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about; and they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.15'>Whithersoever they went out the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had said, and as Jehovah had sworn unto them; and they were greatly distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.16'>And Jehovah raised up judges, and they saved them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.17'>But they did not even hearken to their judges, for they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves to them; they turned quickly out of the way that their fathers had walked in, obeying the commandments of Jehovah; they did not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.18'>And when Jehovah raised them up judges, then Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it repented Jehovah because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and crushed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.19'>And it came to pass when the judge died, that they turned back and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them: they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.20'>And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel; and he said, Because this nation hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and hath not hearkened unto my voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.21'>I also will not henceforth dispossess from before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.22'>that through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of Jehovah to walk therein, as their fathers did keep [it], or not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.23'>Therefore Jehovah left those nations, without dispossessing them hastily, neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.3'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.1'>And these are the nations that Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, all that had not known all the wars of Canaan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.2'>only that the generations of the children of Israel might know war by learning it, at the least those who before had known nothing thereof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.3'>five lord ships of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwell on mount Lebanon; from mount Baal-Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.4'>And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commandments of Jehovah, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.5'>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites: Hittites and Amorites and Perizzites and Hivites and Jebusites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.6'>and they took their daughters as wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.7'>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and forgot Jehovah their God, and served the Baals and the Asherahs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.8'>And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.9'>And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah; and Jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.10'>And the Spirit of Jehovah was upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Jehovah gave Chushan-rishathaim king of Syria into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.11'>And the land had rest forty years; and Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.12'>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they did evil in the sight of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.13'>And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek and went and smote Israel, and they took possession of the city of palm-trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.14'>And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.15'>And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah, and Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a man left-handed. And by him the children of Israel sent a gift to Eglon king of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.16'>And Ehud made him a sword having two edges, it was of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right hip.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.17'>And he brought the gift to Eglon king of Moab; now Eglon was a very fat man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.18'>And it came to pass when he had ended offering the gift, he sent away the people that had borne the gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.19'>But he turned from the graven images that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret word unto thee, O king. And he said, Be silent! And all that stood by him went out from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.20'>And Ehud came to him; now he was sitting in the cool upper-chamber, which was for him alone. And Ehud said, I have a word from God unto thee. And he arose from the seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.21'>Then Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right hip, and thrust it into his belly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.22'>and the haft also went in after the blade, and the fat closed upon the blade; for he did not draw the sword out of his belly, and it came out between the legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.23'>And Ehud went out into the portico, and shut the doors of the upper-chamber upon him, and bolted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.24'>And when he was gone out, the servants of the [king] came and saw, and behold, the doors of the upper-chamber were bolted. And they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the summer chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.25'>And they waited till they were ashamed; and behold, he opened not the doors of the upper-chamber, and they took the key, and opened [them], and behold, their lord lay dead on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.26'>And Ehud had escaped while they lingered, and passed beyond the graven images, and escaped to Seirah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.27'>And it came to pass when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.28'>And he said to them, Follow after me, for Jehovah has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan toward Moab, and suffered no one to pass over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.29'>And they slew the Moabites at that time, about ten thousand men, all fat, and all men of valour, and not a man escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.30'>And Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.31'>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath; and he smote the Philistines, six hundred men, with an ox-goad. And he also delivered Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.4'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.1'>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of Jehovah; now Ehud was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.2'>And Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; and the captain of his army was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth-Goim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.3'>And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and he mightily oppressed the children of Israel twenty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.4'>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, judged Israel at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.5'>And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.6'>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-Naphtali, and said to him, Hath not Jehovah the God of Israel commanded? Go and draw towards mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.7'>and I will draw unto thee, to the torrent Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, and his chariots and his multitude, and I will give him into thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.8'>And Barak said to her, If thou goest with me, then I will go, but if thou goest not with me, I will not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.9'>And she said, I will by all means go with thee, only that it will not be to thine honour upon the way which thou goest, for Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.10'>And Barak called together Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and there went up at his feet ten thousand men; and Deborah went up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.11'>(Now Heber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites, from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak of Zaannaim, which is by Kedesh.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.12'>And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to mount Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.13'>Then Sisera gathered together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth-Goim to the torrent Kishon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.14'>And Deborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which Jehovah hath given Sisera into thy hand! Is not Jehovah gone out before thee? And Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.15'>And Jehovah discomfited Sisera, and all the chariots, and all the army, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera got down from [his] chariot, and fled on foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.16'>And Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army, to Harosheth-Goim; and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not one was left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.17'>And Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.18'>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And he turned in to her, into the tent, and she covered him with the quilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.19'>And he said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty. And she opened the flask of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.20'>And he said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be if any one come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.21'>And Jael Heber's wife took a tent-pin, and took the hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it penetrated into the ground; for he had fallen into a deep sleep and was faint; and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.22'>And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael went out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And he went into her [tent], and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the pin was in his temples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.23'>So God subdued on that day Jabin king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.24'>And the hand of the children of Israel ever advanced, and prevailed against Jabin king of Canaan, until they had cut off Jabin king of Canaan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.5'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.1'>Then sang Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoam, on that day, saying,</verse>
