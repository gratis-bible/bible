      <chapter osisID='1Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>And there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of Jehovah, were there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>And it came to pass on the day that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>but to Hannah he used to give a double portion, for he loved Hannah; but Jehovah had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>And her adversary provoked her much also, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>And [as] he did so year by year, as often as she went up to the house of Jehovah, she provoked her thus; and she wept and did not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? Am not I better to thee than ten sons?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>And Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk; (now Eli the priest sat upon the seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>and she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Jehovah, and wept much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man child, then I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>And it came to pass as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; and Eli thought she was drunken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>Take not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my grief and provocation have I spoken hitherto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>And Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition which thou hast asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>And she said, Let thy bondwoman find grace in thy sight. And the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more [as before].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>And they rose up early in the morning and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>And it came to pass when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel, [saying,] Because I have asked him of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>And Elkanah her husband, and all his house, went up to sacrifice to Jehovah the yearly sacrifice and his vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, [I will wait] until the child is weaned; then will I bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what is good in thy sight: abide until thou hast weaned him; only, may Jehovah fulfil his word. And the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>And she took him up with her when she had weaned him, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a flask of wine, and brought him to the house of Jehovah to Shiloh; and the boy was young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>And they slaughtered the bullock, and brought the boy to Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>And she said, Oh my lord, [as] thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here to pray to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>For this boy I prayed; and Jehovah has granted me my petition which I asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>And also I have lent him to Jehovah: all the days that he lives, he is lent to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart exulteth in Jehovah, my horn is lifted up in Jehovah; my mouth is opened wide over mine enemies; for I rejoice in thy salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>There is none holy as Jehovah, for there is none beside thee, neither is there any rock like our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>Do not multiply your words of pride, let not vain-glory come out of your mouth; For Jehovah is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>The bow of the mighty is broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>They that were full have hired themselves out for bread; and the hungry are [so] no more: Even the barren beareth seven, and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich, he bringeth low, also he lifteth up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>He raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy, To set [him] among nobles; and he maketh them inherit a throne of glory; For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, and he hath set the world upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>He keepeth the feet of his saints, but the wicked are silenced in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces; in the heavens will he thunder upon them. Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; and he will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the boy ministered to Jehovah in the presence of Eli the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>And the priests' custom with the people was, when any man sacrificed a sacrifice, the priest's servant came, when the flesh was cooked, with a flesh-hook of three prongs in his hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot; the priest took of it all that the flesh-hook brought up. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>Even before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, and he will not accept sodden flesh of thee, but raw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>If the man said to him, They will immediately burn the fat entire, then take as thy soul desires; he would say [to him], No, but thou shalt give [it] now; and if not, I will take [it] by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah, for men despised the offering of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>And Samuel ministered before Jehovah, a boy girded with a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>And his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to sacrifice the yearly sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to Jehovah. And they went to their own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>So Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>And Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and that they lay with the women that served at the entrance of the tent of meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>And he said to them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil deeds from all this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>No, my sons, for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovah's people transgress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>If one man sin against another, God will judge him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall intreat for him? But they hearkened not to the voice of their father, for Jehovah was minded to slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>And the boy Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with Jehovah and also with men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Did I plainly reveal myself to the house of thy father when they were in Egypt, in Pharaoh's house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>and choose him out of all the tribes of Israel, to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear the ephod before me? and I gave unto the house of thy father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>Wherefore do ye trample upon my sacrifice and upon mine oblation which I have commanded [in my] habitation? And thou honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the primest of all the oblations of Israel my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>Wherefore Jehovah the God of Israel saith, I said indeed, Thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever. But now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Behold, days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>And thou shalt see an oppressor [in my] habitation, amidst all the good that shall be done to Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>And the man of thine [whom] I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to cause thine eyes to fail and to grieve thy soul; and all the increase of thy house shall die in their vigour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>And this shall be the sign to thee, which shall come upon thy two sons, upon Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die, both of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, [who] shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>And it shall come to pass [that] every one that is left of thy house shall come to crouch to him for a small piece of silver and for a cake of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priestly offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>And the boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was rare in those days; a vision was not frequent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.2'>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli lay in his place (now his eyes began to grow dim, he could not see),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.3'>and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel lay in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.4'>that Jehovah called to Samuel. And he said, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.5'>And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I did not call: lie down again. And he went and lay down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.6'>And Jehovah called again, Samuel! And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I did not call, my son: lie down again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.7'>Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither had the word of Jehovah yet been revealed to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.8'>And Jehovah called again the third time, Samuel! And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah was calling the boy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.9'>And Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah, for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.10'>And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at the other times, Samuel, Samuel! And Samuel said, Speak, for thy servant heareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.11'>And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.12'>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house; I will begin and make an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.13'>For I have declared to him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he hath known: because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.14'>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice or oblation for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.15'>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to declare the vision to Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.16'>And Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.17'>And he said, What is the word that he has spoken to thee? I pray thee, keep it not back from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou keep back anything from me of all the word that he spoke to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.18'>And Samuel told him all the words, and kept nothing back from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what is good in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.19'>And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.20'>And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.21'>And Jehovah appeared again at Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.1'>And what Samuel had said happened to all Israel. And Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.2'>And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel; and the battle spread, and Israel was routed before the Philistines; and they slew in battle array in the field about four thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.3'>And the people came into the camp; and the elders of Israel said, Why has Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch ourselves the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.4'>So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sitteth between the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there by the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.5'>And it came to pass when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, that all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth shook.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.6'>And the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, and said, What is the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of Jehovah had come into the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.7'>And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there has not been such a thing heretofore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.8'>Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.9'>Shew yourselves valiant and be men, ye Philistines, that ye may not have to be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been servants to you: be men, and fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.10'>And the Philistines fought, and Israel was routed, and they fled every man to his tent; and there was a very great slaughter, and there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.11'>And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.12'>And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the battle, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.13'>And when he came, behold, Eli was sitting upon the seat by the way-side watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And the man came to tell it in the city, and all the city cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.14'>And Eli heard the noise of the crying, and said, What is the noise of this tumult? And the man came hastily, and told Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.15'>Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set, that he could not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.16'>And the man said to Eli, I am he that came out of the battle, and I have fled to-day out of the battle. And he said, What has taken place, my son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.17'>And the messenger answered and said, Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.18'>And it came to pass, when he mentioned the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died; for the man was old, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.19'>And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered; and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.20'>And as she was dying, the women that stood by her said, Fear not; for thou hast borne a son. But she did not answer, neither did she take it to heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.21'>And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.22'>And she said, The glory is departed from Israel, for the ark of God is taken.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.1'>And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer to Ashdod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.2'>And the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.3'>And when they of Ashdod arose early the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.4'>And when they arose early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the fish-stump was left to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.5'>Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any that come into Dagon's house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.6'>And the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he laid them waste, and smote them with hemorrhoids, Ashdod and its borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.7'>And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for his hand is severe upon us, and upon Dagon our god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.8'>And they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.26'>And Samuel said to Saul, I will not turn again with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah has rejected thee from being king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.27'>And as Samuel turned to go away, [Saul] laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.28'>Then Samuel said to him, Jehovah has rent the kingdom of Israel from thee to-day, and has given it to thy neighbour, who is better than thou.</verse>

And Saul said, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets nor by dreams; therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known to me what I shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.16'>And Samuel said, Why then dost thou inquire of me, seeing Jehovah is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.17'>And Jehovah has done for himself as he spoke by me; and Jehovah has rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbour, to David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.18'>Because thou didst not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, and didst not execute his fierce anger upon Amalek, therefore has Jehovah done this thing to thee this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.19'>And Jehovah will also give Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me; the army of Israel also will Jehovah give into the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.20'>And Saul fell straightway his full length on the earth, and was sore afraid because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.21'>And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said to him, Behold, thy bondmaid has hearkened to thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened to thy words which thou spokest to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.22'>And now, I pray thee, hearken thou also to the voice of thy bondmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.23'>But he refused and said, I will not eat. Then his servants, and the woman also, compelled him, and he hearkened to their voice; and he arose from the earth and sat on the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.24'>And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread thereof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.25'>and she brought it near before Saul, and before his servants, and they ate. And they rose up and went away that night.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.7'>And now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.3'>And David and his men came to the city, and behold, it was burnt with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters were taken captives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.4'>Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.5'>And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jizreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.6'>And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him; for the soul of all the people was embittered, every man because of his sons and because of his daughters; but David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.7'>And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, Bring near to me, I pray thee, the ephod. And Abiathar brought the ephod near to David.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.13'>And David said to him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.14'>We made a raid against the south of the Cherethites, and against what [belongs] to Judah, and against the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.5'>And when his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on his sword, and died with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.6'>So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armour-bearer, and all his men, that same day together.</verse>
