  <div type='book' osisID='Dan'>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.1'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.1'>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.2'>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, and a part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar, to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.3'>And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz the chief of his eunuchs, that he should bring of the children of Israel, both of the royal seed and of the nobles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.4'>youths in whom was no blemish, and of goodly countenance, and skilful in all wisdom, and acquainted with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the language of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.5'>And the king appointed unto them a daily provision of the king's delicate food, and of the wine that he drank, to nourish them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.6'>Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.7'>And the prince of the eunuchs gave them names: to Daniel he gave [the name] Belteshazzar, and to Hananiah, Shadrach, and to Mishael, Meshach, and to Azariah, Abed-nego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.8'>And Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not pollute himself with the king's delicate food, nor with the wine which he drank; and he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not have to pollute himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.9'>And God granted Daniel favour and mercy before the prince of the eunuchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.10'>And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king who hath appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces worse liking than the youths who are of your age? and ye would endanger my head with the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.11'>And Daniel said to the steward, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.12'>Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.13'>then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king's delicate food: and as thou shalt see, deal with thy servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.14'>And he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.15'>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and were fatter in flesh than all the youths that ate of the king's delicate food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.16'>So the steward took away their delicate food, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.17'>As for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.18'>And at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.19'>And the king spoke with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: and they stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.20'>And in all matters of judicious wisdom, as to which the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the scribes [and] magicians that were in all his realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.21'>And Daniel continued unto the first year of king Cyrus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.2'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.1'>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.2'>And the king commanded to call the scribes, and the magicians, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to shew the king his dreams; and they came and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.3'>And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.4'>And the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, O king, live for ever! tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.5'>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The command is gone forth from me: If ye do not make known unto me the dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.6'>But if ye shew the dream and its interpretation, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour; therefore shew me the dream and its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.7'>They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.8'>The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye would gain time, because ye see the word is gone forth from me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.9'>but if ye do not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.10'>The Chaldeans answered before the king and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter; therefore there is no king, however great and powerful, that hath asked such a thing of any scribe, or magician, or Chaldean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.11'>For the thing that the king demandeth is extraordinary, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.12'>For this cause the king was irritated and very wroth, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.13'>And the decree went forth that the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.14'>Then Daniel answered with counsel and prudence to Arioch the chief of the king's bodyguard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.15'>he answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so rigorous from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.16'>And Daniel went in, and requested of the king that he would give him time, that he might shew the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.17'>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.18'>that they would desire mercies of the God of the heavens concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.19'>Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.20'>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; For wisdom and might are his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.21'>And it is he that changeth times and seasons; He deposeth kings, and setteth up kings; He giveth wisdom to the wise, And knowledge to them that know understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.22'>It is he that revealeth the deep and secret things; He knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.23'>I thank thee, and I praise thee, O God of my fathers, Who hast given me wisdom and might, And hast made known unto me already what we desired of thee; For thou hast made known unto us the king's matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.24'>Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.25'>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him: I have found a man of the sons of the captivity of Judah that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.26'>The king answered and said unto Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream that I have seen, and its interpretation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.27'>Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said, The secret that the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the magicians, the scribes, the astrologers, shew unto the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.28'>but there is a God in the heavens, who revealeth secrets, and maketh known to king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be at the end of days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.29'>as for thee, O king, thy thoughts arose upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.30'>And as for me, this secret is revealed to me, not by [any] wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation should be made known to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.31'>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold, a great image. This image was mighty and its brightness excellent; it stood before thee, and its appearance was terrible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.32'>This image's head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.33'>its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.34'>Thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands; and it smote the image upon its feet of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.35'>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken in pieces together, and they became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, and no place was found for them. And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.36'>This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.37'>Thou, O king, art a king of kings, unto whom the God of the heavens hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.38'>and wheresoever the children of men, the beasts of the field, and the fowl of the heavens dwell, he hath given them into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all: thou art this head of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.39'>And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; then another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.40'>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth everything, and as iron that breaketh all these, so shall it break in pieces and bruise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.41'>And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.42'>And [as] the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay, the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.43'>And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.44'>And in the days of these kings shall the God of the heavens set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the sovereignty thereof shall not be left to another people: it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, but itself shall stand for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.45'>Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter. And the dream is certain, and the interpretation of it sure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.46'>Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.47'>The king answered Daniel and said, Of a truth it is that your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, because thou wast able to reveal this secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.48'>Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.49'>And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon. And Daniel was in the gate of the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.3'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits, [and] its breadth six cubits; he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.2'>And Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the justices, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.3'>Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the justices, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.4'>And the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, [O] peoples, nations, and languages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.5'>that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.6'>and whosoever doth not fall down and worship shall that same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.7'>Therefore at that time when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages fell down [and] worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.8'>Whereupon at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.9'>They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.10'>Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.11'>and [that] whosoever doth not fall down and worship, shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.12'>There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: these men, O king, regard thee not; they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image that thou hast set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.13'>Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then were these men brought before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.14'>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them, Is it of purpose, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden image that I have set up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.15'>Now if ye be ready at the time that ye hear the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, [well]: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast that same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace: and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.16'>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.17'>If it be [so], our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver [us] out of thy hand, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.18'>But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image that thou hast set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.19'>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. He spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.20'>And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.21'>Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their cloaks, and their garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.22'>Forasmuch as the king's commandment was rigorous, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that had taken up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.23'>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.24'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste; he spoke and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.25'>He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.26'>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the opening of the burning fiery furnace; he spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come [hither]. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth from the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.27'>And the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had had no power, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.28'>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and who changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.29'>Therefore I make a decree, that in every people, nation, and language, he who shall speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and his house shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that is able to deliver after this sort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.30'>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.4'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.2'>It hath seemed good unto me to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God hath wrought toward me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.3'>How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.4'>I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.5'>I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.6'>And I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.7'>Then came in the scribes, the magicians, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.8'>But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and before him I told the dream:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.9'>O Belteshazzar, master of the scribes, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret is too hard for thee, tell me the visions of my dream which I have seen, and the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.10'>Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.11'>The tree grew, and was strong, and its height reached unto the heavens, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.12'>Its leaves were beautiful, and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.13'>I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.14'>he cried aloud, and said thus: Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the beasts get away from under it, and the birds from its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.15'>Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be bathed with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.16'>Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.4.18'>This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and thou, Belteshazzar, tell the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.19'>Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, nor its interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and its interpretation to thine enemies!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.20'>The tree that thou sawest, which grew and was strong, whose height reached unto the heavens, and the sight of it to all the earth;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.4.22'>it is thou, O king, who art grown and become strong; for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto the heavens, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.23'>And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from the heavens, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be bathed with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.24'>this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which cometh upon my lord the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.25'>They shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and thou shalt be bathed with the dew of heaven; and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.26'>And whereas it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom shall remain unto thee, after that thou shalt know that the heavens do rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.27'>Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.28'>All this came upon king Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.29'>At the end of twelve months he was walking upon the royal palace of Babylon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.30'>the king spoke and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.31'>While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from the heavens: King Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.32'>and they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.33'>The same hour was the word fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen; and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven, till his hair grew like eagles' [feathers], and his nails like birds' [claws].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.34'>And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto the heavens, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.35'>And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he doeth according to his will in the army of the heavens, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.36'>At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my nobles sought me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.37'>Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of the heavens, all whose works are truth, and his paths judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.6.7'>All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects, and the satraps, the counsellors, and the governors have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.8'>Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.6.12'>Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's decree: Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask [anything] of any god or man within thirty days, except of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?

        <verse osisID='Dan.6.13'>Then they answered and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.6.20'>And when he came near unto the den, he cried with a mournful voice unto Daniel: the king spoke and said unto Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, hath thy God whom thou servest continually been able to save thee from the lions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.21'>Then Daniel spoke unto the king, O king, live for ever!</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.7'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.1'>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream; he told the sum of the matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.2'>Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of the heavens broke forth upon the great sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.3'>And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.4'>The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till its wings were plucked; and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.5'>And behold, another beast, a second, like unto a bear, and it raised up itself on one side; and [it had] three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and they said thus unto it: Arise, devour much flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.6'>After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird upon its back; and the beast had four heads; and dominion was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.7'>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and exceeding strong; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.8'>I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another, a little horn, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.9'>I beheld till thrones were set, and the Ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was flames of fire, [and] its wheels burning fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.10'>A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.11'>I beheld therefore, because of the voice of the great words that the horn spoke; I beheld till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given up to be burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.12'>As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away; but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.13'>I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of heaven [one] like a son of man, and he came up even to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.14'>And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.15'>As for me Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.16'>I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the certainty of all this. And he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.17'>These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, [that] shall arise out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.18'>But the saints of the most high [places] shall receive the kingdom, and they shall possess the kingdom for ever, even to the ages of ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.19'>Then I desired to know the certainty concerning the fourth beast, which was different from them all, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.20'>and concerning the ten horns that were in its head, and the other that came up, and before which three fell: even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and whose look was more imposing than its fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.21'>I beheld, and that horn made war with the saints, and prevailed over them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.22'>until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most high [places]; and the appointed time arrived, and the saints possessed the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.23'>He said thus: The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon the earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.24'>And as to the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall arise ten kings; and another shall arise after them; and he shall be different from the former, and he shall subdue three kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.25'>And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most high [places], and think to change seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and a half time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.26'>And the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.27'>But the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heavens, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high [places]. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.28'>So far is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.8'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.1'>In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king, a vision appeared unto me, [even] to me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.2'>And I saw in the vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was in the fortress of Shushan, which is in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.3'>And I lifted up mine eyes and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; and one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.4'>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward, and no beast could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; and he did according to his will, and became great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.5'>And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.6'>And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.7'>And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged with him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; and he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.8'>And the he-goat became exceeding great; but when he was become strong, the great horn was broken; and in its stead came up four notable ones toward the four winds of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.9'>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beauty [of the earth].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.10'>And it became great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down [some] of the host and of the stars to the ground, and trampled upon them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.9.1'>In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.2'>in the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by the books that the number of the years, whereof the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishment of the desolations of Jerusalem, was seventy years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.3'>And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.4'>and I prayed unto Jehovah my God, and made my confession, and said, Alas Lord! the great and terrible God, keeping covenant and loving-kindness with them that love him, and that keep his commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.5'>we have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from thy commandments and from thine ordinances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.6'>And we have not hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, who spoke in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.9.12'>And he hath performed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; so that there hath not been done under the whole heaven as hath been done upon Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.9.16'>Lord, according to all thy righteousnesses, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; for because of our sins, and because of the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people [are become] a reproach to all round about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.17'>And now, our God, hearken to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.9.25'>Know therefore and understand: From the going forth of the word to restore and to build Jerusalem unto Messiah, the Prince, are seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks. The street and the moat shall be built again, even in troublous times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.26'>And after the sixty-two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, and shall have nothing; and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with an overflow, and unto the end, war, the desolations determined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.27'>And he shall confirm a covenant with the many [for] one week; and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and because of the protection of abominations [there shall be] a desolator, even until that the consumption and what is determined shall be poured out upon the desolate.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.10'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.1'>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing is true, but the appointed time of trial is long; and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.2'>In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.10.4'>And on the four-and-twentieth day of the first month, I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.5'>and I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man clothed in linen, and his loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.6'>and his body was like a chrysolite, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as torches of fire, and his arms and his feet as the look of burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.7'>And I Daniel alone saw the vision; and the men that were with me saw not the vision, but a great quaking fell on them, and they fled to hide themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.8'>And I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; and my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.9'>And I heard the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, I fell into a deep stupor on my face, and my face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.10'>And behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and the palms of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.11'>And he said unto me, O Daniel, man greatly beloved, understand the words which I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for unto thee am I now sent. And as he spoke this word unto me, I stood trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.12'>And he said unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come because of thy words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.13'>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; and behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.10.19'>and he said, Fear not, man greatly beloved; peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And as he was speaking with me I was strengthened, and I said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.20'>And he said, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? And now I return to fight with the prince of Persia; and when I go forth, behold, the prince of Greece shall come.</verse>
