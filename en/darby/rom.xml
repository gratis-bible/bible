      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, bondman of Jesus Christ, [a] called apostle, separated to God's glad tidings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>(which he had before promised by his prophets in holy writings,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>concerning his Son (come of David's seed according to flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>marked out Son of God in power, according to [the] Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of [the] dead) Jesus Christ our Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>by whom we have received grace and apostleship in behalf of his name, for obedience of faith among all the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>among whom are *ye* also [the] called of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and [our] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed in the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the glad tidings of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>always beseeching at my prayers, if any way now at least I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I greatly desire to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to establish you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>that is, to have mutual comfort among you, each by the faith [which is] in the other, both yours and mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>But I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that I often proposed to come to you, (and have been hindered until the present time,) that I might have some fruit among you too, even as among the other nations also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I am a debtor both to Greeks and barbarians, both to wise and unintelligent:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>so, as far as depends on me, am I ready to announce the glad tidings to you also who [are] in Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the glad tidings; for it is God's power to salvation, to every one that believes, both to Jew first and to Greek:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>for righteousness of God is revealed therein, on the principle of faith, to faith: according as it is written, But the just shall live by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>For there is revealed wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety, and unrighteousness of men holding the truth in unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>Because what is known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested [it] to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>for from [the] world's creation the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity, so as to render them inexcusable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>Because, knowing God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but fell into folly in their thoughts, and their heart without understanding was darkened:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into [the] likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and quadrupeds and reptiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Wherefore God gave them up [also] in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies between themselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>who changed the truth of God into falsehood, and honoured and served the creature more than him who had created [it], who is blessed for ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>For this reason God gave them up to vile lusts; for both their females changed the natural use into that contrary to nature;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>and in like manner the males also, leaving the natural use of the female, were inflamed in their lust towards one another; males with males working shame, and receiving in themselves the recompense of their error which was fit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And according as they did not think good to have God in [their] knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind to practise unseemly things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil dispositions; whisperers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>back-biters, hateful to God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>void of understanding, faithless, without natural affection, unmerciful;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>who knowing the righteous judgment of God, that they who do such things are worthy of death, not only practise them, but have fellow delight in those who do [them].</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, every one who judgest, for in that in which thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who do such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>And thinkest thou this, O man, who judgest those that do such things, and practisest them [thyself], that *thou* shalt escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>but, according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up to thyself wrath, in [the] day of wrath and revelation of [the] righteous judgment of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>who shall render to each according to his works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>to them who, in patient continuance of good works, seek for glory and honour and incorruptibility, life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>But to those that are contentious, and are disobedient to the truth, but obey unrighteousness, [there shall be] wrath and indignation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>tribulation and distress, on every soul of man that works evil, both of Jew first, and of Greek;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>but glory and honour and peace to every one that works good, both to Jew first and to Greek:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>for there is no acceptance of persons with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>For as many as have sinned without law shall perish also without law; and as many as have sinned under law shall be judged by law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>(for not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>For when [those of the] nations, which have no law, practise by nature the things of the law, these, having no law, are a law to themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or else excusing themselves between themselves;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>in [the] day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my glad tidings, by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>But if *thou* art named a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>and knowest the will, and discerningly approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>and hast confidence that thou thyself art a leader of the blind, a light of those who [are] in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>thou then that teachest another, dost thou not teach thyself? thou that preachest not to steal, dost thou steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>thou that sayest [man should] not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>thou who boastest in law, dost thou by transgression of the law dishonour God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>For the name of God is blasphemed on your account among the nations, according as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>For circumcision indeed profits if thou keep [the] law; but if thou be a law-transgressor, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>If therefore the uncircumcision keep the requirements of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>and uncircumcision by nature, fulfilling the law, judge thee, who, with letter and circumcision, [art] a law-transgressor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For he is not a Jew who [is] one outwardly, neither that circumcision which is outward in flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>but he [is] a Jew [who is so] inwardly; and circumcision, of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What then [is] the superiority of the Jew? or what the profit of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much every way: and first, indeed, that to them were entrusted the oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For what? if some have not believed, shall their unbelief make the faith of God of none effect?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>Far be the thought: but let God be true, and every man false; according as it is written, So that thou shouldest be justified in thy words, and shouldest overcome when thou art in judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our unrighteousness commend God's righteousness, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak according to man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>Far be the thought: since how shall God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>For if the truth of God, in my lie, has more abounded to his glory, why yet am *I* also judged as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>and not, according as we are injuriously charged, and according as some affirm that we say, Let us practise evil things, that good ones may come? whose judgment is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? are we better? No, in no wise: for we have before charged both Jews and Greeks with being all under sin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>according as it is written, There is not a righteous [man], not even one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>there is not the [man] that understands, there is not one that seeks after God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>All have gone out of the way, they have together become unprofitable; there is not one that practises goodness, there is not so much as one:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; asps' poison [is] under their lips:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>swift their feet to shed blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>ruin and misery [are] in their ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>and way of peace they have not known:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>there is no fear of God before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know that whatever the things the law says, it speaks to those under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world be under judgment to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Wherefore by works of law no flesh shall be justified before him; for by law [is] knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now without law righteousness of God is manifested, borne witness to by the law and the prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ towards all, and upon all those who believe: for there is no difference;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which [is] in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood, for [the] shewing forth of his righteousness, in respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before, through the forbearance of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>for [the] shewing forth of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just, and justify him that is of [the] faith of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where then [is] boasting? It has been excluded. By what law? of works? Nay, but by law of faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>for we reckon that a man is justified by faith, without works of law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Is [God] the God of Jews only? is he not of [the] nations also? Yea, of nations also:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>since indeed [it is] one God who shall justify [the] circumcision on the principle of faith, and uncircumcision by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we then make void law by faith? Far be the thought: [no,] but we establish law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What shall we say then that Abraham our father according to flesh has found?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>For if Abraham has been justified on the principle of works, he has whereof to boast: but not before God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>for what does the scripture say? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>Now to him that works the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but of debt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>but to him who does not work, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>Even as David also declares the blessedness of the man to whom God reckons righteousness without works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>Blessed [they] whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>blessed [the] man to whom [the] Lord shall not at all reckon sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>[Does] this blessedness then [rest] on the circumcision, or also on the uncircumcision? For we say that faith has been reckoned to Abraham as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How then has it been reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And he received [the] sign of circumcision [as] seal of the righteousness of faith which [he had] being in uncircumcision, that he might be [the] father of all them that believe being in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned to them also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>and father of circumcision, not only to those who are of [the] circumcision, but to those also who walk in the steps of the faith, during uncircumcision, of our father Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For [it was] not by law that the promise was to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of [the] world, but by righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if they which [are] of law be heirs, faith is made vain, and the promise made of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>For law works wrath; but where no law is neither [is there] transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Therefore [it is] on the principle of faith, that [it might be] according to grace, in order to the promise being sure to all the seed, not to that only which [is] of the law, but to that also which [is] of Abraham's faith, who is father of us all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>(according as it is written, I have made thee father of many nations,) before the God whom he believed, who quickens the dead, and calls the things which be not as being;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>who against hope believed in hope to his becoming father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>and not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body already become dead, being about a hundred years old, and the deadening of Sarah's womb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>and hesitated not at the promise of God through unbelief; but found strength in faith, giving glory to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>and being fully persuaded that what he has promised he is able also to do;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>wherefore also it was reckoned to him as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now it was not written on his account alone that it was reckoned to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>but on ours also, to whom, believing on him who has raised from among [the] dead Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>who has been delivered for our offences and has been raised for our justification, it will be reckoned.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Therefore having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>by whom we have also access by faith into this favour in which we stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only [that], but we also boast in tribulations, knowing that tribulation works endurance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>and endurance, experience; and experience, hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>and hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by [the] Holy Spirit which has been given to us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>for we being still without strength, in [the] due time Christ has died for [the] ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>For scarcely for [the] just [man] will one die, for perhaps for [the] good [man] some one might also dare to die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>but God commends *his* love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Much rather therefore, having been now justified in [the power of] his blood, we shall be saved by him from wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much rather, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in [the power of] his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only [that], but [we are] making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we have received the reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>For this [cause], even as by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death; and thus death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>(for until law sin was in [the] world; but sin is not put to account when there is no law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>but death reigned from Adam until Moses, even upon those who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is [the] figure of him to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But [shall] not the act of favour [be] as the offence? For if by the offence of one the many have died, much rather has the grace of God, and the free gift in grace, which [is] by the one man Jesus Christ, abounded unto the many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And [shall] not as by one that has sinned [be] the gift? For the judgment [was] of one to condemnation, but the act of favour, of many offences unto justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if by the offence of the one death reigned by the one, much rather shall those who receive the abundance of grace, and of the free gift of righteousness, reign in life by the one Jesus Christ:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>so then as [it was] by one offence towards all men to condemnation, so by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For as indeed by the disobedience of the one man the many have been constituted sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>But law came in, in order that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded grace has overabounded,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>in order that, even as sin has reigned in [the power of] death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What then shall we say? Should we continue in sin that grace may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>Far be the thought. We who have died to sin, how shall we still live in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Are you ignorant that we, as many as have been baptised unto Christ Jesus, have been baptised unto his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>We have been buried therefore with him by baptism unto death, in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among [the] dead by the glory of the Father, so *we* also should walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For if we are become identified with [him] in the likeness of his death, so also we shall be of [his] resurrection;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For he that has died is justified from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>knowing that Christ having been raised up from among [the] dead dies no more: death has dominion over him no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>For in that he has died, he has died to sin once for all; but in that he lives, he lives to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>So also *ye*, reckon yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body to obey its lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>Neither yield your members instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but yield yourselves to God as alive from among [the] dead, and your members instruments of righteousness to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>For sin shall not have dominion over *you*, for ye are not under law but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? should we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Far be the thought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves bondmen for obedience, ye are bondmen to him whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>But thanks [be] to God, that ye were bondmen of sin, but have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which ye were instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>Now, having got your freedom from sin, ye have become bondmen to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>I speak humanly on account of the weakness of your flesh. For even as ye have yielded your members in bondage to uncleanness and to lawlessness unto lawlessness, so now yield your members in bondage to righteousness unto holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>For when ye were bondmen of sin ye were free from righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>What fruit therefore had ye *then* in the things of which ye are *now* ashamed? for the end of *them* [is] death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But *now*, having got your freedom from sin, and having become bondmen to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.23'>For the wages of sin [is] death; but the act of favour of God, eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Are ye ignorant, brethren, (for I speak to those knowing law,) that law rules over a man as long as he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For the married woman is bound by law to her husband so long as he is alive; but if the husband should die, she is clear from the law of the husband:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>so then, the husband being alive, she shall be called an adulteress if she be to another man; but if the husband should die, she is free from the law, so as not to be an adulteress, though she be to another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>So that, my brethren, *ye* also have been made dead to the law by the body of the Christ, to be to another, who has been raised up from among [the] dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins, which [were] by the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>but now we are clear from the law, having died in that in which we were held, so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What shall we say then? [is] the law sin? Far be the thought. But I had not known sin, unless by law: for I had not had conscience also of lust unless the law had said, Thou shalt not lust;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>but sin, getting a point of attack by the commandment, wrought in me every lust; for without law sin [was] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>But *I* was alive without law once; but the commandment having come, sin revived, but *I* died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>And the commandment, which [was] for life, was found, [as] to me, itself [to be] unto death:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>for sin, getting a point of attack by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew [me].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>So that the law indeed [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Did then that which is good become death to me? Far be the thought. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death to me by that which is good; in order that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>For we know that the law is spiritual: but *I* am fleshly, sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For that which I do, I do not own: for not what I will, this I do; but what I hate, this I practise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>But if what I do not will, this I practise, I consent to the law that [it is] right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>Now then [it is] no longer *I* [that] do it, but the sin that dwells in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell: for to will is there with me, but to do right [I find] not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For I do not practise the good that I will; but the evil I do not will, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>But if what *I* do not will, this I practise, [it is] no longer *I* [that] do it, but the sin that dwells in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>I find then the law upon *me* who will to practise what is right, that with *me* evil is there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>but I see another law in my members, warring in opposition to the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which exists in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>O wretched man that I [am]! who shall deliver me out of this body of death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then *I* *myself* with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>[There is] then now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>in order that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>For they that are according to flesh mind the things of the flesh; and they that are according to Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>For the mind of the flesh [is] death; but the mind of the Spirit life and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God; for neither indeed can it be:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>and they that are in flesh cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But *ye* are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God's Spirit dwell in you; but if any one has not [the] Spirit of Christ *he* is not of him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>but if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>But if the Spirit of him that has raised up Jesus from among [the] dead dwell in you, he that has raised up Christ from among [the] dead shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>for if ye live according to flesh, ye are about to die; but if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>for as many as are led by [the] Spirit of God, *these* are sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye have received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>And if children, heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ's joint heirs; if indeed we suffer with [him], that we may also be glorified with [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory to be revealed to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the anxious looking out of the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>for the creature has been made subject to vanity, not of its will, but by reason of him who has subjected [the same], in hope</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>that the creature itself also shall be set free from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not only [that], but even *we* ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, we also ourselves groan in ourselves, awaiting adoption, [that is] the redemption of our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For we have been saved in hope; but hope seen is not hope; for what any one sees, why does he also hope?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if what we see not we hope, we expect in patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>And in like manner the Spirit joins also its help to our weakness; for we do not know what we should pray for as is fitting, but the Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>But he who searches the hearts knows what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for saints according to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>But we *do* know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.29'>Because whom he has foreknown, he has also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be [the] firstborn among many brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.30'>But whom he has predestinated, these also he has called; and whom he has called, these also he has justified; but whom he has justified, these also he has glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>What shall we then say to these things? If God [be] for us, who against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>He who, yea, has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him grant us all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who shall bring an accusation against God's elect? [It is] God who justifies:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>who is he that condemns? [It is] Christ who has died, but rather has been [also] raised up; who is also at the right hand of God; who also intercedes for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>According as it is written, For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which [is] in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.1'>I say [the] truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in [the] Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.2'>that I have great grief and uninterrupted pain in my heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.3'>for I have wished, I myself, to be a curse from the Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.4'>who are Israelites; whose [is] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the law-giving, and the service, and the promises;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.5'>whose [are] the fathers; and of whom, as according to flesh, [is] the Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.6'>Not however as though the word of God had failed; for not all [are] Israel which [are] of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.7'>nor because they are seed of Abraham [are] all children: but, In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.8'>That is, [they that are] the children of the flesh, these [are] not the children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned as seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.9'>For this word [is] of promise, According to this time I will come, and there shall be a son to Sarah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.10'>And not only [that], but Rebecca having conceived by one, Isaac our father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.11'>[the children] indeed being not yet born, or having done anything good or worthless (that the purpose of God according to election might abide, not of works, but of him that calls),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.12'>it was said to her, The greater shall serve the less:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.13'>according as it is written, I have loved Jacob, and I have hated Esau.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.14'>What shall we say then? [Is there] unrighteousness with God? Far be the thought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.15'>For he says to Moses, I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy, and I will feel compassion for whom I will feel compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.16'>So then [it is] not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shews mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.17'>For the scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very thing I have raised thee up from amongst [men], that I might thus shew in thee my power, and so that my name should be declared in all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.18'>So then, to whom he will he shews mercy, and whom he will he hardens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.19'>Thou wilt say to me then, Why does he yet find fault? for who resists his purpose?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.20'>Aye, but thou, O man, who art *thou* that answerest again to God? Shall the thing formed say to him that has formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.21'>Or has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honour, and another to dishonour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.22'>And if God, minded to shew his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.23'>and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.24'>us, whom he has also called, not only from amongst [the] Jews, but also from amongst [the] nations?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.25'>As he says also in Hosea, I will call not-my-people My people; and the-not-beloved Beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.26'>And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them, *Ye* [are] not my people, there shall they be called Sons of [the] living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.27'>But Esaias cries concerning Israel, Should the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.28'>for [he] is bringing the matter to an end, and [cutting [it] short in righteousness; because] a cutting short of the matter will [the] Lord accomplish upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.29'>And according as Esaias said before, Unless [the] Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and made like even as Gomorrha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.30'>What then shall we say? That [they of the] nations, who did not follow after righteousness, have attained righteousness, but [the] righteousness that is on the principle of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.31'>But Israel, pursuing after a law of righteousness, has not attained to [that] law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.32'>Wherefore? Because [it was] not on the principle of faith, but as of works. They have stumbled at the stumblingstone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.33'>according as it is written, Behold, I place in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offence: and he that believes on him shall not be ashamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.1'>Brethren, the delight of my own heart and my supplication which [I address] to God for them is for salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.2'>For I bear them witness that they have zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.3'>For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own [righteousness], have not submitted to the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.4'>For Christ is [the] end of law for righteousness to every one that believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.5'>For Moses lays down in writing the righteousness which is of the law, The man who has practised those things shall live by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.6'>But the righteousness of faith speaks thus: Do not say in thine heart, Who shall ascend to the heavens? that is, to bring Christ down;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.7'>or, Who shall descend into the abyss? that is, to bring up Christ from among [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.8'>But what says it? The word is near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.9'>that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from among [the] dead, thou shalt be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.10'>For with [the] heart is believed to righteousness; and with [the] mouth confession made to salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.11'>For the scripture says, No one believing on him shall be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.12'>For there is no difference of Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all [is] rich towards all that call upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.13'>For every one whosoever, who shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.14'>How then shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without one who preaches?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.15'>and how shall they preach unless they have been sent? according as it is written, How beautiful the feet of them that announce glad tidings of peace, of them that announce glad tidings of good things!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.16'>But they have not all obeyed the glad tidings. For Esaias says, Lord, who has believed our report?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.17'>So faith then [is] by a report, but the report by God's word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.18'>But I say, Have they not heard? Yea, surely, Their voice has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the extremities of the habitable world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.19'>But I say, Has not Israel known? First, Moses says, *I* will provoke you to jealousy through [them that are] not a nation: through a nation without understanding I will anger you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.20'>But Esaias is very bold, and says, I have been found by those not seeking me; I have become manifest to those not inquiring after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.21'>But unto Israel he says, All the day long I have stretched out my hands unto a people disobeying and opposing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.1'>I say then, Has God cast away his people? Far be the thought. For *I* also am an Israelite, of [the] seed of Abraham, of [the] tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.2'>God has not cast away his people whom he foreknew. Know ye not what the scripture says in [the history of] Elias, how he pleads with God against Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.3'>Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have dug down thine altars; and *I* have been left alone, and they seek my life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.4'>But what says the divine answer to him? I have left to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed knee to Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.5'>Thus, then, in the present time also there has been a remnant according to election of grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.6'>But if by grace, no longer of works: since [otherwise] grace is no more grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.7'>What [is it] then? What Israel seeks for, that he has not obtained; but the election has obtained, and the rest have been blinded,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.8'>according as it is written, God has given to them a spirit of slumber, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear, unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.9'>And David says, Let their table be for a snare, and for a gin, and for a fall-trap, and for a recompense to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.10'>let their eyes be darkened not to see, and bow down their back alway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.11'>I say then, Have they stumbled in order that they might fall? Far be the thought: but by their fall [there is] salvation to the nations to provoke them to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.12'>But if their fall [be the] world's wealth, and their loss [the] wealth of [the] nations, how much rather their fulness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.13'>For I speak to you, the nations, inasmuch as *I* am apostle of nations, I glorify my ministry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.14'>if by any means I shall provoke to jealousy [them which are] my flesh, and shall save some from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.15'>For if their casting away [be the] world's reconciliation, what [their] reception but life from among [the] dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.16'>Now if the first-fruit [be] holy, the lump also; and if the root [be] holy, the branches also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.17'>Now if some of the branches have been broken out, and *thou*, being a wild olive tree, hast been grafted in amongst them, and hast become a fellow-partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.18'>boast not against the branches; but if thou boast, [it is] not *thou* bearest the root, but the root thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.19'>Thou wilt say then, The branches have been broken out in order that *I* might be grafted in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>Right: they have been broken out through unbelief, and *thou* standest through faith. Be not high-minded, but fear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>if God indeed has not spared the natural branches; lest it might be he spare not thee either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>Behold then [the] goodness and severity of God: upon them who have fallen, severity; upon thee goodness of God, if thou shalt abide in goodness, since [otherwise] *thou* also wilt be cut away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>And *they* too, if they abide not in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able again to graft them in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>For if *thou* hast been cut out of the olive tree wild by nature, and, contrary to nature, hast been grafted into the good olive tree, how much rather shall they, who are according to nature be grafted into their own olive tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, that ye may not be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the nations be come in;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>and so all Israel shall be saved. According as it is written, The deliverer shall come out of Zion; he shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>And this is the covenant from me to them, when I shall have taken away their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>As regards the glad tidings, [they are] enemies on your account; but as regards election, beloved on account of the fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>For the gifts and the calling of God [are] not subject to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>For as indeed *ye* [also] once have not believed in God, but now have been objects of mercy through the unbelief of *these*;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>so these also have now not believed in your mercy, in order that *they* also may be objects of mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>For God hath shut up together all in unbelief, in order that he might shew mercy to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>O depth of riches both of [the] wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable his judgments, and untraceable his ways!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.34'>For who has known [the] mind of [the] Lord, or who has been his counsellor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.35'>or who has first given to him, and it shall be rendered to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.36'>For of him, and through him, and for him [are] all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.1'>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, [which is] your intelligent service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.2'>And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of [your] mind, that ye may prove what [is] the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>For I say, through the grace which has been given to me, to every one that is among you, not to have high thoughts above what he should think; but to think so as to be wise, as God has dealt to each a measure of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.4'>For, as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.5'>thus we, [being] many, are one body in Christ, and each one members one of the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.6'>But having different gifts, according to the grace which has been given to us, whether [it be] prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.7'>or service, [let us occupy ourselves] in service; or he that teaches, in teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.8'>or he that exhorts, in exhortation; he that gives, in simplicity; he that leads, with diligence; he that shews mercy, with cheerfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.9'>Let love be unfeigned; abhorring evil; cleaving to good:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.10'>as to brotherly love, kindly affectioned towards one another: as to honour, each taking the lead in paying it to the other:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.11'>as to diligent zealousness, not slothful; in spirit fervent; serving the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.12'>As regards hope, rejoicing: as regards tribulation, enduring: as regards prayer, persevering:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.13'>distributing to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.14'>Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.15'>Rejoice with those that rejoice, weep with those that weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.16'>Have the same respect one for another, not minding high things, but going along with the lowly: be not wise in your own eyes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.17'>recompensing to no one evil for evil: providing things honest before all men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.18'>if possible, as far as depends on you, living in peace with all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.19'>not avenging yourselves, beloved, but give place to wrath; for it is written, Vengeance [belongs] to me, *I* will recompense, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.20'>If therefore thine enemy should hunger, feed him; if he should thirst, give him drink; for, so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.21'>Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>Let every soul be subject to the authorities that are above [him]. For there is no authority except from God; and those that exist are set up by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>So that he that sets himself in opposition to the authority resists the ordinance of God; and they who [thus] resist shall bring sentence of guilt on themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For rulers are not a terror to a good work, but to an evil [one]. Dost thou desire then not to be afraid of the authority? practise [what is] good, and thou shalt have praise from it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>for it is God's minister to thee for good. But if thou practisest evil, fear; for it bears not the sword in vain; for it is God's minister, an avenger for wrath to him that does evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>Wherefore it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>For on this account ye pay tribute also; for they are God's officers, attending continually on this very thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>Render to all their dues: to whom tribute [is due], tribute; to whom custom, custom; to whom fear, fear; to whom honour, honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>Owe no one anything, unless to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>For, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not lust; and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.10'>Love works no ill to its neighbour; love therefore [is the] whole law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.11'>This also, knowing the time, that it is already time that *we* should be aroused out of sleep; for now [is] our salvation nearer than when we believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.12'>The night is far spent, and the day is near; let us cast away therefore the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.13'>As in the day, let us walk becomingly; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and lasciviousness, not in strife and emulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.14'>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take forethought for the flesh to [fulfil its] lusts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.1'>Now him that is weak in the faith receive, not to [the] determining of questions of reasoning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.2'>One man is assured that he may eat all things; but the weak eats herbs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>Let not him that eats make little of him that eats not; and let not him that eats not judge him that eats: for God has received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Who art *thou* that judgest the servant of another? to his own master he stands or falls. And he shall be made to stand; for the Lord is able to make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>One man esteems day more than day; another esteems every day [alike]. Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>He that regards the day, regards it to [the] Lord. And he that eats, eats to [the] Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that does not eat, [it is] to [the] Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>For both if we should live, [it is] to the Lord we live; and if we should die, [it is] to the Lord we die: both if we should live then, and if we should die, we are the Lord's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.9'>For to this [end] Christ has died and lived [again], that he might rule over both dead and living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or again, thou, why dost thou make little of thy brother? for we shall all be placed before the judgment-seat of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.11'>For it is written, *I* live, saith [the] Lord, that to me shall bow every knee, and every tongue shall confess to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.12'>So then each of us shall give an account concerning himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>Let us no longer therefore judge one another; but judge ye this rather, not to put a stumbling-block or a fall-trap before his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except to him who reckons anything to be unclean, to that man [it is] unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>For if on account of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer according to love. Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ has died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>Let not then your good be evil spoken of;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>For he that in this serves the Christ [is] acceptable to God and approved of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>So then let us pursue the things which tend to peace, and things whereby one shall build up another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>For the sake of meat do not destroy the work of God. All things indeed [are] pure; but [it is] evil to that man who eats while stumbling [in doing so].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>[It is] right not to eat meat, nor drink wine, nor [do anything] in which thy brother stumbles, or is offended, or is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>Hast *thou* faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Blessed [is] he who does not judge himself in what he allows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.23'>But he that doubts, if he eat, is condemned; because [it is] not of faith; but whatever [is] not of faith is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.1'>But *we* ought, we that are strong, to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.2'>Let each one of us please his neighbour with a view to what is good, to edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.3'>For the Christ also did not please himself; but according as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproach thee have fallen upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.4'>For as many things as have been written before have been written for our instruction, that through endurance and through encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.5'>Now the God of endurance and of encouragement give to you to be like-minded one toward another, according to Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.6'>that ye may with one accord, with one mouth, glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.7'>Wherefore receive ye one another, according as the Christ also has received you to [the] glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.8'>For I say that Jesus Christ became a minister of [the] circumcision for [the] truth of God, to confirm the promises of the fathers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.9'>and that the nations should glorify God for mercy; according as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among [the] nations, and will sing to thy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.10'>And again he says, Rejoice, nations, with his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.11'>And again, Praise the Lord, all [ye] nations, and let all the peoples laud him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.12'>And again, Esaias says, There shall be the root of Jesse, and one that arises, to rule over [the] nations: in him shall [the] nations hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.13'>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that ye should abound in hope by [the] power of [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.14'>But I am persuaded, my brethren, I myself also, concerning you, that yourselves also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>But I have written to you the more boldly, [brethren,] in part, as putting you in mind, because of the grace given to me by God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.16'>for me to be minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, carrying on as a sacrificial service the [message of] glad tidings of God, in order that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, sanctified by [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.17'>I have therefore [whereof to] boast in Christ Jesus in the things which pertain to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>For I will not dare to speak anything of the things which Christ has not wrought by me, for [the] obedience of [the] nations, by word and deed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>in [the] power of signs and wonders, in [the] power of [the] Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>and so aiming to announce the glad tidings, not where Christ has been named, that I might not build upon another's foundation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>but according as it is written, To whom there was nothing told concerning him, they shall see; and they that have not heard shall understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>Wherefore also I have been often hindered from coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>But now, having no longer place in these regions, and having great desire to come to you these many years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>whenever I should go to Spain; (for I hope to see you as I go through, and by you to be set forward thither, if first I shall have been in part filled with your company;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>but now I go to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>for Macedonia and Achaia have been well pleased to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who [are] in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>They have been well pleased indeed, and they are their debtors; for if the nations have participated in their spiritual things, they ought also in fleshly to minister to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>Having finished this therefore, and having sealed to them this fruit, I will set off by you into Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>But I know that, coming to you, I shall come in [the] fulness of [the] blessing of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>But I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in prayers for me to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>that I may be saved from those that do not believe in Judaea; and that my ministry which [I have] for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;</verse>
