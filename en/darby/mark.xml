      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>as it is written in [Isaiah] the prophet, Behold, *I* send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>Voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of [the] Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>There came John baptising in the wilderness, and preaching [the] baptism of repentance for remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And there went out to him all the district of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem, and were baptised by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>And John was clothed in camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And he preached, saying, There comes he that is mightier than I after me, the thong of whose sandals I am not fit to stoop down and unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>*I* indeed have baptised you with water, but *he* shall baptise you with [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it came to pass in those days [that] Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptised by John at the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And straightway going up from the water, he saw the heavens parting asunder, and the Spirit, as a dove, descending upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And there came a voice out of the heavens: *Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And immediately the Spirit drives him out into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>But after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying, The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn nigh; repent and believe in the glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew, [Simon's] brother, casting out a net in the sea, for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>and straightway leaving their trawl-nets they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And going on thence a little, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, and these [were] in the ship repairing the trawl-nets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>and straightway he called them; and leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, they went away after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they go into Capernaum. And straightway on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And there was in their synagogue a man [possessed] by an unclean spirit, and he cried out</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>saying, Eh! what have we to do with thee, Jesus, Nazarene? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace and come out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And the unclean spirit, having torn him, and uttered a cry with a loud voice, came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And all were amazed, so that they questioned together among themselves, saying, What is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And his fame went out straightway into the whole region of Galilee around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And straightway going out of the synagogue, they came with James and John into the house of Simon and Andrew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>And the mother-in-law of Simon lay in a fever. And straightway they speak to him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And he went up to [her] and raised her up, having taken her by the hand, and straightway the fever left her, and she served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>But evening being come, when the sun had gone down, they brought to him all that were suffering, and those possessed by demons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>and the whole city was gathered together at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And he healed many suffering from various diseases; and he cast out many demons, and did not suffer the demons to speak because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And rising in the morning long before day, he went out and went away into a desert place, and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon and those with him went after him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>and having found him, they say to him, All seek thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And he says to them, Let us go elsewhere into the neighbouring country towns, that I may preach there also, for for this purpose am I come forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he was preaching in their synagogues in the whole of Galilee, and casting out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And there comes to him a leper, beseeching him, and falling on his knees to him, and saying to him, If thou wilt thou canst cleanse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>But Jesus, moved with compassion, having stretched out his hand, touched him, and says to him, I will, be thou cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And as he spoke straightway the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And having sharply charged him, he straightway sent him away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and says to him, See thou say nothing to any one, but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses ordained, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he, having gone forth, began to proclaim [it] much, and to spread the matter abroad, so that he could no longer enter openly into the city, but was without in desert places, and they came to him from every side.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And he entered again into Capernaum after [several] days, and it was reported that he was at [the] house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>and straightway many were gathered together, so that there was no longer any room, not even at the door; and he spoke the word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And there come to him [men] bringing a paralytic, borne by four;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>and, not being able to get near to him on account of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was, and having dug [it] up they let down the couch on which the paralytic lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>But Jesus, seeing their faith, says to the paralytic, Child, thy sins are forgiven [thee].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>But certain of the scribes were there sitting, and reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Why does this [man] thus speak? he blasphemes. Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And straightway Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they are reasoning thus within themselves, said to them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, [Thy] sins are forgiven [thee]; or to say, Arise, and take up thy couch and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, he says to the paralytic,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>To thee I say, Arise, take up thy couch and go to thine house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And he rose up straightway, and, having taken up his couch, went out before [them] all, so that all were amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>And he went out again by the sea, and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And passing by, he saw Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the tax-office, and says to him, Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And it came to pass as he lay at table in his house, that many tax-gatherers and sinners lay at table with Jesus and his disciples; for they were many, and they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing him eating with sinners and tax-gatherers, said to his disciples, Why [is it] that he eats and drinks with tax-gatherers and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>And Jesus having heard [it] says to them, They that are strong have not need of a physician, but those who are ill. I have not come to call righteous [men], but sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting; and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and [the disciples] of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But days will come when the bridegroom shall have been taken away from them, and then shall they fast in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment: otherwise its new filling-up takes from the old [stuff], and there is a worse rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no one puts new wine into old skins; otherwise the wine bursts the skins, and the wine is poured out, and the skins will be destroyed; but new wine is to be put into new skins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>And it came to pass that he went on the sabbath through the cornfields; and his disciples began to walk on, plucking the ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath what is not lawful?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And *he* said to them, Have ye never read what David did when he had need and hungered, *he* and those with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>how he entered into the house of God, in [the section of] Abiathar [the] high priest, and ate the shew-bread, which it is not lawful unless for the priests to eat, and gave even to those that were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said to them, The sabbath was made on account of man, not man on account of the sabbath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>so that the Son of man is lord of the sabbath also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was there a man having his hand dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they watched him if he would heal him on the sabbath, that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he says to the man who had his hand dried up, Rise up [and come] into the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>And he says to them, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill? But they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And looking round upon them with anger, distressed at the hardening of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched [it] out, and his hand was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>And the Pharisees going out straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea and beyond the Jordan; and they of around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard what things he did, came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he spoke to his disciples, in order that a little ship should wait upon him on account of the crowd, that they might not press upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he healed many, so that they beset him that they might touch him, as many as had plagues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And the unclean spirits, when they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried saying, *Thou* art the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And he rebuked them much, that they might not make him manifest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And he goes up into the mountain, and calls whom he himself would, and they went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And he appointed twelve that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have power [to heal diseases, and] to cast out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And he gave to Simon the surname of Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>and James the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and he gave them the surname of Boanerges, that is, Sons of thunder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariote, who also delivered him up. And they come to [the] house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And again a crowd comes together, so that they cannot even eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And his relatives having heard [of it] went out to lay hold on him, for they said, He is out of his mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and, By the prince of the demons he casts out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And having called them to [him], he said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>And if a kingdom has become divided against itself, that kingdom cannot subsist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a house has become divided against itself, that house cannot subsist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>And if Satan rise up against himself, and is divided, he cannot subsist, but has an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>But no one can, having entered into his house, plunder the goods of the strong [man] unless he first bind the strong [man], and then he will plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Verily I say unto you, that all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and all the injurious speeches [with] which they may speak injuriously;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>but whosoever shall speak injuriously against the Holy Spirit, to eternity has no forgiveness; but lies under the guilt of an everlasting sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>because they said, He has an unclean spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>And his brethren and his mother come, and standing without sent to him calling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And a crowd sat around him. And they said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren seek thee without.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And looking around in a circuit at those that were sitting around him, he says, Behold my mother and my brethren:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>for whosoever shall do the will of God, *he* is my brother, and sister, and mother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And again he began to teach by the sea. And a great crowd was gathered together to him, so that going on board ship he sat in the sea, and all the crowd were close to the sea on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he taught them many things in parables. And he said to them in his doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And it came to pass as he sowed, one fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And another fell on the rocky ground, where it had not much earth, and immediately it sprung up out [of the ground] because it had no depth of earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>and when the sun arose it was burnt up, and because of its not having any root, it withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And another fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>And another fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and bore, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he was alone, those about him with the twelve asked him [as to] the parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And he said to them, To you is given [to know] the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to them who are without, all things are done in parables,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>that beholding they may behold and not see, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest it may be, they should be converted and they should be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he says to them, Do ye not know this parable? and how will ye be acquainted with all the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower sows the word:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown, and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these are they in like manner who are sown upon the rocky places, who when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>and they have no root in themselves, but are for a time: then, tribulation arising, or persecution on account of the word, immediately they are offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And others are they who are sown among the thorns: these are they who have heard the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>and the cares of life, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things, entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And these are they who have been sown on the good ground, such as hear the word and receive it, and bear fruit; one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred [fold].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he said to them, Does the lamp come that it should be put under the bushel or under the couch? [Is it] not that it should be set upon the lamp-stand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is nothing hidden which shall not be made manifest; nor does any secret thing take place, but that it should come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any one have ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear; with what measure ye mete, it shall be meted to you; and there shall be [more] added to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For whosoever has, to him shall be given; and he who has not, even what he has shall be taken from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he said, Thus is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast the seed upon the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>and should sleep and rise up night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he does not know how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>The earth bears fruit of itself, first [the] blade, then an ear, then full corn in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the fruit is produced, immediately he sends the sickle, for the harvest is come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And he said, How should we liken the kingdom of God, or with what comparison should we compare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>As to a grain of mustard [seed], which, when it is sown upon the earth, is less than all seeds which are upon the earth,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>but without a parable spoke he not to them; and in private he explained all things to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>And on that day, when evening was come, he says to them, Let us go over to the other side:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And there comes a violent gust of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it already filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>And *he* was in the stern sleeping on the cushion. And they awake him up and say to him, Teacher, dost thou not care that we are perishing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And awaking up he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Silence; be mute. And the wind fell, and there was a great calm.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>And they feared [with] great fear, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>And they came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And immediately on his going out of the ship there met him out of the tombs a man possessed by an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>who had his dwelling in the tombs; and no one was able to bind him, not even with chains;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn asunder by him, and the fetters were shattered; and no one was able to subdue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And continually night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>But seeing Jesus from afar off, he ran and did him homage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>and crying with a loud voice he says, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, torment me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For he said to him, Come forth, unclean spirit, out of the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And he asked him, What is thy name? And he says to him, Legion is my name, because we are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now there was there just at the mountain a great herd of swine feeding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>and they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine that we may enter into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>And Jesus [immediately] allowed them. And the unclean spirits going out entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep slope, into the sea (about two thousand), and were choked in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>And those that were feeding them fled and reported it in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that had taken place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>And they come to Jesus, and they see the possessed of demons sitting [and] clothed and sensible, [him] that had had the legion: and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And they that had seen [it] related to them how it had happened to the [man] possessed by demons, and concerning the swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>And they began to beg him to depart from their coasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And as he went on board ship, the man that had been possessed by demons besought him that he might be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>And he suffered him not, but says to him, Go to thine home to thine own people, and tell them how great things the Lord has done for thee, and has had mercy on thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him; and all wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>And Jesus having passed over in the ship again to the other side, a great crowd gathered to him; and he was by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>And [behold] there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue, by name Jairus, and seeing him, falls down at his feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>and he besought him much, saying, My little daughter is at extremity; [I pray] that thou shouldest come and lay thy hands upon her so that she may be healed, and may live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And he went with him, and a large crowd followed him and pressed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>And a certain woman who had had a flux of blood twelve years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>and had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent everything she had and had found no advantage from it, but had rather got worse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>having heard concerning Jesus, came in the crowd behind and touched his clothes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>for she said, If I shall touch but his clothes I shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>And immediately her fountain of blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she was cured from the scourge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>And immediately Jesus, knowing in himself the power that had gone out of him, turning round in the crowd said, Who has touched my clothes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the crowd pressing on thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And he looked round about to see her who had done this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>But the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had taken place in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith has healed thee; go in peace, and be well of thy scourge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he was yet speaking, they come from the ruler of the synagogue's [house], saying, Thy daughter has died, why troublest thou the teacher any further?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But Jesus [immediately], having heard the word spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not; only believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And he suffered no one to accompany him save Peter and James, and John the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sees the tumult, and people weeping and wailing greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And entering in he says to them, Why do ye make a tumult and weep? the child has not died, but sleeps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they derided him. But he, having put [them] all out, takes with [him] the father of the child, and the mother, and those that were with him, and enters in where the child was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>And having laid hold of the hand of the child, he says to her, Talitha koumi, which is, interpreted, Damsel, I say to thee, Arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>And immediately the damsel arose and walked, for she was twelve years old. And they were astonished with great astonishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>And he charged them much that no one should know this; and he desired that [something] should be given her to eat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>And he went out thence and came to his own country, and his disciples follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>And when sabbath was come he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing were amazed, saying, Whence [has] this [man] these things? and what [is] the wisdom that is given to him, and such works of power are done by his hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And he wondered because of their unbelief. And he went round the villages in a circuit, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And he calls the twelve to [him]; and he began to send them out two [and] two, and gave to them power over the unclean spirits;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>And he said to them, Wheresoever ye shall enter into a house, there remain till ye shall go thence.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>And they went forth and preached that they should repent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>and they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many infirm, and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>And Herod the king heard [of him] (for his name had become public), and said, John the baptist is risen from among [the] dead, and on this account works of power are wrought by him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>And a holiday being come, when Herod, on his birthday, made a supper to his grandees, and to the chiliarchs, and the chief [men] of Galilee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>and the daughter of the same Herodias having come in, and danced, pleased Herod and those that were with [him] at table; and the king said to the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and I will give it thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>And he swore to her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask me I will give thee, to half of my kingdom.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>And they took up of fragments the fillings of twelve hand-baskets, and of the fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>And those that ate of the loaves were five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>And immediately he compelled his disciples to go on board ship, and to go on before to the other side to Bethsaida, while *he* sends the crowd away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>And when evening was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and *he* alone upon the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>And seeing them labouring in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them walking on the sea, and would have passed them by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>But they, seeing him walking on the sea, thought that it was an apparition, and cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>For all saw him and were troubled. And immediately he spoke with them, and says to them, Be of good courage: it is *I*; be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>And he went up to them into the ship, and the wind fell. And they were exceedingly beyond measure astonished in themselves and wondered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>for they understood not through the loaves: for their heart was hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret and made the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>And on their coming out of the ship, immediately recognising him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And wherever he entered into villages, or cities, or the country, they laid the sick in the market-places, and besought him that they might touch if it were only the hem of his garment; and as many as touched him were healed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>(for the Pharisees and all the Jews, unless they wash their hands diligently, do not eat, holding what has been delivered by the ancients;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>then the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why do thy disciples not walk according to what has been delivered by the ancients, but eat the bread with defiled hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>But he answering said to them, Well did Esaias prophesy concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far away from me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>and to love him with all the heart, and with all the intelligence, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbour as one's self, is more than all the burnt-offerings and sacrifices.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But he was silent, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and says to him, *Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>And Jesus said, *I* am, and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>And the high priest, having rent his clothes, says, What need have we any more of witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>Ye have heard the blasphemy; what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>And some began to spit upon him, and cover up his face, and buffet him, and say to him, Prophesy; and the officers struck him with the palms of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>And Peter being below in the palace-court, there comes one of the maids of the high priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>and seeing Peter warming himself, having looked at him, says, And *thou* wast with the Nazarene, Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied, saying, I know not nor understand what thou sayest. And he went out into the vestibule; and a cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>And the maid, seeing him, again began to say to those that stood by, This is [one] of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>And he again denied. And again, after a little, those that stood by said to Peter, Truly thou art [one] of them, for also thou art a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>But he began to curse and to swear, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And the second time a cock crew. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus said to him, Before [the] cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice; and when he thought thereon he wept.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>And immediately in the morning the chief priests, having taken counsel with the elders and scribes and the whole sanhedrim, bound Jesus and carried [him] away, and delivered [him] up to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>And Pilate asked him, Art *thou* the King of the Jews? And he answered and said to him, *Thou* sayest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>And the chief priests accused him urgently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? See of how many things they bear witness against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marvelled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>But at [the] feast he released to them one prisoner, whomsoever they begged [of him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>Now there was the [person] named Barabbas bound with those who had made insurrection with [him], [and] that had committed murder in the insurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>And the crowd crying out began to beg [that he would do] to them as he had always done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>But Pilate answered them saying, Will ye that I release to you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up through envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd that he might rather release Barabbas to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>And Pilate answering said to them again, What will ye then that I do [to him] whom ye call King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>And they cried out again, Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>And Pilate said to them, What evil then has he done? But they cried out the more urgently, Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>And Pilate, desirous of contenting the crowd, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, that he might be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>And the soldiers led him away into the court which is [called the] praetorium, and they call together the whole band.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>And they clothe him with purple, and bind round on him a crown of thorns which they had plaited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>And they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>And they struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and, bending the knee, did him homage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked him, they took the purple off him, and put his own clothes on him; and they lead him out that they may crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they compel to go [with them] a certain passer-by, Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that he might carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they bring him to the place [called] Golgotha, which, being interpreted, is Place of a skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>And they offered him wine [to drink] medicated with myrrh; but he did not take [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And having crucified him, they part his clothes amongst [themselves], casting lots on them, what each one should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And the superscription of what he was accused of was written up: The King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And with him they crucify two robbers, one on his right hand, and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>[And the scripture was fulfilled which says, And he was reckoned with the lawless.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And they that passed by reviled him, shaking their heads, and saying, Aha, thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>save thyself, and descend from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>In like manner the chief priests also, with the scribes, mocking with one another, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let the Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and may believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>And when [the] sixth hour was come, there came darkness over the whole land until [the] ninth hour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>and at the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, [saying], Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>And some of those who stood by, when they heard [it], said, Behold, he calls for Elias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>And one, running and filling a sponge with vinegar, fixed it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone, let us see if Elias comes to take him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>And Jesus, having uttered a loud cry, expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>And the centurion who stood by over against him, when he saw that he had expired having thus cried out, said, Truly this man was Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>And there were women also looking on from afar off, among whom were both Mary of Magdala, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him and ministered to him; and many others who came up with him to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>And when it was already evening, since it was [the] preparation, that is, [the day] before a sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable councillor, who also himself was awaiting the kingdom of God, coming, emboldened himself and went in to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>And Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and having called to [him] the centurion, he inquired of him if he had long died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And when he knew from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And having bought fine linen, [and] having taken him down, he swathed him in the fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was cut out of rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>And Mary of Magdala and Mary the [mother] of Joses saw where he was put.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>And the sabbath being [now] past, Mary of Magdala, and Mary the [mother] of James, and Salome, bought aromatic spices that they might come and embalm him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very early on the first [day] of the week they come to the sepulchre, the sun having risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they said to one another, Who shall roll us away the stone out of the door of the sepulchre?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>And when they looked, they see that the stone has been rolled [away], for it was very great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a white robe, and they were amazed and alarmed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>but he says to them, Be not alarmed. Ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, the crucified one. He is risen, he is not here; behold the place where they had put him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, he goes before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him, as he said to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>And they went out, and fled from the sepulchre. And trembling and excessive amazement possessed them, and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Now when he had risen very early, the first [day] of the week, he appeared first to Mary of Magdala, out of whom he had cast seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>*She* went and brought word to those that had been with him, [who were] grieving and weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>And when these heard that he was alive and had been seen of her, they disbelieved [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>And after these things he was manifested in another form to two of them as they walked, going into the country;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>and *they* went and brought word to the rest; neither did they believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Afterwards as they lay at table he was manifested to the eleven, and reproached [them with] their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen him risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And he said to them, Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He that believes and is baptised shall be saved, and he that disbelieves shall be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And these signs shall follow those that have believed: in my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>they shall take up serpents; and if they should drink any deadly thing it shall not injure them; they shall lay hands upon the infirm, and they shall be well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>The Lord therefore, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>And they, going forth, preached everywhere, the Lord working with [them], and confirming the word by the signs following upon [it].</verse>
