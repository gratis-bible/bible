And I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I lifted up mine eyes and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; and one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward, and no beast could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; and he did according to his will, and became great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged with him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; and he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the he-goat became exceeding great; but when he was become strong, the great horn was broken; and in its stead came up four notable ones toward the four winds of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beauty [of the earth].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it became great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down [some] of the host and of the stars to the ground, and trampled upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>(And he magnified [himself] even to the prince of the host, and from him the continual [sacrifice] was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And a time of trial was appointed unto the continual [sacrifice] by reason of transgression.) And it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised and prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that one who spoke, How long shall be the vision of the continual [sacrifice] and of the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden down under foot?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said unto me, Until two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings: then shall the sanctuary be vindicated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, when I Daniel had seen the vision, I sought for the understanding of it, and behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I heard a man's voice between [the banks of] the Ulai; and he called and said, Gabriel, make this [man] to understand the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face; and he said unto me, Understand, son of man; for the vision is for the time of the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now, as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep stupor, with my face toward the ground. And he touched me, and set me up where I had stood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be at the end of the indignation: for at the set time the end shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The ram that thou sawest having the two horns: they are the kings of Media and Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the rough goat is the king of Greece; and the great horn that was between his eyes is the first king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now that being broken, whereas four stood up in its stead, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And at the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors shall have come to the full, a king of bold countenance, and understanding riddles, shall stand up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy marvellously, and shall prosper, and shall practise, and shall destroy the mighty ones, and the people of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And through his cunning shall he cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he will magnify [himself] in his heart, and by prosperity will corrupt many; and he will stand up against the Prince of princes: but he shall be broken without hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the vision of the evening and the morning which hath been told is true; but close thou up the vision, for it is for many days [to come].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I Daniel fainted, and was sick [certain] days: then I rose up, and did the king's business. And I was astonished at the vision, but none understood [it].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
