  <div type='book' osisID='Acts'>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>I composed the first discourse, O Theophilus, concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>until that day in which, having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>to whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs; being seen by them during forty days, and speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>and, being assembled with [them], commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father, which [said he] ye have heard of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>For John indeed baptised with water, but *ye* shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit after now not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>They therefore, being come together, asked him saying, Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>And he said to them, It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>but ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>And having said these things he was taken up, they beholding [him], and a cloud received him out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>And as they were gazing into heaven, as he was going, behold, also two men stood by them in white clothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>who also said, Men of Galilee, why do ye stand looking into heaven? This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called [the mount] of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath-day's journey off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>And when they were come into [the city], they went up to the upper chamber, where were staying both Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James [son] of Alphaeus, and Simon the zealot, and Jude [the brother] of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer, with [several] women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>And in those days Peter, standing up in the midst of the brethren, said, (the crowd of names [who were] together [was] about a hundred and twenty,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>Brethren, it was necessary that the scripture should have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before, by the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who became guide to those who took Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>for he was numbered amongst us, and had received a part in this service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>(This [man] then indeed got a field with [the] reward of iniquity, and, having fallen down headlong, burst in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>And it was known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their own dialect Aceldama; that is, field of blood.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>For it is written in [the] book of Psalms, Let his homestead become desolate, and let there be no dweller in it; and, Let another take his overseership.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>It is necessary therefore, that of the men who have assembled with us all [the] time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us, one of these should be a witness with us of his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>And they appointed two, Joseph, who was called Barsabas, who had been surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>And they prayed, and said, Thou Lord, knower of the hearts of all, shew which one of these two thou hast chosen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>to receive the lot of this service and apostleship, from which Judas transgressing fell to go to his own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>And they gave lots on them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>And when the day of Pentecost was now accomplishing, they were all together in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>And there came suddenly a sound out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing, and filled all the house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>And there appeared to them parted tongues, as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>And they were all filled with [the] Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, pious men, from every nation of those under heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>But the rumour of this having spread, the multitude came together and were confounded, because each one heard them speaking in his own dialect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>And all were amazed and wondered, saying, Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galilaeans?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>and how do *we* hear [them] each in our own dialect in which we have been born,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and those who inhabit Mesopotamia, and Judaea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>both Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya which adjoin Cyrene, and the Romans sojourning [here], both Jews and proselytes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our own tongues the great things of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>And they were all amazed and in perplexity, saying one to another, What would this mean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>But others mocking said, They are full of new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth to them, Men of Judaea, and all ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give heed to my words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>for these are not full of wine, as *ye* suppose, for it is the third hour of the day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>but this is that which was spoken through the prophet Joel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>And it shall be in the last days, saith God, [that] I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your elders shall dream with dreams;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>yea, even upon my bondmen and upon my bondwomen in those days will I pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>And I will give wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>the sun shall be changed to darkness and the moon to blood, before the great and gloriously appearing day of [the] Lord come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>And it shall be that whosoever shall call upon the name of [the] Lord shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazaraean, a man borne witness to by God to you by works of power and wonders and signs, which God wrought by him in your midst, as yourselves know</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>him, given up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye, by [the] hand of lawless [men], have crucified and slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death, inasmuch as it was not possible that he should be held by its power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>for David says as to him, I foresaw the Lord continually before me, because he is at my right hand that I may not be moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>Therefore has my heart rejoiced and my tongue exulted; yea more, my flesh also shall dwell in hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>for thou wilt not leave my soul in hades, nor wilt thou give thy gracious one to see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>Thou hast made known to me [the] paths of life, thou wilt fill me with joy with thy countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>Brethren, let it be allowed to speak with freedom to you concerning the patriarch David, that he has both died and been buried, and his monument is amongst us unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath, of the fruit of his loins to set upon his throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>he, seeing [it] before, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither has he been left in hades nor his flesh seen corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>This Jesus has God raised up, whereof all *we* are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>For David has not ascended into the heavens, but he says himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>until I have put thine enemies [to be] the footstool of thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>Let the whole house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him, this Jesus whom *ye* have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>And having heard [it] they were pricked in heart, and said to Peter and the other apostles, What shall we do, brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>And Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who [are] afar off, as many as [the] Lord our God may call.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, Be saved from this perverse generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>Those then who had accepted his word were baptised; and there were added in that day about three thousand souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>And they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>And fear was upon every soul, and many wonders and signs took place through the apostles' means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>And all that believed were together, and had all things common,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>and sold their possessions and substance, and distributed them to all, according as any one might have need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>And every day, being constantly in the temple with one accord, and breaking bread in [the] house, they received their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>praising God, and having favour with all the people; and the Lord added [to the assembly] daily those that were to be saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>And Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, [which is] the ninth [hour];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>and a certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried, whom they placed every day at the gate of the temple called Beautiful, to ask alms of those who were going into the temple;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>who, seeing Peter and John about to enter into the temple, asked to receive alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>And Peter, looking stedfastly upon him with John, said, Look on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>But Peter said, Silver and gold I have not; but what I have, this give I to thee: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean rise up and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>And having taken hold of him [by] the right hand he raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones were made strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>And leaping up he stood and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>And all the people saw him walking and praising God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>and they recognised him, that it was *he* who sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico which is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>And Peter, seeing it, answered the people, Men of Israel, why are ye astonished at this? or why do ye gaze on us as if we had by our own power or piety made him to walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus, whom *ye* delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when *he* had judged that he should be let go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>But *ye* denied the holy and righteous one, and asked that a man [that was] a murderer should be granted to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>but the originator of life ye slew, whom God raised from among [the] dead, whereof *we* are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>And, by faith in his name, his name has made this [man] strong whom ye behold and know; and the faith which is by him has given him this complete soundness in the presence of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>And now, brethren, I know that ye did it in ignorance, as also your rulers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>but God has thus fulfilled what he had announced beforehand by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Repent therefore and be converted, for the blotting out of your sins, so that times of refreshing may come from [the] presence of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>and he may send Jesus Christ, who was foreordained for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>whom heaven indeed must receive till [the] times of [the] restoring of all things, of which God has spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets since time began.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>Moses indeed said, A prophet shall [the] Lord your God raise up to you out of your brethren like me: him shall ye hear in everything whatsoever he shall say to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>And it shall be that whatsoever soul shall not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>And indeed all the prophets from Samuel and those in succession after [him], as many as have spoken, have announced also these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>*Ye* are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God appointed to our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>To you first God, having raised up his servant, has sent him, blessing you in turning each one [of you] from your wickedness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>being distressed on account of their teaching the people and preaching by Jesus the resurrection from among [the] dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>and they laid hands on them, and put them in ward till the morrow; for it was already evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>But many of those who had heard the word believed; and the number of the men had become [about] five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>And it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together at Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of [the] high priestly family;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>and having placed them in the midst they inquired, In what power or in what name have *ye* done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter, filled with [the] Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders [of Israel],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>if *we* this day are called upon to answer as to the good deed [done] to the infirm man, how *he* has been healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean, whom *ye* have crucified, whom God has raised from among [the] dead, by *him* this [man] stands here before you sound [in body].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>*He* is the stone which has been set at nought by you the builders, which is become the corner stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>And salvation is in none other, for neither is there another name under heaven which is given among men by which we must be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>But seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and perceiving that they were unlettered and uninstructed men, they wondered; and they recognised them that they were with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>And beholding the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to reply;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>but having commanded them to go out of the council they conferred with one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed an evident sign has come to pass through their means is manifest to all that inhabit Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>But that it be not further spread among the people, let us threaten them severely no longer to speak to any man in this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>And having called them, they charged [them] not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John answering said to them, If it be righteous before God to listen to you rather than to God, judge ye;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>for as for us *we* cannot refrain from speaking of the things which we have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>But they, having further threatened them, let them go, finding no way how they might punish them, on account of the people, because all glorified God for what had taken place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>for the man on whom this sign of healing had taken place was above forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>And having been let go, they came to their own [company], and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>And they, having heard [it], lifted up [their] voice with one accord to God, and said, Lord, *thou* art the God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>who hast said by the mouth of thy servant David, Why have [the] nations raged haughtily and [the] peoples meditated vain things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings of the earth were there, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>For in truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with [the] nations, and peoples of Israel, have been gathered together in this city</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel had determined before should come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and give to thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.30'>in that thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and that signs and wonders take place through the name of thy holy servant Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>And the heart and soul of the multitude of those that had believed were one, and not one said that anything of what he possessed was his own, but all things were common to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>and with great power did the apostles give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>For neither was there any one in want among them; for as many as were owners of lands or houses, selling them, brought the price of what was sold</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>But a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit, and put aside for thyself a part of the price of the estate?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>While it remained did it not remain to *thee*? and sold, was [it not] in thine own power? Why is it that thou hast purposed this thing in thine heart? Thou hast not lied to men, but to God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.8'>And Peter answered her, Tell me if ye gave the estate for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.9'>And Peter said to her, Why [is it] that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of [the] Lord? Lo, the feet of those that have buried thy husband [are] at the door, and they shall carry thee out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.10'>And she fell down immediately at his feet and expired. And when the young men came in they found her dead; and, having carried her out, they buried her by her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>And great fear came upon all the assembly, and upon all who heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders done among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.13'>but of the rest durst no man join them, but the people magnified them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>and believers were more than ever added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>so that they brought out the sick into the streets and put [them] on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter, when he came, might overshadow some one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.16'>And the multitude also of the cities round about came together to Jerusalem, bringing sick persons and persons beset by unclean spirits, who were all healed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.19'>But an angel of [the] Lord during the night opened the doors of the prison, and leading them out, said,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>And when they heard it, they entered very early into the temple and taught. And when the high priest was come, and they that were with him, they called together the council and all the elderhood of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.22'>And when the officers were come, they did not find them in the prison; and returned and reported</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>saying, We found the prison shut with all security, and the keepers standing at the doors; but when we had opened [them], within we found no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>And when they heard these words, both the priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests were in perplexity as to them, what this would come to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>And some one coming reported to them, Lo, the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>Then the captain, having gone with the officers, brought them, not with violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.27'>And they bring them and set them in the council. And the high priest asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.28'>saying, We strictly enjoined you not to teach in this name: and lo, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and purpose to bring upon us the blood of this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>But Peter answering, and the apostles, said, God must be obeyed rather than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>The God of our fathers has raised up Jesus, whom *ye* have slain, having hanged on a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.31'>Him has God exalted by his right hand as leader and saviour, to give repentance to Israel and remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.32'>And *we* are [his] witnesses of these things, and the Holy Spirit also, which God has given to those that obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.33'>But they, when they heard [these things], were cut to the heart, and took counsel to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>But a certain [man], a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, held in honour of all the people, rose up in the council, and commanded to put the men out for a short while,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.35'>and said to them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves as regards these men what ye are going to do;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>for before these days Theudas rose up, alleging himself to be somebody, to whom a number of men, about four hundred, were joined; who was slain, and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed and came to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.37'>After him rose Judas the Galilean in the days of the census, and drew away [a number of] people after him; and *he* perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.38'>And now I say to you, Withdraw from these men and let them alone, for if this counsel or this work have its origin from men, it will be destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.39'>but if it be from God, ye will not be able to put them down, lest ye be found also fighters against God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.40'>And they listened to his advice; and having called the apostles, they beat them, and enjoined them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and dismissed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.41'>They therefore went their way from [the] presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be dishonoured for the name.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.8.36'>And as they went along the way, they came upon a certain water, and the eunuch says, Behold water; what hinders my being baptised?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.37'>Not available</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.38'>And he commanded the chariot to stop. And they went down both to the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptised him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.39'>But when they came up out of the water [the] Spirit of [the] Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no longer, for he went on his way rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.40'>And Philip was found at Azotus, and passing through he announced the glad tidings to all the cities till he came to Caesarea.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.1'>But Saul, still breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, came to the high priest</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.2'>and asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues, so that if he found any who were of the way, both men and women, he might bring [them] bound to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.3'>But as he was journeying, it came to pass that he drew near to Damascus; and suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.4'>and falling on the earth he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.5'>And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he [said], *I* am Jesus, whom *thou* persecutest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.6'>But rise up and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.7'>But the men who were travelling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but beholding no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>And Saul rose up from the earth, and his eyes being opened he saw no one. But leading [him] by the hand they brought him into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>And he was three days without seeing, and neither ate nor drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>And there was a certain disciple in Damascus by name Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, [here am] I, Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>And the Lord [said] to him, Rise up and go into the street which is called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas one by name Saul, [he is] of Tarsus: for, behold, he is praying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>and has seen [in a vision] a man by name Ananias coming in and putting his hand on him, so that he should see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many concerning this man how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon thy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>And the Lord said to him, Go, for this [man] is an elect vessel to me, to bear my name before both nations and kings and [the] sons of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>for *I* will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>And Ananias went and entered into the house; and laying his hands upon him he said, Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me, Jesus that appeared to thee in the way in which thou camest, that thou mightest see, and be filled with [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he saw, and rising up was baptised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>and, having received food, got strength. And he was with the disciples who [were] in Damascus certain days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>And straightway in the synagogues he preached Jesus that *he* is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>And all who heard were astonished and said, Is not this *he* who destroyed in Jerusalem those who called on this name, and here was come for this purpose, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>But Saul increased the more in power, and confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>Now when many days were fulfilled, the Jews consulted together to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>But their plot became known to Saul. And they watched also the gates both day and night, that they might kill him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>but the disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>And having arrived at Jerusalem he essayed to join himself to the disciples, and all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. And he spoke and discussed with the Hellenists; but they sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.30'>And the brethren knowing it, brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>Now it came to pass that Peter, passing through all [quarters], descended also to the saints who inhabited Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>And he found there a certain man, Aeneas by name, who had been lying for eight years upon a couch, who was paralysed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus, the Christ, heals thee: rise up, and make thy couch for thyself. And straightway he rose up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>And all who inhabited Lydda and the Saron saw him, who turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>And in Joppa there was a certain female disciple, by name Tabitha, which being interpreted means Dorcas. She was full of good works and alms-deeds which she did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.37'>And it came to pass in those days that she grew sick and died; and, having washed her, they put her in [the] upper room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>But Lydda being near to Joppa, the disciples having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, beseeching him, Thou must not delay coming to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>And Peter rising up went with them, whom, when arrived, they brought up into the upper chamber; and all the widows stood by him weeping and shewing him the body-coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>But Peter, putting them all out, and kneeling down, prayed. And, turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and, seeing Peter, sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>And having given her [his] hand, he raised her up, and having called the saints and the widows, presented her living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>And it became known throughout the whole of Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.43'>And it came to pass that he remained many days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>But a certain man in Caesarea, by name Cornelius, a centurion of the band called Italic,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>pious, and fearing God with all his house, [both] giving much alms to the people, and supplicating God continually,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>saw plainly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming unto him, and saying to him, Cornelius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>But he, having fixed his eyes upon him, and become full of fear, said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thine alms have gone up for a memorial before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>And now send men to Joppa and fetch Simon, who is surnamed Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>He lodges with a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>And when the angel who was speaking to him had departed, having called two of his household and a pious soldier of those who were constantly with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>and related all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>And on the morrow, as these were journeying and drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the house to pray, about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>And he became hungry and desired to eat. But as they were making ready an ecstasy came upon him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>and he beholds the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as a great sheet, [bound] by [the] four corners [and] let down to the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>in which were all the quadrupeds and creeping things of the earth, and the fowls of the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>And there was a voice to him, Rise, Peter, slay and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>And Peter said, In no wise, Lord; for I have never eaten anything common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>And [there was] a voice again the second time to him, What God has cleansed, do not *thou* make common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>And this took place thrice, and the vessel was straightway taken up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>And as Peter doubted in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold also the men who were sent by Cornelius, having sought out the house of Simon, stood at the gate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>and having called [some one], they inquired if Simon who was surnamed Peter was lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>But as Peter continued pondering over the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>but rise up, go down, and go with them, nothing doubting, because *I* have sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>And Peter going down to the men said, Behold, *I* am he whom ye seek: what is the cause for which ye come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>And they said, Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man, and fearing God, and borne witness to by the whole nation of the Jews, has been divinely instructed by a holy angel to send for thee to his house, and hear words from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>Having therefore invited them in, he lodged them. And on the morrow, rising up he went away with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>And on the morrow they came to Caesarea. But Cornelius was looking for them, having called together his kinsmen and [his] intimate friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>And when Peter was now coming in, Cornelius met him, and falling down did [him] homage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>But Peter made him rise, saying, Rise up: *I* myself also am a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>And he went in, talking with him, and found many gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>And he said to them, *Ye* know how it is unlawful for a Jew to be joined or come to one of a strange race, and to *me* God has shewn to call no man common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>Wherefore also, having been sent for, I came without saying anything against it. I inquire therefore for what reason ye have sent for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I had been [fasting] unto this hour, and the ninth [I was] praying in my house, and lo, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>and said, Cornelius, thy prayer has been heard, and thy alms have come in remembrance before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>Send therefore to Joppa and fetch Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodges in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea [who when he is come will speak to thee].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and *thou* hast well done in coming. Now therefore *we* are all present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>And Peter opening his mouth said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>but in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, (*he* is Lord of all things,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>*ye* know; the testimony which has spread through the whole of Judaea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>Jesus who [was] of Nazareth: how God anointed him with [the] Holy Spirit and with power; who went through [all quarters] doing good, and healing all that were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>*We* also [are] witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom they also slew, having hanged him on a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>This [man] God raised up the third day and gave him to be openly seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>not of all the people, but of witnesses who were chosen before of God, *us* who have eaten and drunk with him after he arose from among [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that *he* it is who was determinately appointed of God [to be] judge of living and dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>To him all the prophets bear witness that every one that believes on him will receive through his name remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter was yet speaking these words the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were hearing the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>And the faithful of the circumcision were astonished, as many as came with Peter, that upon the nations also the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>for they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter answered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>Can any one forbid water that these should not be baptised, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also [did]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>And he commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord. Then they begged him to stay some days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>And the apostles and the brethren who were in Judaea heard that the nations also had received the word of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>and when Peter went up to Jerusalem, they of the circumcision contended with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and hast eaten with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>But Peter began and set forth [the matter] to them in order, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in an ecstasy I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending like a great sheet, let down by four corners out of heaven, and it came even to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>on which having fixed mine eyes, I considered, and saw the quadrupeds of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the fowls of the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>And I heard also a voice saying to me, Rise up, Peter, slay and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>And I said, In no wise, Lord, for common or unclean has never entered into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>And a voice answered the second time out of heaven, What God has cleansed, do not *thou* make common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>And this took place thrice, and again all was drawn up into heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>and lo, immediately three men were at the house in which I was, sent to me from Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>And the Spirit said to me to go with them, nothing doubting. And there went with me these six brethren also, and we entered into the house of the man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>and he related to us how he had seen the angel in his house, standing and saying [to him], Send [men] to Joppa and fetch Simon, who is surnamed Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.14'>who shall speak words to thee whereby *thou* shalt be saved, thou and all thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them even as upon us also at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John baptised with water, but *ye* shall be baptised with [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>If then God has given them the same gift as also to us when we had believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who indeed was *I* to be able to forbid God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>And when they heard these things they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then indeed God has to the nations also granted repentance to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>They then who had been scattered abroad through the tribulation that took place on the occasion of Stephen, passed through [the country] to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one but to Jews alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>But there were certain of them, Cyprians and Cyrenians, who entering into Antioch spoke to the Greeks also, announcing the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>And [the] Lord's hand was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>And the report concerning them reached the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go through as far as Antioch:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>who, having arrived and seeing the grace of God, rejoiced, and exhorted all with purpose of heart to abide with the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>for he was a good man and full of [the] Holy Spirit and of faith; and a large crowd [of people] were added to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>And he went away to Tarsus to seek out Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>And having found [him], he brought him to Antioch. And so it was with them that for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly and taught a large crowd: and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>Now in these days prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>and one from among them, by name Agabus, rose up and signified by the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine over all the inhabited earth, which also came to pass under Claudius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>And they determined, according as any one of the disciples was well off, each of them to send to the brethren who dwelt in Judaea, to minister [to them];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.30'>which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.12'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.1'>At that time Herod the king laid his hands on some of those of the assembly to do them hurt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>and slew James, the brother of John, with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>And seeing that it was pleasing to the Jews, he went on to take Peter also: (and they were the days of unleavened bread:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>whom having seized he put in prison, having delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep, purposing after the passover to bring him out to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>Peter therefore was kept in the prison; but unceasing prayer was made by the assembly to God concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>And when Herod was going to bring him forth, that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards before the door kept the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>And lo, an angel of [the] Lord came there, and a light shone in the prison: and having smitten the side of Peter, he roused him up, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>And the angel said to him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he says to him, Cast thine upper garment about thee and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>And going forth he followed [him] and did not know that what was happening by means of the angel was real, but supposed he saw a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>And having passed through a first and second guard, they came to the iron gate which leads into the city, which opened to them of itself; and going forth they went down one street, and immediately the angel left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>And Peter, being come to himself, said, Now I know certainly that [the] Lord has sent forth his angel and has taken me out of the hand of Herod and all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>And having become clearly conscious [in himself], he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was surnamed Mark, where were many gathered together and praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>And when he had knocked at the door of the entry, a maid came to listen, by name Rhoda;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>and having recognised the voice of Peter, through joy did not open the entry, but running in, reported that Peter was standing before the entry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>And they said to her, Thou art mad. But she maintained that it was so. And they said, It is his angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>But Peter continued knocking: and having opened, they saw him and were astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>And having made a sign to them with his hand to be silent, he related [to them] how the Lord had brought him out of prison; and he said, Report these things to James and to the brethren. And he went out and went to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>And when it was day there was no small disturbance among the soldiers, what then was become of Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>And Herod having sought him and not found him, having examined the guards, commanded [them] to be executed. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea and stayed [there].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>And he was in bitter hostility with [the] Tyrians and Sidonians; but they came to him with one accord, and, having gained Blastus the king's chamberlain, sought peace, because their country was nourished by the king's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>And on a set day, clothed in royal apparel and sitting on the elevated seat [of honour], Herod made a public oration to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>And the people cried out, A god's voice and not a man's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.23'>And immediately an angel of [the] Lord smote him, because he did not give the glory to God, and he expired, eaten of worms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.24'>But the word of God grew and spread itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.25'>And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having fulfilled the service [entrusted to them], taking also with them John, surnamed Mark.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.13'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.1'>Now there were in Antioch, in the assembly which was [there], prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.2'>And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.3'>Then, having fasted and prayed, and having laid [their] hands on them, they let [them] go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.4'>They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and thence sailed away to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.5'>And being in Salamis, they announced the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John also as [their] attendant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.6'>And having passed through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain man a magician, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.7'>who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. *He*, having called Barnabas and Saul to [him], desired to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.8'>But Elymas the magician (for so his name is by interpretation) opposed them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.9'>But Saul, who also [is] Paul, filled with [the] Holy Spirit, fixing his eyes upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.10'>said, O full of all deceit and all craft: son of [the] devil, enemy of all righteousness; wilt thou not cease perverting the right paths of [the] Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.11'>And now behold, [the] Lord's hand [is] upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell upon him a mist and darkness; and going about he sought persons who should lead him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.12'>Then the proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.13'>And having sailed from Paphos, Paul and his company came to Perga of Pamphylia; and John separated from them and returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.14'>But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia; and entering into the synagogue on the sabbath day they sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.15'>And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation to the people, speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.16'>And Paul, rising up and making a sign with the hand, said, Israelites, and ye that fear God, hearken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.17'>The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people in their sojourn in [the] land of Egypt, and with a high arm brought them out of it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.18'>and for a time of about forty years he nursed them in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.19'>And having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.20'>And after these things he gave [them] judges till Samuel the prophet, [to the end of] about four hundred and fifty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.21'>And then they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul, son of Kis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, during forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.22'>And having removed him he raised up to them David for king, of whom also bearing witness he said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who shall do all my will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.23'>Of this man's seed according to promise has God brought to Israel a Saviour, Jesus;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.25'>And as John was fulfilling his course he said, Whom do ye suppose that I am? *I* am not [he]. But behold, there comes one after me, the sandal of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.26'>Brethren, sons of Abraham's race, and those who among you fear God, to you has the word of this salvation been sent:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.27'>for those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, not having known him, have fulfilled also the voices of the prophets which are read on every sabbath, [by] judging [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.28'>And having found no cause of death [in him], they begged of Pilate that he might be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.29'>And when they had fulfilled all things written concerning him, they took him down from the cross and put him in a sepulchre;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.30'>but God raised him from among [the] dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.31'>who appeared for many days to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.32'>And *we* declare unto you the glad tidings of the promise made to the fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.33'>that God has fulfilled this to us their children, having raised up Jesus; as it is also written in the second psalm, *Thou* art my Son: this day have *I* begotten thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.34'>But that he raised him from among [the] dead, no more to return to corruption, he spoke thus: I will give to you the faithful mercies of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.35'>Wherefore also he says in another, Thou wilt not suffer thy gracious one to see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.36'>For David indeed, having in his own generation ministered to the will of God, fell asleep, and was added to his fathers and saw corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.37'>But he whom God raised up did not see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.38'>Be it known unto you, therefore, brethren, that through this man remission of sins is preached to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.39'>and from all things from which ye could not be justified in the law of Moses, in him every one that believes is justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.40'>See therefore that that which is spoken in the prophets do not come upon [you],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.41'>Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish; for *I* work a work in your days, a work which ye will in no wise believe if one declare it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.42'>And as they went out they begged that these words might be spoken to them the ensuing sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.43'>And the congregation of the synagogue having broken up, many of the Jews and of the worshipping proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.44'>And on the coming sabbath almost all the city was gathered together to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.45'>But the Jews, seeing the crowds, were filled with envy, and contradicted the things said by Paul, [contradicting and] speaking injuriously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.46'>And Paul and Barnabas spoke boldly and said, It was necessary that the word of God should be first spoken to you; but, since ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the nations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.47'>for thus has the Lord enjoined us: I have set thee for a light of the nations, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.48'>And [those of] the nations, hearing it, rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord, and believed, as many as were ordained to eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.49'>And the word of the Lord was carried through the whole country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.50'>But the Jews excited the women of the upper classes who were worshippers, and the first people of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their coasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.51'>But they, having shaken off the dust of their feet against them, came to Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.52'>And the disciples were filled with joy and [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.1'>And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.2'>But the Jews who did not believe stirred up the minds of [those of] the nations and made [them] evil-affected against the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.3'>They stayed therefore a good while, speaking boldly, [confiding] in the Lord, who gave witness to the word of his grace, giving signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.4'>And the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews and some with the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.5'>And when an assault was making, both of [those of] the nations and [the] Jews with their rulers, to use [them] ill and stone them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.6'>they, being aware of it, fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding country,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.7'>and there they were announcing the glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.8'>And a certain man in Lystra, impotent in his feet, sat, [being] lame from his mother's womb, who had never walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.9'>This [man] heard Paul speaking, who, fixing his eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.10'>said with a loud voice, Rise up straight upon thy feet: and he sprang up and walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>But the crowds, who saw what Paul had done, lifted up their voices in Lycaonian, saying, The gods, having made themselves like men, are come down to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.12'>And they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury, because he took the lead in speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.13'>And the priest of Jupiter who was before the city, having brought bulls and garlands to the gates, would have done sacrifice along with the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.14'>But the apostles Barnabas and Paul, having heard [it], rent their garments, and rushed out to the crowd, crying</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.15'>and saying, Men, why do ye these things? *We* also are men of like passions with you, preaching to you to turn from these vanities to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things in them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.16'>who in the past generations suffered all the nations to go in their own ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.17'>though indeed he did not leave himself without witness, doing good, and giving to you from heaven rain and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.18'>And saying these things, they with difficulty kept the crowds from sacrificing to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.19'>But there came Jews from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds and stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing him to have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.20'>But while the disciples encircled him, he rose up and entered into the city. And on the morrow he went away with Barnabas to Derbe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.21'>And having announced the glad tidings to that city, and having made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.26'>and thence they sailed away to Antioch, whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.27'>And having arrived, and having brought together the assembly, they related to them all that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.1'>And certain persons, having come down from Judaea, taught the brethren, If ye shall not have been circumcised according to the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.2'>A commotion therefore having taken place, and no small discussion on the part of Paul and Barnabas against them, they arranged that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others from amongst them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.3'>They therefore, having been set on their way by the assembly, passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of [those of] the nations. And they caused great joy to all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.4'>And being arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the assembly, and the apostles, and the elders, and related all that God had wrought with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.5'>And some of those who were of the sect of the Pharisees, who believed, rose up from among [them], saying that they ought to circumcise them and enjoin them to keep the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.6'>And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>And much discussion having taken place, Peter, standing up, said to them, Brethren, *ye* know that from the earliest days God amongst you chose that the nations by my mouth should hear the word of the glad tidings and believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.8'>And the heart-knowing God bore them witness, giving [them] the Holy Spirit as to us also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.9'>and put no difference between us and them, having purified their hearts by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.10'>Now therefore why tempt ye God, by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.11'>But we believe that we shall be saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same manner as they also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.12'>And all the multitude kept silence and listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders which God had wrought among the nations by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.13'>And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, listen to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.14'>Simon has related how God first visited to take out of [the] nations a people for his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.15'>And with this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.16'>After these things I will return, and will rebuild the tabernacle of David which is fallen, and will rebuild its ruins, and will set it up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.17'>so that the residue of men may seek out the Lord, and all the nations on whom my name is invoked, saith [the] Lord, who does these things</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.18'>known from eternity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.19'>Wherefore *I* judge, not to trouble those who from the nations turn to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.20'>but to write to them to abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.21'>For Moses, from generations of old, has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.22'>Then it seemed good to the apostles and to the elders, with the whole assembly, to send chosen men from among them with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch, Judas called Barsabas and Silas, leading men among the brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.23'>having by their hand written [thus]: The apostles, and the elders, and the brethren, to the brethren who are from among [the] nations at Antioch, and [in] Syria and Cilicia, greeting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.24'>Inasmuch as we have heard that some who went out from amongst us have troubled you by words, upsetting your souls, [saying that ye must be circumcised and keep the law]; to whom we gave no commandment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.25'>it seemed good to us, having arrived at a common judgment, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.26'>men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves also will tell you by word [of mouth] the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.28'>For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.29'>to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication; keeping yourselves from which ye will do well. Farewell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.30'>They therefore, being let go, came to Antioch, and having gathered the multitude delivered to [them] the epistle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.31'>And having read it, they rejoiced at the consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.32'>And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with much discourse, and strengthened them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.33'>And having passed some time [there], they were let go in peace from the brethren to those who sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.34'>Not available</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.35'>And Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and announcing the glad tidings, with many others also, of the word of the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.37'>And Barnabas proposed to take with [them] John also, called Mark;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.38'>but Paul thought it not well to take with them him who had abandoned them, [going back] from Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.39'>There arose therefore very warm feeling, so that they separated from one another; and Barnabas taking Mark sailed away to Cyprus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.40'>but Paul having chosen Silas went forth, committed by the brethren to the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.41'>And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the assemblies.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>And he came to Derbe and Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, by name Timotheus, son of a Jewish believing woman, but [the] father a Greek,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Him would Paul have go forth with him, and took [him and] circumcised him on account of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew his father that he was a Greek.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>and having passed by Mysia they descended to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a certain Macedonian man, standing and beseeching him, and saying, Pass over into Macedonia and help us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>And the crowd rose up too against them; and the praetors, having torn off their clothes, commanded to scourge [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>And having laid many stripes upon them they cast [them] into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and secured their feet to the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>And at midnight Paul and Silas, in praying, were praising God with singing, and the prisoners listened to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison shook, and all the doors were immediately opened, and the bonds of all loosed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.28'>But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm, for we are all here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>And having asked for lights, he rushed in, and, trembling, fell down before Paul and Silas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>And leading them out said, Sirs, what must I do that I may be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, with all that were in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>And he took them the same hour of the night and washed [them] from their stripes; and was baptised, he and all his straightway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>And having brought them into his house he laid the table [for them], and rejoiced with all his house, having believed in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>And when it was day, the praetors sent the lictors, saying, Let those men go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>And the jailor reported these words to Paul: The praetors have sent that ye may be let go. Now therefore go out and depart in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly uncondemned, us who are Romans, they have cast us into prison, and now they thrust us out secretly? no, indeed, but let them come themselves and bring us out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>And the lictors reported these words to the praetors. And they were afraid when they heard they were Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>And they came and besought them, and having brought them out, asked them to go out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>And having gone out of the prison, they came to Lydia; and having seen the brethren, they exhorted them and went away.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>And having journeyed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was the synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>And according to Paul's custom he went in among them, and on three sabbaths reasoned with them from the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>opening and laying down that the Christ must have suffered and risen up from among the dead, and that this is the Christ, Jesus whom *I* announce to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>And some of them believed, and joined themselves to Paul and Silas, and of the Greeks who worshipped, a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But the Jews having been stirred up to jealousy, and taken to [themselves] certain wicked men of the lowest rabble, and having got a crowd together, set the city in confusion; and having beset the house of Jason sought to bring them out to the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>and not having found them, dragged Jason and certain brethren before the politarchs, crying out, These [men] that have set the world in tumult, are come here also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>whom Jason has received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying, that there is another king, Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>And they troubled the crowd and the politarchs when they heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>And having taken security of Jason and the rest, they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>But the brethren immediately sent away, in the night, Paul and Silas to Berea; who, being arrived, went away into the synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>And these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, receiving the word with all readiness of mind, daily searching the scriptures if these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>Therefore many from among them believed, and of Grecian women of the upper classes and men not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>But when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the word of God was announced in Berea also by Paul, they came there also, stirring up the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as to the sea; but Silas and Timotheus abode there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>But they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and, having received a commandment to Silas and Timotheus, that they should come to him as quickly as possible, they departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>But in Athens, while Paul was waiting for them, his spirit was painfully excited in him seeing the city given up to idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>He reasoned therefore in the synagogue with the Jews, and those who worshipped, and in the market-place every day with those he met with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>But some also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers attacked him. And some said, What would this chatterer say? and some, He seems to be an announcer of foreign demons, because he announced the glad tidings of Jesus and the resurrection [to them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>And having taken hold on him they brought [him] to Areopagus, saying, Might we know what this new doctrine which is spoken by thee [is]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears. We wish therefore to know what these things may mean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>Now all [the] Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else than to tell and to hear the news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>And Paul standing in the midst of Areopagus said, Athenians, in every way I see you given up to demon worship;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>for, passing through and beholding your shrines, I found also an altar on which was inscribed, To the unknown God. Whom therefore ye reverence, not knowing [him], him I announce to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>The God who has made the world and all things which are in it, *he*, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>nor is served by men's hands as needing something, himself giving to all life and breath and all things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>and has made of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, having determined ordained times and the boundaries of their dwelling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>that they may seek God; if indeed they might feel after him and find him, although he is not far from each one of us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>for in him we live and move and exist; as also some of the poets amongst you have said, For we are also his offspring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>Being therefore [the] offspring of God, we ought not to think that which is divine to be like gold or silver or stone, [the] graven form of man's art and imagination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>God therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, now enjoins men that they shall all everywhere repent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>because he has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by [the] man whom he has appointed, giving the proof [of it] to all [in] having raised him from among [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>And when they heard [of the] resurrection of the dead, some mocked, and some said, We will hear thee again also concerning this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>Thus Paul went out of their midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>But some men joining themselves to him believed; among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman by name Damaris, and others with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>And after these things, having left Athens, he came to Corinth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>and finding a certain Jew by name Aquila, of Pontus by race, just come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife, (because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome,) came to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>and because they were of the same trade abode with them, and wrought. For they were tent-makers by trade.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in respect of the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>But as they opposed and spoke injuriously, he shook his clothes, and said to them, Your blood be upon your own head: *I* [am] pure; from henceforth I will go to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>And departing thence he came to the house of a certain [man], by name Justus, who worshipped God, whose house adjoined the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>But Crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>And the Lord said by vision in [the] night to Paul, Fear not, but speak and be not silent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>because *I* am with thee, and no one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>And he remained [there] a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one consent rose against Paul and led him to the judgment-seat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>saying, This [man] persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>But as Paul was going to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If indeed it was some wrong or wicked criminality, O Jews, of reason I should have borne with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>but if it be questions about words, and names, and the law that ye have, see to it yourselves; [for] *I* do not intend to be judge of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>And he drove them from the judgment-seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>And having all laid hold on Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, they beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio troubled himself about none of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>And Paul, having yet stayed [there] many days, took leave of the brethren and sailed thence to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>and he arrived at Ephesus, and left them there. But entering himself into the synagogue he reasoned with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>And when they asked him that he would remain for a longer time [with them] he did not accede,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>but bade them farewell, saying, [I must by all means keep the coming feast at Jerusalem]; I will return to you again, if God will: and he sailed away from Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>And landing at Caesarea, and having gone up and saluted the assembly, he went down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>And having stayed [there] some time, he went forth, passing in order through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, establishing all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>But a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, who was mighty in the scriptures, arrived at Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>He was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in his spirit, he spoke and taught exactly the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>And *he* began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla, having heard him, took him to [them] and unfolded to him the way of God more exactly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>And when he purposed to go into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples engaging them to receive him, who, being come, contributed much to those who believed through grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>For he with great force convinced the Jews publicly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>And it came to pass, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper districts, came to Ephesus, and finding certain disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>he said to them, Did ye receive [the] Holy Spirit when ye had believed? And they [said] to him, We did not even hear if [the] Holy Spirit was [come].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>And he said, To what then were ye baptised? And they said, To the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>And Paul said, John indeed baptised [with] the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on him that was coming after him, that is, on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>And when they heard that, they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>And Paul having laid [his] hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>And all the men were about twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly during three months, reasoning and persuading [the things] concerning the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>But when some were hardened and disbelieved, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, he left them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>And this took place for two years, so that all that inhabited Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>And God wrought no ordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>so that even napkins or aprons were brought from his body [and put] upon the sick, and the diseases left them, and the wicked spirits went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>And certain of the Jewish exorcists also, who went about, took in hand to call upon those who had wicked spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>And there were certain [men], seven sons of Sceva, Jewish high priest, who were doing this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>But the wicked spirit answering said to them, Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with; but *ye*, who are ye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>And the man in whom the wicked spirit was leaped upon them, and having mastered both, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who inhabited Ephesus, and fear fell upon all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>And many of those that believed came confessing and declaring their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>And many of those that practised curious arts brought their books [of charms] and burnt them before all. And they reckoned up the prices of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>Thus with might the word of the Lord increased and prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>And when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in his spirit to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, After I have been there I must see Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>And having sent into Macedonia two of those ministering to him, Timotheus and Erastus, he remained himself awhile in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>And there took place at that time no small disturbance about the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>For a certain [man] by name Demetrius, a silver-beater, making silver temples of Artemis, brought no small gain to the artisans;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>whom having brought together, and those who wrought in such things, he said, Men, ye know that our well-living arises from this work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>and ye see and hear that this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great crowd, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, saying that they are no gods which are made with hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>Now not only there is danger for us that our business come into discredit, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be counted for nothing, and that her greatness should be destroyed whom the whole of Asia and the world reveres.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>And having heard [this], and being filled with rage, they cried out, saying, Great [is] Artemis of the Ephesians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>And the [whole] city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord to the theatre, having seized and carried off with [them] Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, fellow-travellers of Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>But Paul intending to go in to the people, the disciples suffered him not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>and some of the Asiarchs also, who were his friends, sent to him and urged him not to throw himself into the theatre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>Different persons therefore cried out some different thing; for the assembly was tumultuous, and the most did not know for what cause they had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>But from among the crowd they put forward Alexander, the Jews pushing him forward. And Alexander, beckoning with his hand, would have made a defence to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>But, recognising that he was a Jew, there was one cry from all, shouting for about two hours, Great [is] Artemis of the Ephesians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>And the townclerk, having quieted the crowd, said, Ephesians, what man is there then who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of Artemis the great, and of the [image] which fell down from heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>These things therefore being undeniable, it is necessary that ye should be calm and do nothing headlong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>For ye have brought these men, [who are] neither temple-plunderers, nor speak injuriously of your goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>If therefore Demetrius and the artisans who [are] with him have a matter against any one, the courts are being held, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>But if ye inquire anything concerning other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>For also we are in danger to be put in accusation for sedition for this [affair] of to-day, no cause existing in reference to which we shall be able to give a reason for this concourse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.41'>And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>But after the tumult had ceased, Paul having called the disciples to [him] and embraced [them], went away to go to Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>And having passed through those parts, and having exhorted them with much discourse, he came to Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>And having spent three months [there], a treacherous plot against him having been set on foot by the Jews, as he was going to sail to Syria, [the] resolution was adopted of returning through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater [son] of Pyrrhus, a Berean; and of Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius and Timotheus of Derbe, and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>These going before waited for us in Troas;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and we came to them to Troas in five days, where we spent seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>And the first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread, Paul discoursed to them, about to depart on the morrow. And he prolonged the discourse till midnight.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>And a certain youth, by name Eutychus, sitting at the window-opening, overpowered by deep sleep, while Paul discoursed very much at length, having been overpowered by the sleep, fell from the third story down to the bottom, and was taken up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>But Paul descending fell upon him, and enfolding [him] [in his arms], said, Be not troubled, for his life is in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>And having gone up, and having broken the bread, and eaten, and having long spoken until daybreak, so he went away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>And we, having gone before on board ship, sailed off to Assos, going to take in Paul there; for so he had directed, he himself being about to go on foot.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>and having sailed thence, on the morrow arrived opposite Chios, and the next day put in at Samos; and having stayed at Trogyllium, the next day we came to Miletus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>for Paul thought it desirable to sail by Ephesus, so that he might not be made to spend time in Asia; for he hastened, if it was possible for him, to be the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>But from Miletus having sent to Ephesus, he called over [to him] the elders of the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>And when they were come to him, he said to them, *Ye* know how I was with you all the time from the first day that I arrived in Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>serving the Lord with all lowliness, and tears, and temptations, which happened to me through the plots of the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>how I held back nothing of what is profitable, so as not to announce [it] to you, and to teach you publicly and in every house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>testifying to both Jews and Greeks repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>And now, behold, bound in my spirit *I* go to Jerusalem, not knowing what things shall happen to me in it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.23'>only that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and tribulations await me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But I make no account of [my] life [as] dear to myself, so that I finish my course, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the glad tidings of the grace of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>And they all wept sore; and falling upon the neck of Paul they ardently kissed him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.21.1'>And when, having got away from them, we at last sailed away, we came by a direct course to Cos, and on the morrow to Rhodes, and thence to Patara.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.2'>And having found a ship passing over into Phoenicia, we went on board and sailed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.3'>and having sighted Cyprus, and left it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and made the land at Tyre, for there the ship was to discharge her cargo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.4'>And having found out the disciples, we remained there seven days; who said to Paul by the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.5'>But when we had completed the days, we set out and took our journey, all of them accompanying us, with wives and children, till [we were] out of the city. And kneeling down upon the shore we prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.6'>And having embraced one another, we went on board ship, and they returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.7'>And we, having completed the voyage, arrived from Tyre at Ptolemais, and having saluted the brethren, we remained one day with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.8'>And leaving on the morrow, we came to Caesarea; and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was of the seven, we abode with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.9'>Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.10'>And as we stayed there many days, a certain man, by name Agabus, a prophet, came down from Judaea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.11'>and coming to us and taking the girdle of Paul, and having bound his own hands and feet, said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, The man whose this girdle is shall the Jews thus bind in Jerusalem, and deliver him up into the hands of [the] Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.12'>And when we heard these things, both we and those of the place besought [him] not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.13'>But Paul answered, What do ye, weeping and breaking my heart? for *I* am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>And when he would not be persuaded, we were silent, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>And after these days, having got our effects ready, we went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>And [some] of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing [with them] a certain Mnason, a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we were to lodge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.17'>And when we arrived at Jerusalem the brethren gladly received us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>And on the morrow Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders came there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>And having saluted them, he related one by one the things which God had wrought among the nations by his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>And they having heard [it] glorified God, and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many myriads there are of the Jews who have believed, and all are zealous of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>And they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews among the nations apostasy from Moses, saying that they should not circumcise their children, nor walk in the customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>What is it then? a multitude must necessarily come together, for they will hear that thou art come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>This do therefore that we say to thee: We have four men who have a vow on them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses, that they may have their heads shaved; and all will know that [of those things] of which they have been informed about thee nothing is [true]; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, keeping the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>But concerning [those of] the nations who have believed, we have written, deciding that they should [observe no such thing, only to] keep themselves both from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul, taking the men, on the next day, having been purified, entered with them into the temple, signifying the time the days of the purification would be fulfilled, until the offering was offered for every one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>And when the seven days were nearly completed, the Jews from Asia, having seen him in the temple, set all the crowd in a tumult, and laid hands upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>crying, Israelites, help! this is the man who teaches all everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place, and has brought Greeks too into the temple, and profaned this holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>For they had before seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>And the whole city was moved, and there was a concourse of the people; and having laid hold on Paul they drew him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>And as they were seeking to kill him, a representation came to the chiliarch of the band that the whole of Jerusalem was in a tumult;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>who, taking with him immediately soldiers and centurions, ran down upon them. But they, seeing the chiliarch and the soldiers, ceased beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>Then the chiliarch came up and laid hold upon him, and commanded [him] to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he might be, and what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>And different persons cried some different thing in the crowd. But he, not being able to know the certainty on account of the uproar, commanded him to be brought into the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>But when he got upon the stairs it was so that he was borne by the soldiers on account of the violence of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>For the multitude of the people followed, crying, Away with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>But as he was about to be led into the fortress, Paul says to the chiliarch, Is it allowed me to say something to thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>Thou art not then that Egyptian who before these days raised a sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the assassins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>But Paul said, *I* am a Jew of Tarsus, citizen of no insignificant city of Cilicia, and I beseech of thee, allow me to speak to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>And when he had allowed him, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people; and a great silence having been made, he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>Brethren and fathers, hear my defence which I now make to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>And hearing that he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more quiet; and he says,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>*I* am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, educated according to [the] exactness of the law of [our] fathers, being zealous for God, as *ye* are all this day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>who have persecuted this way unto death, binding and delivering up to prisons both men and women;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>as also the high priest bears me witness, and all the elderhood: from whom also, having received letters to the brethren, I went to Damascus to bring those also who were there, bound, to Jerusalem, to be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>And it came to pass, as I was journeying and drawing near to Damascus, that, about mid-day, there suddenly shone out of heaven a great light round about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>And *I* answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, *I* am Jesus the Nazaraean, whom *thou* persecutest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>But they that were with me beheld the light, [and were filled with fear], but heard not the voice of him that was speaking to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Rise up, and go to Damascus, and there it shall be told thee of all things which it is appointed thee to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>And as I could not see, through the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>And a certain Ananias, a pious man according to the law, borne witness to by all the Jews who dwelt [there],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>coming to me and standing by me, said to me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And *I*, in the same hour, received my sight and saw him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen thee beforehand to know his will, and to see the just one, and to hear a voice out of his mouth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>for thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what thou hast seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>And now why lingerest thou? Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away, calling on his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>And it came to pass when I had returned to Jerusalem, and as I was praying in the temple, that I became in ecstasy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>and saw him saying to me, Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>And *I* said, Lord, they themselves know that *I* was imprisoning and beating in every synagogue those that believe on thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>and when the blood of thy witness Stephen was shed, I also myself was standing by and consenting, and kept the clothes of them who killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>And he said to me, Go, for *I* will send thee to the nations afar off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>And they heard him until this word, and lifted up their voice, saying, Away with such a one as that from the earth, for it was not fit he should live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>And as they were crying, and throwing away their clothes, and casting dust into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the chiliarch commanded him to be brought into the fortress, saying that he should be examined by scourging, that he might ascertain for what cause they cried thus against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>But as they stretched him forward with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood [by], Is it lawful for you to scourge a man [who is] a Roman and uncondemned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>And the centurion, having heard it, went and reported it to the chiliarch, saying, What art thou going to do? for this man is a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>And the chiliarch coming up said to him, Tell me, Art *thou* a Roman? And he said, Yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>And the chiliarch answered, *I*, for a great sum, bought this citizenship. And Paul said, But *I* was also [free] born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>Immediately therefore those who were going to examine him left him, and the chiliarch also was afraid when he ascertained that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>And on the morrow, desirous to know the certainty [of the matter] why he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and having brought Paul down set him before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>And Paul, fixing his eyes on the council, said, Brethren, I have walked in all good conscience with God unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>But the high priest Ananias ordered those standing by him to smite his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>Then Paul said to him, God will smite thee, whited wall. And *thou*, dost thou sit judging me according to the law, and breaking the law commandest me to be smitten?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>And those that stood by said, Dost thou rail against the high priest of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>And Paul said, I was not conscious, brethren, that he was high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evilly of the ruler of thy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>But Paul, knowing that the one part [of them] were of the Sadducees and the other of the Pharisees, cried out in the council, Brethren, *I* am a Pharisee, son of Pharisees: *I* am judged concerning the hope and resurrection of [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>And when he had spoken this, there was a tumult of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For Sadducees say there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but Pharisees confess both of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>And there was a great clamour, and the scribes of the Pharisees' part rising up contended, saying, We find nothing evil in this man; and if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>And a great tumult having arisen, the chiliarch, fearing lest Paul should have been torn in pieces by them, commanded the troop to come down and take him by force from the midst of them, and to bring [him] into the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>But the following night the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good courage; for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so thou must bear witness at Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>And when it was day, the Jews, having banded together, put themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they should kill Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>And they were more than forty who had joined together in this oath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>and they went to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have cursed ourselves with a curse to taste nothing until we kill Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>Now therefore do ye with the council make a representation to the chiliarch so that he may bring him down to you, as about to determine more precisely what concerns him, and we, before he draws near, are ready to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>But Paul's sister's son, having heard of the lying in wait, came and entered into the fortress and reported [it] to Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>And Paul, having called one of the centurions, said, Take this youth to the chiliarch, for he has something to report to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>He therefore, having taken him with [him], led him to the chiliarch, and says, The prisoner Paul called me to [him] and asked me to lead this youth to thee, who has something to say to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>And the chiliarch having taken him by the hand, and having gone apart in private, inquired, What is it that thou hast to report to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>And he said, The Jews have agreed together to make a request to thee, that thou mayest bring Paul down to-morrow into the council, as about to inquire something more precise concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>Do not thou then be persuaded by them, for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have put themselves under a curse neither to eat nor drink till they kill him; and now they are ready waiting the promise from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>The chiliarch then dismissed the youth, commanding [him], Utter to no one that thou hast represented these things to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>And having called to [him] certain two of the centurions, he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers that they may go as far as Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred light-armed footmen, for the third hour of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>And [he ordered them] to provide beasts, that they might set Paul on them and carry [him] safe through to Felix the governor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>having written a letter, couched in this form:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix, greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>This man, having been taken by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them, I came up with the military and took out [of their hands], having learned that he was a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>And desiring to know the charge on which they accused him, I brought him down to their council;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>whom I found to be accused of questions of their law, but to have no charge laid against him [making him] worthy of death or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>But having received information of a plot about to be put in execution against the man [by the Jews], I have immediately sent him to thee, commanding also his accusers to say before thee the things that are against him. [Farewell.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>The soldiers therefore, according to what was ordered them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>and on the morrow, having left the horsemen to go with him, returned to the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>And these, having entered into Caesarea, and given up the letter to the governor, presented Paul also to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>And having read [it], and asked of what eparchy he was, and learned that [he was] of Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>he said, I will hear thee fully when thine accusers also are arrived. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's praetorium.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>And after five days came down the high priest Ananias, with the elders, and a certain orator called Tertullus, and laid their informations against Paul before the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>And he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse, saying, Seeing we enjoy great peace through thee, and that excellent measures are executed for this nation by thy forethought,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>we receive [it] always and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>But that I may not too much intrude on thy time, I beseech thee to hear us briefly in thy kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>For finding this man a pest, and moving sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a leader of the sect of the Nazaraeans;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>who also attempted to profane the temple; whom we also had seized, [and would have judged according to our law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>but Lysias, the chiliarch, coming up, took [him] away with great force out of our hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>having commanded his accusers to come to thee;] of whom thou canst thyself, in examining [him], know the certainty of all these things of which we accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>And the Jews also joined in pressing the matter against [Paul], saying that these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>But Paul, the governor having beckoned to him to speak, answered, Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge to this nation, I answer readily as to the things which concern myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>As thou mayest know that there are not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>and neither in the temple did they find me discoursing to any one, or making any tumultuous gathering together of the crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>neither can they make good the things of which they now accuse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>But this I avow to thee, that in the way which they call sect, so I serve my fathers' God, believing all things which are written throughout the law, and in the prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>having hope towards God, which they themselves also receive, that there is to be a resurrection both of just and unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>For this cause I also exercise [myself] to have in everything a conscience without offence towards God and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>And after a lapse of many years I arrived, bringing alms to my nation, and offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>Whereupon they found me purified in the temple, with neither crowd nor tumult. But it was certain Jews from Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>who ought to appear before thee and accuse, if they have anything against me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>or let these themselves say what wrong they found in me when I stood before the council,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>[other] than concerning this one voice which I cried standing amongst them: I am judged this day by you touching [the] resurrection of [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>And Felix, knowing accurately the things concerning the way, adjourned them, saying, When Lysias the chiliarch is come down I will determine your affair;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>ordering the centurion to keep him, and that he should have freedom, and to hinder none of his friends to minister to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>And after certain days, Felix having arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>And as he reasoned concerning righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment about to come, Felix, being filled with fear, answered, Go for the present, and when I get an opportunity I will send for thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>hoping at the same time that money would be given him by Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener and communed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>But when two years were completed, Felix was relieved by Porcius Festus as his successor; and Felix, desirous to oblige the Jews, to acquire their favour, left Paul bound.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Festus therefore, being come into the eparchy, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>And the chief priests and the chief of the Jews laid informations before him against Paul, and besought him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>asking as a grace against him that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying people in wait to kill him on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>Festus therefore answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to set out shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>Let therefore the persons of authority among you, says he, going down too, if there be anything in this man, accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>And having remained among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the next day, having sat down on the judgment-seat, commanded Paul to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>And when he was come, the Jews who were come down from Jerusalem stood round, bringing many and grievous charges which they were not able to prove:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>Paul answering for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I offended [in] anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>But Festus, desirous of obliging the Jews, to acquire their favour, answering Paul, said, Art thou willing to go up to Jerusalem, there to be judged before me concerning these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>But Paul said, I am standing before the judgment-seat of Caesar, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews have I done no wrong, as *thou* also very well knowest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>If then I have done any wrong and committed anything worthy of death, I do not deprecate dying; but if there is nothing of those things of which they accuse me, no man can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>Then Festus, having conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed to Caesar. To Caesar shalt thou go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>And when certain days had elapsed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to salute Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>And when they had spent many days there, Festus laid before the king the matters relating to Paul, saying, There is a certain man left prisoner by Felix,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>concerning whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid informations, requiring judgment against him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>to whom I answered, It is not [the] custom of the Romans to give up any man before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and he have got opportunity of defence touching the charge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>When therefore they had come together here, without putting it off, I sat the next day on the judgment-seat and commanded the man to be brought:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>concerning whom the accusers, standing up, brought no such accusation of guilt as *I* supposed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>but had against him certain questions of their own system of worship, and concerning a certain Jesus who is dead, whom Paul affirmed to be living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>And as I myself was at a loss as to an inquiry into these things, I said, Was he willing to go to Jerusalem and there to be judged concerning these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But Paul having appealed to be kept for the cognisance of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I shall send him to Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>And Agrippa [said] to Festus, I myself also would desire to hear the man. To-morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>On the morrow therefore, Agrippa being come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and having entered into the hall of audience, with the chiliarchs and the men of distinction of the city, and Festus having given command, Paul was brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye see this person, concerning whom all the multitude of the Jews applied to me both in Jerusalem and here, crying out against [him] that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>But I, having found that he had done nothing worthy of death, and this [man] himself having appealed to Augustus, I have decided to send him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>concerning whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord. Wherefore I have brought him before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, so that an examination having been gone into I may have something to write:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>for it seems to me senseless, sending a prisoner, not also to signify the charges against him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>And Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretching out his hand answered in his defence:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>I count myself happy, king Agrippa, in having to answer to-day before thee concerning all of which I am accused by the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>especially because thou art acquainted with all the customs and questions which are among the Jews; wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>My manner of life then from my youth, which from its commencement was passed among my nation in Jerusalem, know all the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>who knew me before from the outset [of my life], if they would bear witness, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>And now I stand to be judged because of the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>to which our whole twelve tribes serving incessantly day and night hope to arrive; about which hope, O king, I am accused of [the] Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>Why should it be judged a thing incredible in your sight if God raises the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>*I* indeed myself thought that I ought to do much against the name of Jesus the Nazaraean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>Which also I did in Jerusalem, and myself shut up in prisons many of the saints, having received the authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death I gave my vote.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>And often punishing them in all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme. And, being exceedingly furious against them, I persecuted them even to cities out [of our own land].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>And when, [engaged] in this, I was journeying to Damascus, with authority and power from the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>at mid-day, on the way, I saw, O king, a light above the brightness of the sun, shining from heaven round about me and those who were journeying with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>And, when we were all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? [it is] hard for thee to kick against goads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, *I* am Jesus whom *thou* persecutest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>but rise up and stand on thy feet; for, for this purpose have I appeared to thee, to appoint thee to be a servant and a witness both of what thou hast seen, and of what I shall appear to thee in,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>taking thee out from among the people, and the nations, to whom *I* send thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>but have, first to those both in Damascus and Jerusalem, and to all the region of Judaea, and to the nations, announced that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>On account of these things the Jews, having seized me in the temple, attempted to lay hands on and destroy me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>Having therefore met with [the] help which is from God, I have stood firm unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying nothing else than those things which both the prophets and Moses have said should happen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>[namely,] whether Christ should suffer; whether he first, through resurrection of [the] dead, should announce light both to the people and to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>And as he answered for his defence with these things, Festus says with a loud voice, Thou art mad, Paul; much learning turns thee to madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>But Paul said, I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but utter words of truth and soberness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>for the king is informed about these things, to whom also I speak with all freedom. For I am persuaded that of these things nothing is hidden from him; for this was not done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>And Agrippa [said] to Paul, In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>And Paul [said], I would to God, both in little and in much, that not only thou, but all who have heard me this day, should become such as *I* also am, except these bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>And the king stood up, and the governor and Bernice, and those who sat with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>and having gone apart, they spoke to one another saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been let go if he had not appealed to Caesar.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>But when it had been determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered up Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion, by name Julius, of Augustus' company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>And going on board a ship of Adramyttium about to navigate by the places along Asia, we set sail, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>And the next day we arrived at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and suffered him to go to his friends and refresh himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>And setting sail thence we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>And having sailed over the waters of Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to Myra in Lycia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy, he made us go on board her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>And sailing slowly for many days, and having with difficulty got abreast of Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete abreast of Salmone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>and coasting it with difficulty we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near to which was [the] city of Lasaea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>And much time having now been spent, and navigation being already dangerous, because the fast also was already past, Paul counselled them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>saying, Men, I perceive that the navigation will be with disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But the centurion believed rather the helmsman and the shipowner than what was said by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>And the harbour being ill adapted to winter in, the most counselled to set sail thence, if perhaps they might reach Phoenice to winter in, a port of Crete looking north-east and south-east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>And [the] south wind blowing gently, supposing that they had gained their object, having weighed anchor they sailed close in shore along Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But not long after there came down it a hurricane called Euroclydon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>And the ship being caught and driven, and not able to bring her head to the wind, letting her go we were driven [before it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>But running under the lee of a certain island called Clauda, we were with difficulty able to make ourselves masters of the boat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>which having hoisted up, they used helps, frapping the ship; and fearing lest they should run into Syrtis and run aground, and having lowered the gear they were so driven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>But the storm being extremely violent on us, on the next day they threw cargo overboard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>and on the third day with their own hands they cast away the ship furniture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>And neither sun nor stars appearing for many days, and no small storm lying on us, in the end all hope of our being saved was taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>And when they had been a long while without taking food, Paul then standing up in the midst of them said, Ye ought, O men, to have hearkened to me, and not have made sail from Crete and have gained this disaster and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>And now I exhort you to be of good courage, for there shall be no loss at all of life of [any] of you, only of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>For an angel of the God, whose I am and whom I serve, stood by me this night,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted to thee all those that sail with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>Wherefore be of good courage, men, for I believe God that thus it shall be, as it has been said to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>But we must be cast ashore on a certain island.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>And when the fourteenth night was come, we being driven about in Adria, towards the middle of the night the sailors supposed that some land neared them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>and having sounded found twenty fathoms, and having gone a little farther and having again sounded they found fifteen fathoms;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>and fearing lest we should be cast on rocky places, casting four anchors out of the stern, they wished that day were come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>But the sailors wishing to flee out of the ship, and having let down the boat into the sea under pretext of being about to carry out anchors from the prow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these abide in the ship *ye* cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and let her fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>And while it was drawing on to daylight, Paul exhorted them all to partake of food, saying, Ye have passed the fourteenth day watching in expectation without taking food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>Wherefore I exhort you to partake of food, for this has to do with your safety; for not a hair from the head of any one of you shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>And, having said these things and taken a loaf, he gave thanks to God before all, and having broken it began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>And all taking courage, themselves also took food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>And we were in the ship, all the souls, two hundred and seventy-six.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>And having satisfied themselves with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>And when it was day they did not recognise the land; but they perceived a certain bay having a strand, on which they were minded, if they should be able, to run the ship ashore;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>and, having cast off the anchors, they left [them] in the sea, at the same time loosening the lashings of the rudders, and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the strand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>And falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship aground, and the prow having stuck itself fast remained unmoved, but the stern was broken by the force of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>And [the] counsel of the soldiers was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim off and escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>But the centurion, desirous of saving Paul, hindered them of their purpose, and commanded those who were able to swim, casting themselves first [into the sea], to get out on land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>and the rest, some on boards, some on some of the things [that came] from the ship; and thus it came to pass that all got safe to land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>And when we got safe [to land] we then knew that the island was called Melita.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>But the barbarians shewed us no common kindness; for, having kindled a fire, they took us all in because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>And Paul having gathered a [certain] quantity of sticks together in a bundle and laid [it] on the fire, a viper coming out from the heat seized his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said to one another, This man is certainly a murderer, whom, [though] saved out of the sea, Nemesis has not allowed to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>*He* however, having shaken off the beast into the fire, felt no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>But *they* expected that he would have swollen or fallen down suddenly dead. But when they had expected a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, changing their opinion, they said he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>Now in the country surrounding that place were the lands belonging to the chief man of the island, by name Publius, who received us and gave [us] hospitality three days in a very friendly way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>And it happened that the father of Publius lay ill of fever and dysentery; to whom Paul entered in, and having prayed and laid his hands on him cured him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>But this having taken place, the rest also who had sicknesses in the island came and were healed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>who also honoured us with many honours, and on our leaving they made presents to us of what should minister to our wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>And after three months we sailed in a ship which had wintered in the island, an Alexandrian, with [the] Dioscuri for its ensign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>And having come to Syracuse we remained three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>Whence, going in a circuitous course, we arrived at Rhegium; and after one day, the wind having changed to south, on the second day we came to Puteoli,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>where, having found brethren, we were begged to stay with them seven days. And thus we went to Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>And thence the brethren, having heard about us, came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Tres Tabernae, whom when Paul saw, he thanked God and took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>And when we came to Rome, [the centurion delivered up the prisoners to the praetorian prefect, but] Paul was allowed to remain by himself with the soldier who kept him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>And it came to pass after three days, that he called together those who were the chief of the Jews; and when they had come together he said to them, Brethren, *I* having done nothing against the people or the customs of our forefathers, have been delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>who having examined me were minded to let me go, because there was nothing worthy of death in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But the Jews speaking against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not as having anything to accuse my nation of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>For this cause therefore I have called you to [me] to see and to speak to you; for on account of the hope of Israel I have this chain about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>And they said to him, For our part, we have neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor has any one of the brethren who has arrived reported or said anything evil concerning thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we beg to hear of thee what thou thinkest, for as concerning this sect it is known to us that it is everywhere spoken against.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>And having appointed him a day many came to him to the lodging, to whom he expounded, testifying of the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from early morning to evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>And some were persuaded of the things which were said, but some disbelieved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>And being disagreed among themselves they left; Paul having spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Spirit through Esaias the prophet to our fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear and not understand, and seeing ye shall see and not perceive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>For the heart of this people has become fat, and they hear heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>Be it known to you therefore, that this salvation of God has been sent to the nations; *they* also will hear [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.29'>[And he having said this, the Jews went away, having great reasoning among themselves.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>And he remained two whole years in his own hired lodging, and received all who came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom unhinderedly.</verse>
