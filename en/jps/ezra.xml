      <chapter osisID='Ezra.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.1'>NOW IN the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.2'>'Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD, the God of heaven, given me; and He hath charged me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.3'>Whosoever there is among you of all His people--his God be with him--let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD, the God of Israel, He is the God who is in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.4'>And whosoever is left, in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill-offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.5'>Then rose up the heads of fathers' houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.6'>And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.7'>Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.8'>even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.9'>And this is the number of them: thirty basins of gold, a thousand basins of silver, nine and twenty knives;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.10'>thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.1'>And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.2'>Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, as it is written in the Law of Moses the man of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.3'>And they set the altar upon its bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of the countries, and they offered burnt- offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt-offerings morning and evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.4'>And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.5'>and afterward the continual burnt-offering, and the offerings of the new moons, and of all the appointed seasons of the LORD that were hallowed, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill-offering unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.6'>From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt-offerings unto the LORD; but the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.7'>They gave money also unto the hewers, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea, unto Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.8'>Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.9'>Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, and Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in the house of God; the sons of Henadad also, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.10'>And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, according to the direction of David king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.11'>And they sang one to another in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD: 'for He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever toward Israel.' And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'>But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' houses, the old men that had seen the first house standing on its foundation, wept with a loud voice, when this house was before their eyes; and many shouted aloud for joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'>so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.1'>Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple unto the LORD, the God of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'>then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers' houses, and said unto them: 'Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up hither.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers' houses of Israel, said unto them: 'Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and harried them while they were building,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.5'>and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.6'>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.7'>And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Aramaic character, and set forth in the Aramaic tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.8'>Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.9'>then wrote Rehum the commander, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinites, and the Apharesattechites, the Tarpelites, the Apharesites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehites, the Elamites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.10'>and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asenappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and the rest that are in the country beyond the River:-- 'And now--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.11'>this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king--thy servants the men beyond the River--and now</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.12'>be it known unto the king, that the Jews that came up from thee are come to us unto Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and are digging out the foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'>Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, impost, or toll, and so thou wilt endamage the revenue of the kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'>Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and announced to the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.15'>that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers; so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'>We announce to the king that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond the River.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'>Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the commander, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the River: 'Peace, and now</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'>the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'>And I decreed, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.20'>There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the country beyond the River; and tribute, impost, and toll, was paid unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.21'>Make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until a decree shall be made by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.22'>And take heed that ye be not slack herein; why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.23'>Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.24'>Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.1'>Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel prophesied they unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.2'>Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.3'>At the same time came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, and said thus unto them: 'Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this structure?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.4'>'Then spoke we unto them after this manner  ,wrote they  : What are the names of the men that build this building?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.5'>But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, till the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.6'>The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions the Apharesachites, who were beyond the River, sent unto Darius the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.7'>they sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus: 'Unto Darius the king, all peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.8'>Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth on with diligence and prospereth in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.9'>Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus: Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.10'>We asked them their names also, to announce to thee, that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.11'>And thus they returned us answer, saying: We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.12'>But because that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.13'>But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.14'>shall we again break Thy commandments, and make marriages with the peoples that do these abominations? wouldest not Thou be angry with us till Thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.15'>O LORD, the God of Israel, Thou art righteous; for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as it is this day; behold, we are before Thee in our guiltiness; for none can stand before Thee because of this.'</verse>
