And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that were with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth-gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah: 'Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead?' And he answered him: 'I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel: 'Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD today.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said unto them: 'Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?' And they said: 'Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the king.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jehoshaphat said: 'Is there not here besides a prophet of the LORD, that we might inquire of him?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat: 'There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD; but I hate him; for he never prophesieth good concerning me, but always evil; the same is Micaiah the son of Imla.' And Jehoshaphat said: 'Let not the king say so.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said: 'Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they sat in a threshing-floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said: 'Thus saith the LORD: With these shalt thou gore the Arameans, until they be consumed.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying: 'Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying: 'Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Micaiah said: 'As the LORD liveth, what my God saith, that will I speak.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him: 'Micaiah,    shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?' And he said: 'Go ye up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered into your hand.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the king said to him: 'How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said: 'I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; and the LORD said: These have no master, let them return every man to his house in peace.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: 'Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said: 'Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting upon His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand and on His left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the LORD said: who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there came forth the spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said: I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him: Wherewith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said: I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And He said: Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also; go forth, and do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets; and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the check, and said: 'Which way went the spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Micaiah said: 'Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king of Israel said: 'Take ye Micaiah; and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and say: Thus saith the king: Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with scant bread and with scant water, until I return in peace.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Micaiah said: 'If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me.' And he said: 'Hear, ye peoples, all of you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the kind of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat: 'I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.' So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now the king of Aram had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying: 'Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said: 'It is the king of Israel.' Therefore they turned about to fight against him; but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the lower armour and the breastplate; wherefore he said to the driver of the chariot: 'Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the battle increased that day; howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Arameans until the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun he died.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
