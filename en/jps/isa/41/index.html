He giveth nations before him, and maketh him rule over kings; his sword maketh them as the dust, his bow as the driven stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He pursueth them, and passeth on safely; the way with his feet he treadeth not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who hath wrought and done it? He that called the generations from the beginning.
