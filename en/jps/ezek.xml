      <chapter osisID='Ezek.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>NOW IT came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>the word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire flashing up, so that a brightness was round about it; and out of the midst thereof as the colour of electrum, out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and as for the faces and wings of them four,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>Thus were their faces; and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>And they went every one straight forward; whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like coals of fire, burning like the appearance of torches; it flashed up and down among the living creatures; and there was brightness to the fire, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel at the bottom hard by the living creatures, at the four faces thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl; and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>When they went, they went toward their four sides; they turned not when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>As for their rings, they were high and they were dreadful; and they four had their rings full of eyes round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went hard by them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the bottom, the wheels were lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>Whithersoever the spirit was to go, as the spirit was to go thither, so they went; and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>When those went, these went, and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>And over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of a firmament, like the colour of the terrible ice, stretched forth over their heads above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>And under the firmament were their wings conformable the one to the other; this one of them had two which covered, and that one of them had two which covered, their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host; when they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>For, when there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads, as they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>And I saw as the colour of electrum, as the appearance of fire round about enclosing it, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>And He said unto me: 'Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>And spirit entered into me when He spoke unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard Him that spoke unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>And He said unto me: 'Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to rebellious nations, that have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me, even unto this very day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>and the children are brazen-faced and stiff-hearted, I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them: Thus saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear--for they are a rebellious house--yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though defiers and despisers be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions; be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>And thou shalt speak My words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>And thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee: be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house; open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>and He spread it before me, and it was written within and without; and there was written therein lamentations, and moaning, and woe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>And He said unto me: 'Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that roll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>And He said unto me: 'Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee.' Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>And He said unto me: 'Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with My words unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>For thou art not sent to a people of an unintelligible speech and of a slow tongue, but to the house of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>not to many peoples of an unintelligible speech and of a slow tongue, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>But the house of Israel will not consent to hearken unto thee; for they consent not to hearken unto Me; for all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and of a stiff heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead; fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>Moreover He said unto me: 'Son of man, all My words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them: Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>Then a spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing: 'Blessed be the glory of the LORD from His place';</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>also the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>So a spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and I sat where they sat; and I remained there appalled among them seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>'Son of man, I have appointed thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; and when thou shalt hear a word at My mouth, thou shalt give them warning from Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>When I say unto the wicked: Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, I will lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die; because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>And the hand of the LORD came there upon me; and He said unto me: 'Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there speak with thee.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain; and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>Then spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and He spoke with me, and said unto me: 'Go, shut thyself within thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>But thou, son of man, behold, bands shall be put upon thee, and thou shalt be bound with them, and thou shalt not go out among them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them: Thus saith the Lord GOD; he that heareth, let him hear, and he that forbeareth, let him forbear; for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.1'>Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and trace upon it a city, even Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.2'>and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and set battering rams against it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.3'>And take thou unto thee an iron griddle, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city; and set thy face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.4'>Moreover lie thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it; according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.5'>For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days; so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.6'>And again, when thou hast accomplished these, thou shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah; forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.7'>And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered; and thou shalt prophesy against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.8'>And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast accomplished the days of thy siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.9'>Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof; according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, even three hundred and ninety days, shalt thou eat thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.10'>And thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from time to time shalt thou eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.11'>Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of a hin; from time to time shalt thou drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.12'>And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.13'>And the LORD said: 'Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations whither I will drive them.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.14'>Then said I: 'Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted; for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts; neither came there abhorred flesh into my mouth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.15'>Then He said unto me: 'See, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.16'>Moreover He said unto me: 'Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight, and with anxiety; and they shall drink water by measure, and in appalment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.17'>that they may want bread and water, and be appalled one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.1'>And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp sword, as a barber's razor shalt thou take it unto thee, and cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard; then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.2'>A third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part, and smite it with the sword round about her; and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.3'>Thou shalt also take thereof a few by number, and bind them in thy skirts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.4'>And of them again shalt thou take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; therefrom shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.5'>Thus saith the Lord GOD: This is Jerusalem! I have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are round about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.6'>And she hath rebelled against Mine ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against My statutes more than the countries that are round about her; for they have rejected Mine ordinances, and as for My statutes, they have not walked in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.7'>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Because ye have outdone the nations that are round about you, in that ye have not walked in My statutes, neither have kept Mine ordinances, neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.8'>therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and I will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.9'>And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.10'>Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter unto all the winds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.11'>Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely, because thou hast defiled My sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall Mine eye spare, and I also will have no pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.12'>A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee; and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and a third part I will scatter unto all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.13'>Thus shall Mine anger spend itself, and I will satisfy My fury upon them, and I will be eased; and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken in My zeal, when I have spent My fury upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.14'>Moreover I will make thee an amazement and a reproach, among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.15'>So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury, and in furious rebukes; I the LORD have spoken it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.16'>when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you; and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.17'>and I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken it.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.1'>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.2'>'Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.3'>and say: Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the mountains and concerning the hills, concerning the ravines and concerning the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.4'>And your altars shall become desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.5'>And I will lay the carcasses of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.6'>In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your sun-images may be hewn down, and your works may be blotted out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.7'>And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.8'>Yet will I leave a remnant, in that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.9'>And they that escape of you shall remember Me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, how that I have been anguished with their straying heart, which hath departed from Me, and with their eyes, which are gone astray after their idols; and they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.10'>And they shall know that I am the LORD; I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.11'>Thus saith the Lord GOD: Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say: Alas! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.12'>He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine; thus will I spend My fury upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.13'>And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every leafy tree, and under every thick terebinth, the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.14'>And I will stretch out My hand upon them, and make the land desolate and waste, more than the wilderness of Diblah, throughout all their habitations; and they shall know that I am the LORD.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.7'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.1'>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.2'>'And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the land of Israel: An end! the end is come upon the four corners of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.3'>Now is the end upon thee, and I will send Mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.4'>And Mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.14'>So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with whited plaster, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered; and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
