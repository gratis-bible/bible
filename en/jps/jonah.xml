  <div type='book' osisID='Jonah'>
      <chapter osisID='Jonah.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.1'>NOW THE WORD of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.2'>'Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim against it; for their wickedness is come up before Me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.3'>But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish, from the presence of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.4'>But the LORD hurled a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.5'>And the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it unto them. But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.6'>So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him: 'What meanest thou that thou sleepest? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.7'>And they said every one to his fellow: 'Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.' So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.8'>Then said they unto him: 'Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us: what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.9'>And he said unto them: 'I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.10'>Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him: 'What is this that thou hast done?' For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.11'>Then said they unto him: 'What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us?' for the sea grew more and more tempestuous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.12'>And he said unto them: 'Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you; for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.13'>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not; for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.14'>Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said: 'We beseech Thee, O LORD, we beseech Thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for Thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased Thee.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.15'>So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.16'>Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.17'>And the LORD prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jonah.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.1'>Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.2'>And he said: I called out of mine affliction unto the LORD, and He answered me; out of the belly of the nether-world cried I, and Thou heardest my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.3'>For Thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, and the flood was round about me; all Thy waves and Thy billows passed over me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.4'>And I said: 'I am cast out from before Thine eyes'; yet I will look again toward Thy holy temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.5'>The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; the deep was round about me; the weeds were wrapped about my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.6'>I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars closed upon me for ever; yet hast Thou brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.7'>When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD; and my prayer came in unto Thee, into Thy holy temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.8'>They that regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.9'>But I will sacrifice unto Thee with the voice of thanksgiving; that which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.10'>And the LORD spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jonah.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.1'>And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.2'>'Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and make unto it the proclamation that I bid thee.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.3'>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days' journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.4'>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he proclaimed, and said: 'Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.5'>And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.6'>And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.7'>And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying: 'Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing; let them not feed, nor drink water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.8'>but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.9'>Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from His fierce anger, that we perish not?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.10'>And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, which He said He would do unto them; and He did it not.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jonah.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.1'>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.2'>And he prayed unto the LORD, and said: 'I pray Thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in mine own country? Therefore I fled beforehand unto Tarshish; for I knew that Thou art a gracious God, and compassionate, long- suffering, and abundant in mercy, and repentest Thee of the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.3'>Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech Thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.4'>And the LORD said: 'Art thou greatly angry?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.5'>Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.6'>And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his evil. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.7'>But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.8'>And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said: 'It is better for me to die than to live.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.9'>And God said to Jonah: 'Art thou greatly angry for the gourd?' And he said: 'I am greatly angry, even unto death.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.10'>And the LORD said: 'Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow, which came up in a night, and perished in a night;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.11'>and should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?'</verse>
