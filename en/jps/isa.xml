      <chapter osisID='Isa.1'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>THE VISION of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the LORD hath spoken: Children I have reared, and brought up, and they have rebelled against Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but Israel doth not know, My people doth not consider.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that deal corruptly; they have forsaken the LORD, they have contemned the Holy One of Israel, they are turned away backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>On what part will ye yet be stricken, seeing ye stray away more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and festering sores: they have not been pressed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by floods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me? saith the LORD; I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>When ye come to appear before Me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample My courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>Bring no more vain oblations; it is an offering of abomination unto Me; new moon and sabbath, the holding of convocations--I cannot endure iniquity along with the solemn assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>Your new moons and your appointed seasons My soul hateth; they are a burden unto Me; I am weary to bear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide Mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes, cease to do evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>Learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'>How is the faithful city become a harlot! She that was full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth bribes, and followeth after rewards; they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah, I will ease Me of Mine adversaries, and avenge Me of Mine enemies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>And I will turn My hand upon thee, and purge away thy dross as with lye, and will take away all thine alloy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning; afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and they that return of her with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>But the destruction of the transgressors and the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>For they shall be ashamed of the terebinths which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>For ye shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>And the strong shall be as tow, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'>And it shall come to pass in the end of days, that the mountain of the LORD'S house shall be established as the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'>And many peoples shall go and say: 'Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths.' For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>And He shall judge between the nations, and shall decide for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>For Thou hast forsaken Thy people the house of Jacob; for they are replenished from the east, and with soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the brood of aliens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'>Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land also is full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>Their land also is full of idols; every one worshippeth the work of his own hands, that which his own fingers have made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>And man boweth down, and man lowereth himself; and Thou canst not bear with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, from before the terror of the LORD, and from the glory of His majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The lofty looks of man shall be brought low, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>For the LORD of hosts hath a day upon all that is proud and lofty, and upon all that is lifted up, and it shall be brought low;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>And upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>And upon every lofty tower, and upon every fortified wall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all delightful imagery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'>And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'>And the idols shall utterly pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'>And men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the terror of the LORD, and from the glory of His majesty, when He ariseth to shake mightily the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'>In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made for themselves to worship, to the moles and to the bats;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'>To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the crevices of the crags, from before the terror of the LORD, and from the glory of His majesty, when he ariseth to shake mightily the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'>Cease ye from man, in whose nostrils is a breath; for how little is he to be accounted!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'>For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, every stay of bread, and every stay of water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'>The mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'>The captain of fifty, and the man of rank, and the counsellor, and the cunning charmer, and the skilful enchanter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'>And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'>And the people shall oppress one another, every man his fellow, and every man his neighbour; the child shall behave insolently against the aged, and the base against the honourable,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'>For a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father: 'Thou hast a mantle, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'>In that day shall he swear, saying: 'I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor a mantle; ye shall not make me ruler of a people.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of His glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'>The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have wrought evil unto themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'>Say ye of the righteous, that it shall be well with him; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'>Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him; for the work of his hands shall be done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>As for My people, a babe is their master, and women rule over them. O My people, they that lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'>The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'>The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders of His people, and the princes thereof: 'It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'>What mean ye that ye crush My people, and grind the face of the poor?' saith the Lord, the GOD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'>Moreover the LORD said: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched-forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'>Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will lay bare their secret parts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'>In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their anklets, and the fillets, and the crescents;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'>the pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'>the headtires, and the armlets, and the sashes, and the corselets, and the amulets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'>the rings, and the nose-jewels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.22'>the aprons, and the mantelets, and the cloaks, and the girdles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'>and the gauze robes, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the mantles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'>And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness; and instead of a girdle rags; and instead of curled hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; branding instead of beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'>Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'>And her gates shall lament and mourn; and utterly bereft she shall sit upon the ground.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'>And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying: 'We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy name; take thou away our reproach.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'>In that day shall the growth of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'>And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written unto life in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.4'>when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.5'>And the LORD will create over the whole habitation of mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.6'>And there shall be a pavilion for a shadow in the day-time from the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'>Let me sing of my well-beloved, a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well-beloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'>And he digged it, and cleared it of stones, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a vat therein; and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'>And now come, I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down the fence thereof, and it shall be trodden down;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'>And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned nor hoed, but there shall come up briers and thorns; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'>For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah the plant of His delight; and He looked for justice, but behold violence; for righteousness, but behold a cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'>Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'>In mine ears said the LORD of hosts: of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'>For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'>Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'>And the harp and the psaltery, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are in their feasts; but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither have they considered the operation of His hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'>Therefore My people are gone into captivity, for want of knowledge; and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'>Therefore the nether-world hath enlarged her desire, and opened her mouth without measure; and down goeth their glory, and their tumult, and their uproar, and he that rejoiceth among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'>And man is bowed down, and man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'>But the LORD of hosts is exalted through justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified through righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'>Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'>Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'>That say: 'Let Him make speed, let Him hasten His work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.20'>Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that change darkness into light, and light into darkness; that change bitter into sweet, and sweet into bitter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.21'>Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.22'>Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'>That justify the wicked for a reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'>Therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and as the chaff is consumed in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of the LORD of hosts, and contemned the word of the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'>Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against His people, and He hath stretched forth His hand against them, and hath smitten them, and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'>And He will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'>None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'>Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'>Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions, yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'>And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea; and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and distress, and the light is darkened in the skies thereof.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'>Above Him stood the seraphim; each one had six wings: with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.3'>And one called unto another, and said: Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.4'>And the posts of the door were moved at the voice of them that called, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.5'>Then said I: Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.6'>Then flew unto me one of the seraphim, with a glowing stone in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.7'>and he touched my mouth with it, and said: Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin expiated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.8'>And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said: 'Here am I; send me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.9'>And He said: 'Go, and tell this people: hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.10'>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they, seeing with their eyes, and hearing with their ears, and understanding with their heart, return, and be healed.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.11'>Then said I: 'Lord, how long?' And He answered: 'Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.12'>And the LORD have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.13'>And if there be yet a tenth in it, it shall again be eaten up; as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they cast their leaves, so the holy seed shall be the stock thereof.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.7'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.1'>And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Aram, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it; but could not prevail against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.2'>And it was told the house of David, saying: 'Aram is confederate with Ephraim.' And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest are moved with the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.3'>Then said the LORD unto Isaiah: 'Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub    thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fullers' field;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.4'>and say unto him: Keep calm, and be quiet; fear not, neither let thy heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, and of the son of Remaliah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.5'>Because Aram hath counselled evil against thee, Ephraim also, and the son of Remaliah, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.6'>Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.7'>thus saith the Lord GOD: It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.8'>For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.9'>And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not have faith, surely ye shall not be established.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.10'>And the LORD spoke again unto Ahaz, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.11'>'Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God: ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.12'>But Ahaz said: 'I will not ask, neither will I try the LORD.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.13'>And he said: 'Hear ye now, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to weary men, that ye will weary my God also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.14'>Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: behold, the young woman shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.15'>Curd and honey shall he eat, when he knoweth to refuse the evil, and choose the good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.16'>Yea, before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings thou hast a horror of shall be forsaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.17'>The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.18'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.19'>And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the rugged valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all brambles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.20'>In that day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also sweep away the beard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.21'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall rear a young cow, and two sheep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.22'>and it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give, he shall eat curd; for curd and honey shall every one eat that is left in the midst of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.23'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, shall even be for briers and thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.24'>With arrows and with bow shall one come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.25'>And all the hills that were digged with the mattock, thou shalt not come thither for fear of briers and thorns, but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.8'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.1'>And the LORD said unto me: 'Take thee a great tablet, and write upon it in common script: The spoil speedeth, the prey hasteth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.2'>and I will take unto Me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.3'>And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said the LORD unto me: 'Call his name Maher-shalal- hashbaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.4'>For before the child shall have knowledge to cry: My father, and: My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.5'>And the LORD spoke unto me yet again, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.6'>Forasmuch as this people hath refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoiceth with Rezin and Remaliah's son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.7'>Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the River, mighty and many, even the king of Assyria and all his glory; and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.8'>And he shall sweep through Judah overflowing as he passeth through he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.9'>Make an uproar, O ye peoples, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.10'>Take counsel together, and it shall be brought to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand; for God is with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.11'>For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, admonishing me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.12'>'Say ye not: A conspiracy, concerning all whereof this people do say: A conspiracy; neither fear ye their fear, nor account it dreadful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.13'>The LORD of hosts, Him shall ye sanctify; and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.14'>And He shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.15'>And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.16'>'Bind up the testimony, seal the instruction among My disciples.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.17'>And I will wait for the LORD, that hideth His face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.18'>Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me shall be for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.19'>And when they shall say unto you: 'Seek unto the ghosts and the familiar spirits, that chirp and that mutter; should not a people seek unto their God? on behalf of the living unto the dead</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.20'>for instruction and for testimony?'--Surely they will speak according to this word, wherein there is no light.--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.21'>And they shall pass this way that are sore bestead and hungry; and it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse by their king and by their God, and, whether they turn their faces upward,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.22'>or look unto the earth, behold distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish, and outspread thick darkness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.9'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.1'>For is there no gloom to her that was stedfast? Now the former hath lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but the latter hath dealt a more grievous blow by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, in the district of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.2'>The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.3'>Thou hast multiplied the nation, Thou hast increased their joy; they joy before Thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.4'>For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, Thou hast broken as in the day of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.5'>For every boot stamped with fierceness, and every cloak rolled in blood, shall even be for burning, for fuel of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.6'>For a child is born unto us, a son is given unto us; and the government is upon his shoulder; and his name is called Pele- joez-el-gibbor-Abi-ad-sar-shalom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.7'>That the government may be increased, and of peace there be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it through justice and through righteousness from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts doth perform this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.8'>The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.9'>And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and in arrogancy of heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.10'>'The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but cedars will we put in their place.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.11'>Therefore the LORD doth set upon high the adversaries of Rezin against him, and spur his enemies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.12'>The Arameans on the east, and the Philistines on the west; and they devour Israel with open mouth. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.13'>Yet the people turneth not unto Him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.14'>Therefore the LORD doth cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.15'>The elder and the man of rank, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.16'>For they that lead this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.17'>Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall He have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for every one is ungodly and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh wantonness. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.18'>For wickedness burneth as the fire; it devoureth the briers and thorns; yea, it kindleth in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in thick clouds of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.19'>Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land burnt up; the people also are as the fuel of fire; no man spareth his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.20'>And one snatcheth on the right hand, and is hungry; and he eateth on the left hand, and is not satisfied; they eat every man the flesh of his own arm:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.21'>Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together are against Judah. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.10.1'>Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers that write iniquity;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.10.6'>I do send him against an ungodly nation, and against the people of My wrath do I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.7'>Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.10.12'>Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed His whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his haughty looks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.13'>For he hath said: by the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I am prudent; in that I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and have brought down as one mighty the inhabitants;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.14'>And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the peoples; and as one gathereth eggs that are forsaken, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or that opened the mouth, or chirped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.15'>Should the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? Should the saw magnify itself against him that moveth it? as if a rod should move them that lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up him that is not wood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.61.1'>The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to bring good tidings unto the humble; He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the eyes to them that are bound;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.2'>To proclaim the year of the LORD'S good pleasure, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.3'>To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the mantle of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called terebinths of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, wherein He might glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.4'>And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall renew the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.5'>And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and aliens shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.6'>But ye shall be named the priests of the LORD, men shall call you the ministers of our God; ye shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their splendour shall ye revel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.7'>For your shame which was double, and for that they rejoiced: 'Confusion is their portion'; therefore in their land they shall possess double, everlasting joy shall be unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.8'>For I the LORD love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity; and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.9'>And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.10'>I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, He hath covered me with the robe of victory, as a bridegroom putteth on a priestly diadem, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.11'>For as the earth bringeth forth her growth, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause victory and glory to spring forth before all the nations.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.62'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.1'>For Zion's sake will I not hold My peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her triumph go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a torch that burneth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.2'>And the nations shall see thy triumph, and all kings thy glory; and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall mark out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.3'>Thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the open hand of thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.4'>Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken, neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate; but thou shalt be called, My delight is in her, and thy land, Espoused; for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be espoused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.5'>For as a young man espouseth a virgin, so shall thy sons espouse thee; and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.6'>I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, they shall never hold their peace day nor night: 'Ye that are the LORD'S remembrancers, take ye no rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.7'>And give Him no rest, till He establish, and till He make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.8'>The LORD hath sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength: Surely I will no more give thy corn to be food for thine enemies; and strangers shall not drink thy wine, for which thou hast laboured;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.9'>But they that have garnered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD, and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of My sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.10'>Go through, go through the gates, clear ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway, gather out the stones; lift up an ensign over the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.11'>Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the earth: say ye to the daughter of Zion: 'Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.12'>And they shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD; and thou shalt be called Sought out, a city not forsaken.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.63'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.1'>'Who is this that cometh from Edom, with crimsoned garments from Bozrah? This that is glorious in his apparel, stately in the greatness of his strength?'--'I that speak in victory, mighty to save.'--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.2'>'Wherefore is Thine apparel red, and Thy garments like his that treadeth in the winevat?'--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.3'>'I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the peoples there was no man with Me; yea, I trod them in Mine anger, and trampled them in My fury; and their lifeblood is dashed against My garments, and I have stained all My raiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.4'>For the day of vengeance that was in My heart, and My year of redemption are come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.5'>And I looked, and there was none to help, and I beheld in astonishment, and there was none to uphold; therefore Mine own arm brought salvation unto Me, and My fury, it upheld Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.6'>And I trod down the peoples in Mine anger, and made them drunk with My fury, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.7'>I will make mention of the mercies of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us; and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which He hath bestowed on them according to His compassions, and according to the multitude of His mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.8'>For He said: 'Surely, they are My people, children that will not deal falsely'; so He was their Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.9'>In all their affliction He was afflicted, and the angel of His presence saved them; in His love and in His pity He redeemed them; and He bore them, and carried them all the days of old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.10'>But they rebelled, and grieved His holy spirit; therefore He was turned to be their enemy, Himself fought against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.11'>Then His people remembered the days of old, the days of Moses: 'Where is He that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of His flock? Where is He that put His holy spirit in the midst of them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.12'>That caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses? That divided the water before them, to make Himself an everlasting name?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.13'>That led them through the deep, as a horse in the wilderness, without stumbling?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.14'>As the cattle that go down into the valley, the spirit of the LORD caused them to rest; so didst Thou lead Thy people, to make Thyself a glorious name.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.15'>Look down from heaven, and see, even from Thy holy and glorious habitation; Where is Thy zeal and Thy mighty acts, the yearning of Thy heart and Thy compassions, now restrained toward me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.16'>For Thou art our Father; for Abraham knoweth us not, and Israel doth not acknowledge us; Thou, O LORD, art our Father, our Redeemer from everlasting is Thy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.17'>O LORD, why dost Thou make us to err from Thy ways, and hardenest our heart from Thy fear? Return for Thy servants' sake, the tribes of Thine inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.18'>Thy holy people they have well nigh driven out, our adversaries have trodden down Thy sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.19'>We are become as they over whom Thou never borest rule, as they that were not called by Thy name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.64'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.1'>Oh, that Thou wouldest rend the heavens, that Thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might quake at Thy presence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.2'>As when fire kindleth the brush-wood, and the fire causeth the waters to boil; to make Thy name known to Thine adversaries, that the nations might tremble at Thy presence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.3'>When Thou didst tremendous things which we looked not for--Oh that Thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might quake at Thy presence!--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.4'>And whereof from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God beside Thee, who worketh for him that waiteth for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.5'>Thou didst take away him that joyfully worked righteousness, those that remembered Thee in Thy ways--behold, Thou wast wroth, and we sinned--upon them have we stayed of old, that we might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.6'>And we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment; and we all do fade as a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.7'>And there is none that calleth upon Thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of Thee; for Thou hast hid Thy face from us, and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.8'>But now, O LORD, Thou art our Father; we are the clay, and Thou our potter, and we all are the work of Thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.9'>Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever; behold, look, we beseech Thee, we are all Thy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.10'>Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.11'>Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised Thee, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant things are laid waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.12'>Wilt Thou refrain Thyself for these things, O LORD? Wilt Thou hold Thy peace, and afflict us very sore?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.65'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.1'>I gave access to them that asked not for Me, I was at hand to them that sought Me not; I said: 'Behold Me, behold Me', unto a nation that was not called by My name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.2'>I have spread out My hands all the day unto a rebellious people, that walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.3'>A people that provoke Me to My face continually, that sacrifice in gardens, and burn incense upon bricks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.4'>That sit among the graves, and lodge in the vaults; that eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.5'>That say: 'Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou'; these are a smoke in My nose, a fire that burneth all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.6'>Behold, it is written before Me; I will not keep silence, except I have requited, yea, I will requite into their bosom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.7'>Your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, that have offered upon the mountains, and blasphemed Me upon the hills; therefore will I first measure their wage into their bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.8'>Thus saith the LORD: As, when wine is found in the cluster, one saith: 'Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it'; so will I do for My servants' sakes, that I may not destroy all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.9'>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of My mountains; and Mine elect shall inherit it, and My servants shall dwell there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.10'>And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for My people that have sought Me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.11'>But ye that forsake the LORD, that forget My holy mountain, that prepare a table for Fortune, and that offer mingled wine in full measure unto Destiny,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.12'>I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer, when I spoke, ye did not hear; but ye did that which was evil in Mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.13'>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, My servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; Behold, My servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; Behold, My servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.14'>Behold, My servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.15'>And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto Mine elect: 'So may the Lord GOD slay thee'; but He shall call His servants by another name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.16'>So that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself by the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from Mine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.17'>For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.18'>But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.19'>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in My people; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.20'>There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man, that hath not filled his days; for the youngest shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.21'>And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.22'>They shall not build, and another inhabit, they shall not plant, and another eat; for as the days of a tree shall be the days of My people, and Mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.23'>They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for terror; for they are the seed blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.24'>And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer, and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.25'>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, saith the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.66'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.1'>Thus saith the LORD: The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool; where is the house that ye may build unto Me? And where is the place that may be My resting-place?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.2'>For all these things hath My hand made, and so all these things came to be, saith the LORD; but on this man will I look, even on him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.3'>He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he broke a dog's neck; he that offereth a meal- offering, as if he offered swine's blood; he that maketh a memorial-offering of frankincense, as if he blessed an idol; according as they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.4'>Even so I will choose their mockings, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear, but they did that which was evil in Mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.5'>Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at His word: Your brethren that hate you, that cast you out for My name's sake, have said: 'Let the LORD be glorified, that we may gaze upon your joy', but they shall be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.6'>Hark! an uproar from the city, Hark! it cometh from the temple, Hark! the LORD rendereth recompense to His enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.7'>Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.8'>Who hath heard such a thing? Who hath seen such things? Is a land born in one day? Is a nation brought forth at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.9'>Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD; Shall I that cause to bring forth shut the womb? saith thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.10'>Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her; rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.11'>That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breast of her consolations; that ye may drink deeply with delight of the abundance of her glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.12'>For thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream, and ye shall suck thereof: Ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.13'>As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.14'>And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like young grass; and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward His servants, and He will have indignation against His enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.15'>For, behold, the LORD will come in fire, and His chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.16'>For by fire will the LORD contend, and by His sword with all flesh; and the slain of the LORD shall be many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.17'>They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go unto the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the detestable thing, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.18'>For I  know  their works and their thoughts;  the time  cometh, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and shall see My glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.19'>And I will work a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard My fame, neither have seen My glory; and they shall declare My glory among the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.20'>And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an offering unto the LORD, upon horses, and in chariots, and in fitters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to My holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring their offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.21'>And of them also will I take for the priests and for the Levites, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.22'>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before Me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.23'>And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.24'>And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have rebelled against Me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.</verse>
