        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'>THE PROVERBS of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'>To know wisdom and instruction; to comprehend the words of understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>To receive the discipline of wisdom, justice, and right, and equity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>To give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning, and the man of understanding may attain unto wise counsels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>To understand a proverb, and a figure; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; but the foolish despise wisdom and discipline.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they say: 'Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us lurk for the innocent without cause;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>Let us swallow them up alive as the grave, and whole, as those that go down into the pit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse'--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>My son, walk not thou in the way with them, restrain thy foot from their path;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>For in vain the net is spread in the eyes of any bird;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>And these lie in wait for their own blood, they lurk for their own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; it taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom crieth aloud in the streets, she uttereth her voice in the broad places;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>She calleth at the head of the noisy streets, at the entrances of the gates, in the city, she uttereth her words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'>'How long, ye thoughtless, will ye love thoughtlessness? And how long will scorners delight them in scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Turn you at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man attended,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>I also, in your calamity, will laugh, I will mock when your dread cometh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>When your dread cometh as a storm, and your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; when trouble and distress come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then will they call me, but I will not answer, they will seek me earnestly, but they shall not find me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>They would none of my counsel, they despised all my reproof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the waywardness of the thoughtless shall slay them, and the confidence of fools shall destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, and shall be quiet without fear of evil.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'>Yea, if thou call for understanding, and lift up thy voice for discernment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>If thou seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'>For the LORD giveth wisdom, out of His mouth cometh knowledge and discernment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.7'>He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright, He is a shield to them that walk in integrity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>That He may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way of His godly ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, and equity, yea, every good path.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'>Discretion shall watch over thee, discernment shall guard thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the men that speak froward things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>Who are crooked in their ways, and perverse in their paths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the alien woman that maketh smooth her words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>That forsaketh the lord of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>For her house sinketh down unto death, and her paths unto the shades;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>None that go unto her return, neither do they attain unto the paths of life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the whole-hearted shall remain in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and the faithless shall be plucked up out of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'>Let not kindness and truth forsake thee; bind them about thy neck, write them upon the table of thy heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'>So shalt thou find grace and good favour in the sight of God and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>Trust in the LORD with all thy heart, and lean not upon thine own understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct thy paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear the LORD, and depart from evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'>It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'>Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.10'>So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy vats shall overflow with new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.11'>My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD, neither spurn thou His correction;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.12'>For whom the LORD loveth He correcteth, even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.13'>Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that obtaineth understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.14'>For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.15'>She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'>She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that holdest her fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'>The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'>By His knowledge the depths were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew.</verse>
