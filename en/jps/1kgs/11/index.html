And he answered: 'Nothing; howbeit let me depart in any wise.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And God raised up another adversary unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them  of Zobah  ; and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did; and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Aram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labour of the house of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to Jeroboam: 'Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but he shall have one tribe, for My servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>because that they have forsaken Me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in My ways, to do that which is right in Mine eyes, and to keep My statutes and Mine ordinances, as did David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David My servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept My commandments and My statutes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David My servant may have a lamp alway before Me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen Me to put My name there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign over all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in My ways, and do that which is right in Mine eyes, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as David My servant did, that I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
