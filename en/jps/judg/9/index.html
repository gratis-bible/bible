And he said to Abimelech: 'Increase thine army, and come out.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he sent messengers unto Abimelech in Tormah, saying: 'Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem; and, behold, they will incite the city against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now therefore, up by night, thou and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city; and, behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt be able.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from the ambushment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul: 'Behold, there come people down from the tops of the mountains.' And Zebul said unto him: 'Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Gaal spoke again and said: 'See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and one company cometh by the way of Elon-meonenim.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then said Zebul unto him: 'Where is now thy mouth, that thou saidst: Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out now, I pray, and fight with them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even unto the entrance of the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah; and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and it was told Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field; and he looked, and, behold, the people were coming forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and the two companies rushed upon all that were in the field, and smote them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that were therein; and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard thereof, they entered into the hold of the house of El-berith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Abimelech got him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder; and he said unto the people that were with him: 'What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, even all they of the city, and shut themselves in, and got them up to the roof of the tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went close unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon Abimelech's head, and broke his skull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then he called hastily unto the young man his armour-bearer, and said unto him: 'Draw thy sword, and kill me, that men say not of me: A woman slew him.' And his young man thrust him through, and he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite upon their heads; and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
