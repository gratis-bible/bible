      <chapter osisID='Dan.1'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.1'>IN THE third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.2'>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god, and the vessels he brought into the treasure-house of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.3'>And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz his chief officer, that he should bring in certain of the children of Israel, and of the seed royal, and of the nobles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.4'>youths in whom was no blemish, but fair to look on, and skilful in all wisdom, and skilful in knowledge, and discerning in thought, and such as had ability to stand in the king's palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.5'>And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king's food, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.6'>Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.7'>And the chief of the officers gave names unto them: unto Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.8'>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's food, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the chief of the officers that he might not defile himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.9'>And God granted Daniel mercy and compassion in the sight of the chief of the officers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.10'>And the chief of the officers said unto Daniel: 'I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces sad in comparison with the youths that are of your own age? so would ye endanger my head with the king.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.11'>Then said Daniel to the steward, whom the chief of the officers had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.12'>'Try thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.13'>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king's food; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.14'>So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and tried them ten days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.15'>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that did eat of the king's food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.16'>So the steward took away their food, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.17'>Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.18'>And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the chief of the officers brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.19'>And the king spoke with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore stood they before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.20'>And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.21'>And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.2'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.1'>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.2'>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.3'>And the king said unto them: 'I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.4'>Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Aramaic: 'O king, live for ever! tell thy servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.5'>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans: 'The thing is certain with me; if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.6'>But if ye declare the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour; only declare unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.7'>They answered the second time and said: 'Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.8'>The king answered and said: 'I know of a truth that ye would gain time, inasmuch as ye see the thing is certain with me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.9'>that, if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; and ye have agreed together to speak before me lying and corrupt words, till the time be changed; only tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can declare unto me the interpretation thereof.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.10'>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said: 'There is not a man upon the earth that can declare the king's matter; forasmuch as no great and powerful king hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.11'>And it is a hard thing that the king asketh, and there is none other that can declare it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.12'>For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.13'>So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.14'>Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and discretion to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.15'>he answered and said to Arioch the king's captain: 'Wherefore is the decree so peremptory from the king?' Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.16'>Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, that he might declare unto the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.17'>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.18'>that they might ask mercy of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.19'>Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.20'>Daniel spoke and said: Blessed be the name of God from everlasting even unto everlasting; for wisdom and might are His;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.21'>And He changeth the times and the seasons; He removeth kings, and setteth up kings; He giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.22'>He revealeth the deep and secret things; He knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.23'>I thank Thee, and praise Thee, O Thou God of my fathers, who hath given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of Thee; for Thou hast made known unto us the king's matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.24'>Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: 'Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will declare unto the king the interpretation.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.25'>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him: 'I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.26'>The king spoke and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar: 'Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.27'>Daniel answered before the king, and said: 'The secret which the king hath asked can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor astrologers, declare unto the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.28'>but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and He hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the end of days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.29'>as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came  into thy mind  upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and He that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.30'>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.31'>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was surpassing, stood before thee; and the appearance thereof was terrible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.32'>As for that image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.33'>its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.34'>Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.35'>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them; and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.36'>This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.37'>Thou, O king, king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.38'>and wheresoever the children of men, the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the heaven dwell, hath He given them into thy hand, and hath made thee to rule over them all; thou art the head of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.39'>And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.40'>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron; forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and beateth down all things; and as iron that crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces and crush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.41'>And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the firmness of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.42'>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so part of the kingdom shall be strong, and part thereof broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.43'>And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves by the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.44'>And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed; nor shall the kingdom be left to another people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, but it shall stand for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.45'>Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter; and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.46'>Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odours unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.47'>The king spoke unto Daniel, and said: 'Of a truth it is, that your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou hast been able to reveal this secret.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.48'>Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.49'>And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel was in the gate of the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.3'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits; he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.2'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.3'>Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.4'>And the herald cried aloud: 'To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.5'>that at what time ye hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.6'>and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.7'>Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.8'>Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.9'>They spoke and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king: 'O king, live for ever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.10'>Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.11'>and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.12'>There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.13'>Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then were these men brought before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.14'>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them: 'Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.15'>Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made  ,well  ; but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is the god that shall deliver you out of my hands?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.16'>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king: 'O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.17'>If our God whom we serve is able to deliver us, He will deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and out of thy hand, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.18'>But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.19'>Then was Nebuchadnezzar filled with fury, and the form of his visage was changed, against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- nego; he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.20'>And he commanded certain mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.21'>Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics, and their robes, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.22'>Therefore because the king's commandment was peremptory, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.23'>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.24'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was alarmed, and rose up in haste; he spoke and said unto his ministers: 'Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?' They answered and said unto the king: 'True, O king.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.25'>He answered and said: 'Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.26'>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace; he spoke and said: 'Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- nego, ye servants of God Most High, come forth, and come hither.' Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.27'>And the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, and the king's ministers, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their cloaks changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.28'>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said: 'Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent His angel, and delivered His servants that trusted in Him, and have changed the king's word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.29'>Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god that is able to deliver after this sort.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.30'>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.4'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.1'>'Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; peace be multiplied unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.2'>It hath seemed good unto me to declare the signs and wonders that God Most High hath wrought toward me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.3'>How great are His signs! and how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His dominion is from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.4'>I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.5'>I saw a dream which made me afraid; and imaginings upon my bed and the visions of my head affrighted me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.6'>Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.7'>Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.8'>But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and I told the dream before him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.9'>O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret causeth thee trouble, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.10'>Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.11'>The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.12'>The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.13'>I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.14'>He cried aloud, and said thus: Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.7.2'>Daniel spoke and said: I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven broke forth upon the great sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.3'>And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.4'>The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings; I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon two feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.5'>And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was said thus unto it: 'Arise, devour much flesh.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.6'>After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the sides of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.7'>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.8'>I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.9'>I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was as white snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.10'>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.11'>I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke, I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.12'>And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.13'>I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the Ancient of days, and he was brought near before Him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.7.15'>As for me Daniel, my spirit was pained in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head affrighted me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.16'>I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.17'>'These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.18'>But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.19'>Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.20'>and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell; even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose appearance was greater than that of its fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.21'>I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.22'>until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High; and the time came, and the saints possessed the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.23'>Thus he said: 'The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.24'>And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise; and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.25'>And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.26'>But the judgment shall sit, and his dominions shall be taken away, to be consumed and to be destroy unto the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.27'>And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.28'>Here is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much affrighted me, and my countenance was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.8'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.1'>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.2'>And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the castle, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the stream Ulai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.3'>And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the stream a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.4'>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.5'>And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.6'>And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the stream, and ran at him in the fury of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.7'>And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.8'>And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly; and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up the appearance of four horns toward the four winds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.9'>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beauteous land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.10'>And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.11'>Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and from him the continual burnt-offering was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.12'>And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt-offering through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it wrought, and prospered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.13'>Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spoke: 'How long shall be the vision concerning the continual burnt-offering, and the transgression that causes appalment, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled under foot?'</verse>
