        <verse osisID='Lev.1.1'>THE LORD called unto Moses, and spoke unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.2'>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When any man of you bringeth an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd or of the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.3'>If his offering be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish; he shall bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.4'>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.5'>And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD; and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and dash the blood round about against the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.6'>And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.7'>And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.8'>And Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, and the head, and the suet, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.9'>but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall make the whole smoke on the altar, for a burnt- offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.10'>And if his offering be of the flock, whether of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.11'>And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD; and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall dash its blood against the altar round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.12'>And he shall cut it into its pieces; and the priest shall lay them, with its head and its suet, in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.13'>But the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall offer the whole, and make it smoke upon the altar; it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.14'>And if his offering to the LORD be a burnt-offering of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.15'>And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and pinch off its head, and make it smoke on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.16'>And he shall take away its crop with the feathers thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.17'>And he shall rend it by the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder; and the priest shall make it smoke upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire; it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.1'>And when any one bringeth a meal-offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.2'>And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, together with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall make the memorial-part thereof smoke upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.3'>But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons'; it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.4'>And when thou bringest a meal-offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.5'>And if thy offering be a meal-offering baked on a griddle, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.6'>Thou shalt break it in pieces, and pour oil thereon; it is a meal-offering.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.2.9'>And the priest shall take off from the meal-offering the memorial-part thereof, and shall make it smoke upon the altar--an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.10'>But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons'; it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.11'>No meal-offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven; for ye shall make no leaven, nor any honey, smoke as an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.12'>As an offering of first-fruits ye may bring them unto the LORD; but they shall not come up for a sweet savour on the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.13'>And every meal-offering of thine shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal-offering; with all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.14'>And if thou bring a meal-offering of first-fruits unto the LORD, thou shalt bring for the meal-offering of thy first-fruits corn in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.15'>And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon; it is a meal-offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.16'>And the priest shall make the memorial-part of it smoke, even of the groats thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.1'>And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace-offerings: if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.2'>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting; and Aaron's sons the priests shall dash the blood against the altar round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.3'>And he shall present of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto the LORD: the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.4'>and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away hard by the kidneys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.5'>And Aaron's sons shall make it smoke on the altar upon the burnt-offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire; it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.3.9'>And he shall present of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto the LORD: the fat thereof, the fat tail entire, which he shall take away hard by the rump-bone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.10'>and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away by the kidneys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.11'>And the priest shall make it smoke upon the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.27.1'>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.2'>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When a man shall clearly utter a vow of persons unto the LORD, according to thy valuation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.3'>then thy valuation shall be for the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.4'>And if it be a female, then thy valuation shall be thirty shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.5'>And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy valuation shall be for the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.6'>And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy valuation shall be for the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy valuation shall be three shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.7'>And if it be from sixty years old and upward: if it be a male, then thy valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.8'>But if he be too poor for thy valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the means of him that vowed shall the priest value him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.9'>And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.10'>He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.11'>And if it be any unclean beast, of which they may not bring an offering unto the LORD, then he shall set the beast before the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.12'>And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.13'>But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.14'>And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.15'>And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.16'>And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD part of the field of his possession, then thy valuation shall be according to the sowing thereof; the sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.17'>If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy valuation it shall stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.18'>But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubilee, and an abatement shall be made from thy valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.19'>And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.20'>And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.21'>But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.22'>And if he sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.23'>then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy valuation unto the year of jubilee; and he shall give thy valuation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.24'>In the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.25'>And all thy valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.26'>Howbeit the firstling among beasts, which is born as a firstling to the LORD, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is the LORD'S.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.27'>And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thy valuation, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof; or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.28'>Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man may devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.29'>None devoted, that may be devoted of men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.30'>And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S; it is holy unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.31'>And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.32'>And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.33'>He shall not inquire whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it; and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.34'>These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.</verse>
