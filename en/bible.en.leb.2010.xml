<p>With approximately one hundred different English translations of the Bible already published,<note>This figure includes translations of the New Testament alone. For one of the most comprehensive lists, see Wikipedia (<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_Bible_translations'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_Bible_translations</a>).</note> the reader may well wonder why yet another English version has been produced. Those actually engaged in the work of translating the Bible might answer that the quest for increased accuracy, the incorporation of new scholarly discoveries in the fields of semantics, lexicography, linguistics, new archaeological discoveries, and the continuing evolution of the English language all contribute to the need for producing new translations. But in the case of the Lexham English Bible (LEB), the answer to this question is much simpler; in fact, it is merely twofold.</p>
<p>First, the LEB achieves an unparalleled level of transparency with the original language text because the LEB had as its starting point the <hi type='italic'>Lexham Greek-English Interlinear New Testament</hi>. It was produced with the specific purpose of being used alongside the original language text of the Bible. Existing translations, however excellent they may be in terms of English style and idiom, are frequently so far removed from the original language texts of scripture that straightforward comparison is difficult for the average user. Of course distance between the original language text and the English translation is not a criticism of any modern English translation. To a large extent this distance is the result of the philosophy of translation chosen for a particular English version, and it is almost always the result of an attempt to convey the meaning of the original in a clearer and more easily understandable way to the contemporary reader. However, there are many readers, particularly those who have studied some biblical Greek, who desire a translation that facilitates straightforward and easy comparisons between the translation and the original language text. The ability to make such comparisons easily in software formats like Logos Bible Software makes the need for an English translation specifically designed for such comparison even more acute.</p>
<p>Second, the LEB is designed from the beginning to make extensive use of the most up-to-date lexical reference works available. For the New Testament this is primarily the third edition of Walter Bauer’s <hi type='italic'>A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature</hi> (BDAG). Users can be assured that the LEB as a translation is based on the best scholarly research available. The Greek text on which the LEB New Testament is based is that of NA27 (<hi type='italic'>Novum Testamentum Graece</hi> editio XXVII). Often referred to as the “critical” text, this is the most widely used Greek text of the New Testament in use today.</p>
<p>Naturally, when these two factors are taken into consideration, it should not be surprising that the character of the LEB as a translation is fairly literal. This is a necessary by-product of the desire to have the English translation correspond transparently to the original language text. Nevertheless, a serious attempt has been made within these constraints to produce a clear and readable English translation instead of a woodenly literal one.<note>A small amount of foreignness in a Bible translation is not necessarily a bad thing, because it reminds us that we are reading an ancient text from a different culture. Not only do the linguistic constructions differ considerably from our own, but the cultural presuppositions and assumptions differ as well. I am not convinced that, as a reader of the Bible in the early twenty-first century, I am particularly well-served if Paul comes across sounding like an op-ed columnist in the newspaper or Luke sounds like the anchor of a cable news channel on television. Clarity in translation is one thing, but obliterating the cultural distance that separate the modern reader from the first century is something else again.</note></p>
<p>There are three areas in particular that need to be addressed to make a translation like the LEB more accessible to readers today, while at the same time maintaining easy comparison with the original language text. First, differences in word order have to be addressed. In this regard, the LEB follows standard English word order, not the word order of Koiné Greek.<note>Koiné Greek (sometimes called Hellenistic Greek) is the form of Greek in which the New Testament is written.</note> Anyone who needs to see the word order of the original Greek can readily consult the <hi type='italic'>Lexham Greek-English Interlinear New Testament</hi>, which contains a sequence line which gives this information. Second, some expressions in biblical Greek are idiomatic, so that a literal translation would be meaningless or would miscommunicate the true meaning. The LEB uses <seg type='x-idiom'>˻lower corner˼</seg> brackets to indicate such expressions, with a literal rendering given in a note. Third, words which have no equivalent in the original language text must sometimes be supplied in the English translation. Because the LEB is designed to be used alongside the original language texts of scripture, these supplied words are indicated with <hi type='italic'>italics</hi>. In some cases the need for such supplied words is obvious, but in other cases where it is less clear a note has been included.</p>
<p>Finally, the reader should remember that any Bible translation, to be useful to the person using it, must actually be read. I would encourage every user of the LEB, whether reading it alongside the original languages text or not, to remember that once we understand the meaning of a biblical text we are responsible to apply it first in our own lives, and then to share it with those around us.</p>

<title>Concerning the Resurrection of the Dead</title>
<p><verse osisID='1Cor.15.12' sID='1Cor.15.12'/>Now if Christ is preached as raised up from the dead, how do some among you say that <transChange type='added'>there</transChange> is no resurrection of the dead?<verse eID='1Cor.15.12'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13' sID='1Cor.15.13'/>But if <transChange type='added'>there</transChange> is no resurrection of the dead, Christ has not been raised <transChange type='added'>either</transChange>.<verse eID='1Cor.15.13'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14' sID='1Cor.15.14'/>But if Christ has not been raised, then both our preaching <transChange type='added'>is</transChange> in vain, and your faith <transChange type='added'>is</transChange> in vain.<verse eID='1Cor.15.14'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15' sID='1Cor.15.15'/>And also we are found <transChange type='added'>to be</transChange> false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if after all, then, the dead are not raised.<verse eID='1Cor.15.15'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16' sID='1Cor.15.16'/>For if the dead are not raised, Christ has not been raised <transChange type='added'>either</transChange>.<verse eID='1Cor.15.16'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17' sID='1Cor.15.17'/>But if Christ has not been raised, your faith <transChange type='added'>is</transChange> empty; you are still in your sins.<verse eID='1Cor.15.17'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18' sID='1Cor.15.18'/>And as a further result, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.<verse eID='1Cor.15.18'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19' sID='1Cor.15.19'/>If <seg type='x-idiom'>˻we have put our hope˼</seg><note>Literally “we are having put our hope”</note> in Christ in this life only, we are of all people most pitiable.<verse eID='1Cor.15.19'/></p>
<p><verse osisID='1Cor.15.20' sID='1Cor.15.20'/>But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.<verse eID='1Cor.15.20'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21' sID='1Cor.15.21'/>For since through a man <transChange type='added'>came</transChange> death, also through a man <transChange type='added'>came</transChange> the resurrection of the dead.<verse eID='1Cor.15.21'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22' sID='1Cor.15.22'/>For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.<verse eID='1Cor.15.22'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23' sID='1Cor.15.23'/>But each in his own group: Christ the first fruits, then those <transChange type='added'>who are</transChange> Christ’s at his coming,<verse eID='1Cor.15.23'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24' sID='1Cor.15.24'/>then the end, when he hands over the kingdom to the God and Father, when he has abolished all rule and all authority and power.<verse eID='1Cor.15.24'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25' sID='1Cor.15.25'/>For it is necessary for him to reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.<verse eID='1Cor.15.25'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26' sID='1Cor.15.26'/>The last enemy to be abolished <transChange type='added'>is</transChange> death.<verse eID='1Cor.15.26'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27' sID='1Cor.15.27'/>For “he subjected all <transChange type='added'>things</transChange> under his feet.”<note>A quotation from <reference osisRef='Ps.8.6'>Ps 8:6</reference></note> But when it says “all <transChange type='added'>things</transChange>” are subjected, <transChange type='added'>it is</transChange> clear that the one who subjected all <transChange type='added'>things</transChange> to him <transChange type='added'>is</transChange> not included.<verse eID='1Cor.15.27'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28' sID='1Cor.15.28'/>But whenever all <transChange type='added'>things</transChange> are subjected to him, then the Son himself also will be subjected to the one who subjected all <transChange type='added'>things</transChange> to him, in order that God may be all in all.<verse eID='1Cor.15.28'/></p>
<p><verse osisID='1Cor.15.29' sID='1Cor.15.29'/>Otherwise, why do they do <transChange type='added'>it</transChange>, those who are being baptized on behalf of the dead?

<title>Questions Concerning the Resurrection Body</title>
<p><verse osisID='1Cor.15.35' sID='1Cor.15.35'/>But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what sort of body do they come?”<verse eID='1Cor.15.35'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36' sID='1Cor.15.36'/>Foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.<verse eID='1Cor.15.36'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37' sID='1Cor.15.37'/>And what you sow <transChange type='added'>is</transChange> not the body which it will become, but you sow the bare seed, whether perhaps of wheat or of some of the rest.<verse eID='1Cor.15.37'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38' sID='1Cor.15.38'/>But God gives to it a body just as he wishes, and to each one of the seeds its own body.<verse eID='1Cor.15.38'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39' sID='1Cor.15.39'/>Not all flesh <transChange type='added'>is</transChange> the same, but <transChange type='added'>there is</transChange> one flesh of human beings, and another flesh of animals, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish,<verse eID='1Cor.15.39'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40' sID='1Cor.15.40'/>and heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly <transChange type='added'>bodies</transChange> <transChange type='added'>is</transChange> of one kind, and the <transChange type='added'>glory</transChange> of the earthly <transChange type='added'>bodies</transChange> <transChange type='added'>is</transChange> of another kind.<verse eID='1Cor.15.40'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41' sID='1Cor.15.41'/><transChange type='added'>There is</transChange> one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars, for star differs from star in glory.<verse eID='1Cor.15.41'/></p>
<p><verse osisID='1Cor.15.42' sID='1Cor.15.42'/>Thus also <transChange type='added'>is</transChange> the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility.<verse eID='1Cor.15.42'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43' sID='1Cor.15.43'/>It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.<verse eID='1Cor.15.43'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44' sID='1Cor.15.44'/>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If <transChange type='added'>there</transChange> is a natural body, <transChange type='added'>there</transChange> is also a spiritual <transChange type='added'>body</transChange>.<verse eID='1Cor.15.44'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45' sID='1Cor.15.45'/>Thus also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul”;<note>A quotation from <reference osisRef='Gen.2.7'>Gen 2:7</reference></note> the last Adam <transChange type='added'>became</transChange> a life-giving spirit.<verse eID='1Cor.15.45'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46' sID='1Cor.15.46'/>But the spiritual <transChange type='added'>is</transChange> not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.<verse eID='1Cor.15.46'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47' sID='1Cor.15.47'/>The first man <transChange type='added'>is</transChange> from the earth, made of earth; the second man <transChange type='added'>is</transChange> from heaven.<verse eID='1Cor.15.47'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48' sID='1Cor.15.48'/>As the one <transChange type='added'>who is</transChange> made of earth, so also <transChange type='added'>are</transChange> those <transChange type='added'>who are</transChange> made of earth, and as the heavenly, so also <transChange type='added'>are</transChange> those <transChange type='added'>who are</transChange> heavenly.<verse eID='1Cor.15.48'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49' sID='1Cor.15.49'/>And just as we have borne the image of the <transChange type='added'>one who is</transChange> made of earth, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.<verse eID='1Cor.15.49'/></p>
<p><verse osisID='1Cor.15.50' sID='1Cor.15.50'/>But I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God, nor can corruption inherit incorruptibility.<verse eID='1Cor.15.50'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51' sID='1Cor.15.51'/>Behold, I tell you a mystery: we will not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed,<verse eID='1Cor.15.51'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52' sID='1Cor.15.52'/>in a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.<verse eID='1Cor.15.52'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53' sID='1Cor.15.53'/>For it is necessary <transChange type='added'>for</transChange> this perishable <transChange type='added'>body</transChange> to put on incorruptibility, and this mortal <transChange type='added'>body</transChange> to put on immortality.<verse eID='1Cor.15.53'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54' sID='1Cor.15.54'/>But whenever this perishable <transChange type='added'>body</transChange> puts on incorruptibility and this mortal <transChange type='added'>body</transChange> puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will take place:</p>

<p><verse osisID='1Cor.15.56' sID='1Cor.15.56'/>Now the sting of death <transChange type='added'>is</transChange> sin, and the power of sin <transChange type='added'>is</transChange> the law.<verse eID='1Cor.15.56'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57' sID='1Cor.15.57'/>But thanks <transChange type='added'>be</transChange> to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!<verse eID='1Cor.15.57'/> <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58' sID='1Cor.15.58'/>So then, my dear brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, <transChange type='added'>because you</transChange><note>Here “<catchWord>because</catchWord>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“know”) which is understood as causal</note> know that your labor is not <transChange type='added'>in</transChange> vain in the Lord.<verse eID='1Cor.15.58'/></p>
