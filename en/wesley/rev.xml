      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew his servants the things which must shortly come to pass: and he sent and signified them by his angel to his servant John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>Who hath testified the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things which he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Happy is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep the things which are written therein: for the time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John to the seven churches which are in Asia; Grace be unto you, and peace from him who is, and who was, and who cometh, and from the seven Spirits that are before the throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first begotten from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>To him that loved us, and hath washed us from our sins with his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto his God and Father, to him be the glory and the might for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they who have pierced him: and all the tribes of the earth shall wail because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>Yea. Amen. I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, who is, and who was, and who cometh, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I John, your brother and companion in the affliction, and in the kingdom, and patience of Jesus, was in the island Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet, Saying, what thou seest, write in a book and send to the seven churches, to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And I turned to see the voice that spake with me; and being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks, And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>like a son of man, cloathed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breast with a golden girdle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>His head and hair were white as white wool, as snow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>and his eyes as a flame of fire, And his feet like fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace, and his voice as the voice of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>And he had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword; and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead: and he laid his right-hand upon me, saying, Fear not, I am the First and the Last,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>And he that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, and have the keys of death and of Hades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write the things which thou hast seen, and which are, and which shall be hereafter:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>The mystery of the stars which thou sawest in my right hand and of the seven golden candlesticks. The stars are angels of the churches: and the candlesticks are seven churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>To the angel of the church at Ephesus write, These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right-hand, that walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, that thou canst not bear evil men; and thou hast tried those who say they are apostles and are not, and hast found them liars: And hast patience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>and hast borne for my name's sake, and hast not fainted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>But I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works: if not, I come to thee, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, unless thou repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But thou hast this, that thou hatest the works of the Nicola?tans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>And to the angel of the church of Smyrna write, These things saith the First and the Last, who was dead and is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I know thy affliction and poverty, (but thou art rich) and the reviling of those who say they are Jews and are not, but a synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Fear none of those things which thou art about to suffer: behold the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried, and ye shall have affliction ten days: Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: He that overcometh shall not be hurt by the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>And to the angel of the church at Pergamos write, These things saith he who hath the sharp two-edged sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I know where thou dwellest, where the throne of Satan is; and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, in the days wherein Antipas, my faithful witness was, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things against thee, that thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicola?tans, which I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Repent therefore; if not, I come to thee, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh will I give of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which none knoweth, but he that receiveth it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>And to the angel of the church at Thyatira write, These things saith the Son of God, who hath eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know thy love and faith, and thy service and patience, and thy last works more than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have against thee, that thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, who callest herself a prophetess, and teacheth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I gave her time to repent of her fornication; but she will not repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Behold I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her, into great affliction, unless they repent of her works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know, that I am he who searcheth the reins and hearts; and I will give you, every man, according to your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But I say to you, the rest that are at Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak, I will lay upon you no other burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>But what ye have, hold fast till I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>And he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>(And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken in pieces) as I also have received from my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>And I will give him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>And to the angel of the church at Sardis write, These things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars, I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, but art dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, which are ready to die; for I have not found thy works compleat before my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast and repent. If thou watch not, I will come as a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come upon thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>Yet thou hast a few names in Sardis, who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He that overcometh, he shall be cloathed in white raiment, and I will not blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name, before my Father and before his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>And to the angel of the church of Philadelphia write, These things saith the Holy, the True One, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and none shutteth, and shutteth and none openeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>I know thy works, (behold I have given before thee an opened door, none can shut it) that thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but lie, behold, I will make them come and lie down before thy feet, and know that I have loved thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee, from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon the whole world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>I come quickly. Hold fast what thou hast, that none take thy crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>He that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and my new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>And to the angel of the church at Laodicea write, These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: O that thou wert cold or hot!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>So because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot; I will spue thee out of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because thou sayst, I am rich, and have inriched myself, and have need of nothing, and knowest not, that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified in the fire, that thou mayst be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayst be clothed, and the shame of thy nakedness may not appear; and eye-salve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayst see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>Whomsoever I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous and repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>He that overcometh, I will give him to sit with me on my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father on his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After this I saw, and behold a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, as of a trumpet talking with me, said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>And immediately I was in the Spirit, and behold a throne was set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>And he that sat, was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone; and a rainbow was round about the throne, like an emerald to look upon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>And round about the throne were four and twenty thrones, and on the thrones four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment, and upon their heads crowns of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And out of the throne go forth lightnings and voices and thunders; and seven lamps of fire burn before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>And before the throne is a sea as of glass, like crystal; and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>And the first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature was like a calf, and the third living creature had a face as a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And the four living creatures had each of them six wings; round about and within they are full of eyes: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who cometh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And when the living creatures give glory, and honour, and thanks, to him that sitteth upon the throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>that liveth for ever and ever, The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sitteth upon the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>saying, Worthy art thou, O Lord our God, to receive the glory, and the honour, and the power, for thou hast created all things, and through thy will they are, and were created.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw in the right-hand of him that sat upon the throne a book written within and without, sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And none in heaven, or in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I wept much, that none was found worthy to open the book, neither to look thereon. And one of the elders saith to me, Weep not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book and the seals thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I beheld in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as if he had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>And he came and took the book out of the right-hand of him that sat upon the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when he took the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one an harp, and golden phials full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they sing a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book and to open the seals thereof; for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>And hast made them unto our God kings and priests, and they shall reign over the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>And I saw and heard a voice of many angels, round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive the power, and the riches, and the wisdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>and the strength, and the honour, and the glory, and the blessing. And every creature which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that are in them, I heard them all saying, To him that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb, is the blessing, and the honour, and the glory, and the power, for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four living creatures said Amen: and the elders fell down and worshiped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as the voice of thunder, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I saw, and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And there went forth another horse that was red; and to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth, that they should kill one another; and there was given him a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come. And I saw, and behold a black horse, and he that sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and hurt not the oil and the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And I saw and behold a pale horse, and he that sat on him, his name was Death, (and Hades followeth even with him) and power was given him over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the scimetar, and with famine, and with death, and by the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, thou Holy One and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And there was given to them, to every one, a white robe; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a time, till their fellow servants also and their brethren should be fulfilled, who should be killed even as they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, and the sun was black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon was as blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig-tree casteth its untimely figs, when it is shaken by a mighty wind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>And the heaven departed as a book that is rolled together, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>And the kings of the earth, and the chief captains, and the rich, and the mighty, and every slave, and every free man hid themselves in the caves, and in the rocks of the mountains:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>And said to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and cover us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>And after this I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds, that the wind should not blow upon the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>Saying, Hurt ye not the earth, neither the sea, neither the trees, till we seal the servants of our God on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>And I heard the number of them that were sealed; an hundred forty four thousand were sealed out of all the tribes of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.6'>Of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Napthali were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.7'>Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.8'>Of the tribe of Zebulon were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.9'>After this I saw, and behold a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and tribes, and people, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes and palms in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.10'>And they cry with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sitteth on the throne and to the Lamb.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.16.1'>And I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go, pour out the seven phials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.2'>And the first went and poured out his phial upon the earth, and there came a grievous sore on the men that had the mark of the wild beast, and that worshiped his image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.3'>And the second poured out his phial upon the sea, and it became as the blood of a dead man, and every living soul in the sea died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.4'>And the third poured out his phial on the rivers and fountains of waters, and they became blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.5'>And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, who art, and who wast, the Gracious one, because thou hast judged thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.6'>For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink. They are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.7'>And I heard another from the altar, saying, Yea, Lord God Almighty; true and righteous are thy judgments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.8'>And the fourth poured out his phial upon the sun; and it was given him to scorch the men with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.9'>And the men were scorched exceedingly, and blasphemed the name of God, who had power over these plagues: but they repented not to give him glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.10'>And the fifth poured out his phial upon the throne of the wild beast; and his kingdom was darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.11'>And they gnawed their tongues for pain, and blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains, and because of their sores, and repented not of their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.12'>And the sixth poured out his phial upon the great river Euphrates, and the water of it was dried up, that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.13'>And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the wild beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs (They are spirits of devils,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.14'>working miracles) go forth to the kings of the whole world, to gather them unto the battle of the great day of God, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.15'>(Behold I come as a thief. Happy is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.16'>And they gathered them together to the place which is called in the Hebrew Armageddon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.17'>And the seventh poured out his phial upon the air, and there went forth a loud voice out of the temple from the throne, saying, It is done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.18'>And there were lightnings, and voices, and a great earthquake; such as had not been since men were upon the earth, such an earthquake, so great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.19'>And the great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and Babylon the Great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.20'>And every island fled, and the mountains were not found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.21'>And a great hail, every hail-stone about the weight of a talent, falleth out of heaven upon the men; and the men blasphemed God, because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof is exceeding great.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.17'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.1'>And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven phials, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the judgment of the great whore, that sitteth upon many waters:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.2'>With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.3'>And he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet wild beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.4'>And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup, full of abominations and filthiness of her fornification:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.5'>And on her forehead a name written, Mystery; Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.6'>And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And when I saw, I wondered exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.7'>And the angel said to me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the wild beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.8'>The wild beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth, (whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world) shall wonder when they behold the wild beast, that he was, and is not, and yet will be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.9'>Here is the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sitteth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.10'>And they are seven kings: five are fallen: one is, the other is not yet come; when he cometh, he must continue a short space.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.11'>And the wild beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.12'>And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have not received the kingdom, but receive authority as kings one hour with the wild beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.13'>These have one mind, and give their power and authority to the wild beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.14'>These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.15'>And he saith to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are people, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.16'>And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the wild beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.17'>For God hath put it into their hearts, to fulfill his will, and to agree and to give their kingdom to the beast, till the words of God shall be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.18'>And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.18'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.1'>And after this I saw another angel coming down out of heaven, having great power, and the earth was inlightned with his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.2'>And he cried mightily with a loud voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become an habitation of devils, and an hold of every unclean spirit, and an hold of every unclean beast, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.3'>For all nations have drank of the wine of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich, thro' the abundance of her delicacies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.4'>And I heard another voice out of heaven, saying, Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.5'>For her sins have reached even to heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.6'>Reward her even as she hath rewarded, and give her double according to her works; in the cup which she filled, fill to her double.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.7'>As much as she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: because she saith in her heart, I sit as a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.8'>Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and sorrow, and famine; and she shall be burnt with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.9'>And the kings of the earth, who had committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall weep and mourn over her, when they see the smoke of her burning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.10'>Standing afar off for fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas! Thou great city Babylon, thou strong city! In one hour is thy judgment come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.11'>And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her; for none buyeth their merchandize any more; Merchandize of gold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.12'>and silver, and precious stone, and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all sorts of thyine wood, and all sorts of vessels of ivory, and all sorts of vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.13'>And cinnamon, and amomum, and odours, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep; and merchandize of horses and of chariots, and of bodies and souls of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.14'>And the fruits which thy soul desireth are departed from thee, and all things that were dainty and splendid are perished from thee and thou shalt find them no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.15'>The merchants of these things who became rich by her, shall stand afar off, for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, Saying, alas, alas!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.16'>The great city that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stone, and pearl: in one hour so great riches are become desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.17'>And every ship-master, and all the company belonging to ships, and sailors, and all who trade by sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.18'>stood afar off, And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city was like the great city?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.19'>And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Alas, alas! The great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea, by reason of her costliness; for in one hour she is made desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.20'>Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, and apostles, and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.21'>And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great mill-stone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall Babylon, the great city, be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.22'>And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee, and no artificer of any kind shall be found any more in thee, and the sound of a mill-stone shall be heard no more at all in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.23'>And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee, and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall be heard no more in thee: for thy merchants, were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.24'>And in her was found the blood of prophets, and saints, and of all that had been slain upon the earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.19'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.1'>After this I heard a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah: The salvation, and the glory, and the power to our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.2'>For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.3'>(And again they said Hallelujah) and her smoke ascendeth for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.4'>And the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down, and worshiped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.5'>And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, small and great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.6'>And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah: for the Lord God, the Almighty reigneth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.7'>Let us be glad and rejoice and give the glory to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.8'>And it is given to her, to be arrayed in fine linen, white and clean; the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.9'>And he saith to me, Write: Happy are they who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith to me, These are the true sayings of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.10'>And I fell before his feet to worship him: but he saith to me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.11'>And I saw the heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sitteth on him, called Faithful and True: and in righteousness he judgeth and maketh war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.12'>His eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems, and he hath a name written, which none knoweth but himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.13'>And he is clothed in a vesture dipt in blood, and his name is called, The Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.14'>And the armies which were in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in clean, fine linen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.15'>And out of his mouth goeth forth a sharp two-edged sword, that with it he may smite the nations. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.16'>And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.17'>And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, Come, and gather yourselves together to the great supper of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.18'>That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of chief captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those that sit on them, and the flesh of all men both bond and free, both small and great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.19'>And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together, to make war with him that sat on the horse and with his army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.20'>And the wild beast was taken, and with him the false prophet, who had wrought the miracles before him, with which he deceived them who had the mark of the wild beast, and them who had worshiped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.21'>And the rest were slain by the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which went forth out of his mouth; and all the birds were satisfied with their flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.20'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.1'>And I saw an angel descending out of heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.2'>And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.3'>And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he might deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled. After this he must be loosed for a small time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.4'>And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them; and I saw the souls of them who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the wild beast nor his image, neither had received the mark on their forehead or on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.5'>The rest of the dead lived not again till the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.6'>Happy and holy is he that hath a part in the first resurrection: over these the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.7'>And when the thousand years are fulfilled, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.8'>And shall go forth to deceive the nations, which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.9'>And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.10'>And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where both the wild beast and the false prophet are: and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.21'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.1'>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away: and there was no more sea.</verse>
