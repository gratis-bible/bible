      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>and Sosthenes a brother, To the church of God, which is in Corinth, to them that are sanctified through Christ Jesus, called and holy, with all that in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>That in every thing ye are inriched through him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>in all utterance and in all knowledge, As the testimony of Christ was confirmed among you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>So that ye are wanting in no good gift,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who will also confirm you to the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful, by whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you, but that ye be perfectly joined together, in the same mind and in the same judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it hath been declared to me of you, my brethren, by them of the family of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>Now this I say, every one of you saith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>Or were ye baptized into the name of Paul? I thank God, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>Lest any should say, that I had baptized in my own name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>I baptized also the family of Stephanas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>I know not that I baptized any other. For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel; but not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the doctrine of the cross is indeed to them that perish foolishness; but to us who are saved, it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and abolish the understanding of the prudent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>For whereas the Jews demand signs, and the Greeks seek wisdom, We preach Christ crucified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>But to them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>Behold your calling brethren: that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world, to shame the wise, and the weak things of the world, to shame the things that are mighty:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>And the base things of the world, and things that are despised, hath God chosen; yea, things that are not, to bring to nought the things that are; That no flesh may glory before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who is made by God unto us wisdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>That as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I determined not to know any thing among you save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>And my speech and my preaching was not with the persuasive words of human wisdom, but with the demonstration of the Spirit and of power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>That your faith might not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>Yet we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: but not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, that come to nought: But we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>which God ordained before the world for our glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>Which none of the rulers of this world knew; for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor hath ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man which is in him? So the things of God also knoweth no one, but the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things which are freely given to us of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>Which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Holy Spirit, explaining spiritual things by spiritual words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit; for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But the spiritual man discerneth all things, while he himself is discerned by no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able to bear it: nor are ye now able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>For ye are still carnal: for while there is among you emulation, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For while one saith, I am of Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>and another, I am of Apollos, are ye not carnal? Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>But he that planteth and he that watereth are one; and every one shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are fellow-labourers of God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master-builder I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon; but let every one take heed how he buildeth thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For other foundation can no man lay, than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ: And if any one build on this foundation, gold, silver, costly stones;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>wood, hay, stubble, Every one's work shall be made manifest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>for the day shall declare it: for it is revealed by fire; yea the fire shall try every one's work, of what sort it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If any one's work which he hath built thereon shall remain, he shall receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If any one's work shall be burnt, he shall suffer loss, but himself shall be saved, yet so as through the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Know ye not, that ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If any man destroy the temple of God, him shall God destroy: for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let none deceive himself: if any one among you thinketh himself to be wise, let him become a fool in this world, that he may become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; as it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Therefore let none glory in men; for all things are yours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas; or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>all are yours, And ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let a man so account us, as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But it is a very small thing with me, to be judged by you or by any man's judgment; yea, I judge not myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For I am not conscious to myself of any thing, yet am I not hereby justified; but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and manifest the counsels of the hearts. And then shall every one have praise from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>These things, brethren, I have by a figure transferred to myself and Apollos, for your sakes; that ye may learn in us, not to think of men above what is here written, that ye may not be puffed up for one above another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who maketh thee to differ from another? And what hast thou which thou hast not received? But if thou hast received it, why dost thou boast, as if thou hadst not received it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Now ye are full: now ye are rich: ye have reigned as kings without us. And I would ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For I think God hath set forth us the apostles last, as appointed to death; for we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for Christ's sake; but ye are wise in Christ: we are weak; but ye are strong: ye are honourable; but we are despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Even to this present hour, we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain abode, And labour, working with our own hands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and off-scouring of all things to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For if ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers; for I have begotten you in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>I beseech you therefore, be ye followers of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>For this cause I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Now some are puffed up, as if I would not come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord permit, and will know, not the speech of them who are puffed up, but the power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What will ye? That I come to you with a rod? or in love, and the spirit of meekness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is commonly reported, that there is fornication among you, and such fornication, as is not even named among the heathens, that one should have his father's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And are ye puffed up? Have ye not rather mourned, that he who hath done this deed, might be taken from among you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For I verily as absent in body, but present in spirit, have already,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>as if I were present, judged him who hath so done this, In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, To deliver such an one to Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your glorying is not good: know ye not, that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened; for our passover is slain for us, even Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>Therefore let us keep the feast; not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of wickedness and malignity, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote to you in an epistle, Not to converse with lewd persons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>But not altogether with the lewd persons of this world, or the covetous, or the rapacious, or idolaters, for then ye must go out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But I have now written unto you, if any who is named a brother, be a lewd person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or rapacious, not to converse with such an one, no, not to eat with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what have I to do, to judge them also that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>(But them that are without God will judge:) And ye will take away from among yourselves that wicked person.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Dare any of you, having a matter against another, refer it to the unjust, and not to the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Know ye not, that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Know ye not, that we shall judge angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>How much more things pertaining to this life? If then ye have any controversies of things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no esteem in the church?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I speak to your shame. What, is there not so much as one wise man among you, that shall be able to judge between his brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But brother goeth to law with brother, and this before the infidels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Indeed even this is altogether a fault among you, that ye have contests with each other. Why do ye not rather suffer wrong?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, even your brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Know ye not, that the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor the effeminate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor sodomites, Nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor revilers, nor the rapacious shall inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are lawful for me; but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Meats are for the belly, and the belly for meats; yet God will destroy both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Know ye not, that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>God forbid. Know ye not, that he who is joined to an harlot is one body? For they two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doth, is without the body; but he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Know ye not, that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have from God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>And ye are not your own: For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God with your body and your spirit, which are God's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote to me, It is good for a man, not to touch a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>Yet, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife; and let every woman have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>Let the husband render the debt to the wife; and in like manner the wife also to the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband; and in like manner the husband also hath not power over his own body, but the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Withdraw not from each other, unless it be by consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to prayer, and may come together again, lest Satan tempt you through your incontinence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But I say this by way of advice, not by way of precept. For I would that all men were even as myself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>but every one hath his proper gift from God, one after this manner, another after that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>But to the unmarried and the widows I say, It is good for them, if they remain even as I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>But if they have not power over themselves, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>The married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>But if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>And let not the husband put away his wife. To the rest speak I, not the Lord. If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she consent to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>And the wife, who hath an unbelieving husband, that consenteth to live with her, let her not put him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>For the unbelieving husband hath been sanctified by the wife; and the unbelieving wife hath been sanctified by the husband. Else were your children unclean; but now they are holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>But if the unbeliever will depart, let him depart: a brother or a sister is not inslaved in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>Nevertheless, he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power over his own will, and hath determined this in his heart to keep his virgin, doth well.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>That there might be no schism in the body, but that the members might have the same care for each other:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>And whether one member suffer, all the members might suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members might rejoice with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>And God hath set in the church, first, apostles, secondly, prophets, thirdly, teachers: afterward miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, different kinds of tongues.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.30'>Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? But covet earnestly the best gifts.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so as to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>And though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and deliver up my body to be burned, and have not love, it profiteth me nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>Love suffereth long and is kind; love envieth not; love acteth not rashly, is not puffed up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>Doth not behave indecently, seeketh not her own, is not provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not at iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.6'>Covereth all things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.7'>believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>And when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall vanish away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I talked as a child, I understood as a child, I reasoned as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.12'>And now we see by means of a glass obscurely; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then I shall know even as also I am known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.13'>And now abide these three, faith, hope, love; but the greatest of these is love.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Follow after love: and desire spiritual gifts; but especially that ye may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue, speaketh not to men, but to God; for no one understandeth him, though by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>Whereas he that prophesieth, speaketh to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He that speaketh in an unknown tongue, edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied; for he that prophesieth, is greater than he that speaketh with tongues, unless he interpret, that the church may receive edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you, either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophecy, or by doctrine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>So inanimate things which give a sound, whether pipe or harp, unless they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>And if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for the battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>So likewise unless ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? For ye will speak to the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>Let there be ever so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them without signification:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>Yet if I know not the meaning of the language, I shall be a barbarian to him that speaketh, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>So ye also, seeing ye desire spiritual gifts, seek to abound in them, to the edifying of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Therefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my Spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What then is my duty? I will pray with the Spirit; but I will pray with the understanding also; I will sing with the Spirit; but I will sing with the understanding also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>Otherwise if thou givest thanks with the Spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of a private person, say Amen to thy thanksgiving, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For thou verily givest thanks well; yet the other is not edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank God, that I speak with tongues more than you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>Yet in the congregation I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brethren, be not children in understanding: in wickedness be ye as infants, but in understanding be ye grown men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>It is written in the law, In foreign tongues and with foreign lips will I speak to this people; and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>So that tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; whereas prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>Yet if the whole church be met together, and all speak with unknown tongues, and there come in ignorant persons or unbelievers, will they not say, that ye are mad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>Whereas if all prophesy, and there come in an unbeliever, or an ignorant person, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>The secrets of his heart are made manifest, and so falling down on his face, he will worship God, and declare that God is among you of a truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What a thing is it, brethren, that when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>Let all things be done to edification. If any one speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two or three at most, and that by course, and let one interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in the church, and let him speak to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Let two or three of the prophets speak, and let the rest judge. But if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>let the first be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>For the Spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>Let your women be silent in the churches; for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be in subjection, as the law also saith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>And if they desire to learn any thing, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is indecent for a woman to speak in the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>Did the word of God come out from you? or did it come to you alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If any one think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you, are the commandments of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if any one is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>Therefore, brethren, covet to prophesy; yet forbid not to speak with tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>Let all things be done decently and in order.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also ye received, and wherein ye stand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>By which also ye are saved, if ye retain what I preached to you, unless ye have believed in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For I delivered to you first, that which I also received, That Christ died for our sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>according to the scriptures, And that he was buried, and that he was raised the third day according to the scriptures: And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>Afterwards he was seen by above five hundred brethren at once,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>After this he was seen by James, then by all the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>Last of all he was seen by me also, as an untimely birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain, but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>Whether therefore I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>But if Christ is preached, that he rose from the dead, how say some among you, that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>For if there be no resurrection of the dead, neither is Christ raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>And if Christ be not raised, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we testified from God, that he raised up Christ, whom he did not raise, if the dead rise not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead rise not, neither is Christ raised:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>Then also they who sleep in Christ are perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are more miserable than all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But now is Christ risen from the dead, the first-fruit of them that slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For as through Adam all die, even so through Christ shall all be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But every one in his own order: Christ the first-fruit, afterward they who are Christ's, at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy that is destroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>But when he saith, All things are put under him, it is manifest that he who did put all things under him is excepted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>But when all things shall be put under him, then shall the Son himself also be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Else what shall they do, who are baptized for the dead? If the dead rise not at all, why are they then baptized for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>Why are we also in danger every hour? I protest by your rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>If after the manner of men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Be not deceived. Evil communications corrupt good manners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But some one will say, How are the dead raised? And with what body do they come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat, or of any other corn:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to each of the seeds, its own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>All flesh is not the same flesh; but there is one kind of flesh of men, another of beasts, another of fishes, another of birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>There are also heavenly, and there are earthly bodies: but the glory of the heavenly is one, and that of the earthly another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: and one star differeth from another star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So also is the resurrection of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>It is sown an animal body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is an animal body, and there is a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>And so it is written, The first Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam is a quickening Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>Yet the spiritual body was not first, but the animal; afterward the spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man was from the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>As was the earthy, such are they also that are earthy, and as was the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Behold, I tell you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>O death, where is thy sting? O Hades, where is thy victory; The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>But thanks be to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not vain in the Lord.</verse>
