      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning existed the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>The same was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things were made by him, and without him was not one single thing made that was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shineth in darkness, but the darkness perceived it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a testimony,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>to testify of the light, that all thro' it might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not the light, but was sent to testify of the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>This was the true light, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world was made by him; yet the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own, and his own received him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But as many as received him, to them gave he privilege to become the sons of God, to them that believe in his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>Who were born, not of blood, nor by the will of the flesh, nor by the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word was made flesh, and tabernacled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John testified of him and cried, saying, This is he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is preferred before me, for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>And out of his fulness have we all received, even grace upon grace. For the law was given by Moses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>but grace and truth was by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, Who art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he confessed and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, What then, Art thou Elijah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. Then said they to him, Who art thou? That we may give an answer to them that sent us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>What sayest thou of thyself? He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>And they who were sent were of the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him and said to him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but there standeth one among you whom ye know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>He it is, who coming after me, is preferred before me, whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things were done in Bethabara, beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day he seeth Jesus coming toward him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is preferred before me; for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And I knew him not, but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John testified, saying, I saw the Spirit descending like a dove, and it abode upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I knew him not, but he that sent me to baptize with water, he had said to me, On whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, this is he who baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I saw it, and testified, that this is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Again, the next day, John was standing, and two of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>And looking upon Jesus walking, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. And Jesus turning and seeing them following,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>saith to them, What seek ye? They said to him, Rabbi, (that is, being interpreted, Master) where dwellest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He saith to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day; for it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John speak and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted the Christ.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>And he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus looking upon him, said, Thou art Simon, the son of Jonah; thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The day following he was minded to depart into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip findeth Nathanael and saith to him, We have found him, whom Moses in the law and the prophets described, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael saith to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith to him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael saith to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathagael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>Verily, verily I say to you, Hereafter ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And the third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And wine falling short, the mother of Jesus saith to him, They have not wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus saith to her, Woman, what is it to me and thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>Mine hour is not yet come. His mother saith to the servants, Whatsoever he saith to you, do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>And there were set there six water-pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three measures apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus saith to them, Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And he saith to them, Draw out now, and carry to the governor of the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>And they carried it. When the governor of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine (he knew not whence it was, but the servants, who had drawn the water knew) the governor of the feast calleth the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>And saith to him, Every man doth set out good wine first, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine till now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>Jesus wrought this beginning of miracles in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they tarried there not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>For the passover of the Jews was nigh, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, And found in the temple them that fold oxen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>and sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And having made a scourge of rushes, he drove all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers money,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>and otherthrew the tables, And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of traffick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>And his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign shewest thou us, seeing thou dost these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up in three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he spake of the temple of his body. When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, on the feast day, many believed in his name, beholding the miracles which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not trust himself to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>because he knew all men, And needed not that any should testify of man; for he knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>The same came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know, that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles which thou dost, except God be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus saith to him, How can a man be born, when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind bloweth where it lifteth, and thou hearest the found thereof, but canst not tell, whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Verily, verily I say to thee, we speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; yet ye receive not our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how would ye believe, if I told you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>For no one hath gone up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, the Son of man, who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>so must the Son of man be lifted up, That whosoever believeth on him, may not perish, but have everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him, may not perish, but have everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God sent not his Son into the world, to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved thro' him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He that believeth on him, is not condemned; but he that believeth not, is condemned already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For every one that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he that practiseth the truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea, and there he tarried with them and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>And John also was baptizing in Enon, near Salim, because there was much water there; and they came and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Then there arose a dispute between some of John's disciples and the Jews, about purifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony, behold he baptizeth, and all men come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, unless it be given him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am not the Christ, but I am sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly, because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, but I must decrease. He that cometh from above is above all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth: yet no man receiveth his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal, that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God; for God giveth not him the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life: but he that obeyeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>When therefore the Lord knew, that the Pharisees had heard, Jesus maketh and baptizeth more disciples than John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(Tho' Jesus himself batized not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>but his disciples) He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>And he must needs go thro' Samaria. Then cometh he to a city of Samaria,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>called Sychar, near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with the journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>(For his disciples were gone to the city to buy meat.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>Then saith the woman of Samaria to him, How dost thou, being a Jew, ask drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered and said to her, If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman saith to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself drank thereof, and his children, and his cattle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered and said to her, Whosoever drinketh of this water, will thirst again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, will never thirst; but the water that I shall give him, will be in him a fountain of water, springing up into everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman saith to him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>For thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband: in this thou saidst truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman saith to him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshiped in this mountain: but ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus saith to her, Woman, Believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>Ye worship ye know not what; we know what we worship; for salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeketh such worshipers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is a spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman saith to him, I know that the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus saith to her, I that speak to thee, am He.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with a woman. Yet none said, What seekest thou? Or, Why talkest thou with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>The woman then left her water-pot, and went to the city, and saith to the men, Come, see a man who told me all things that ever I did:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>Is not this the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>Then they went out of the city, and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>In the mean time his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said to them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. The disciples said one to another, Hath any man brought him to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>Jesus saith to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>My meat is, to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Say ye not, There are yet four months, and the harvest cometh? Lo, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and survey the fields, for they are white already to harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>And he that reapeth, receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit to life eternal, that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>And herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I have sent you to reap that whereon ye have bestowed no labour: others have laboured, and ye are entered into their labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>And many of the Samaritans out of that city believed on him, for the saying of the woman testifying, He told me all that ever I did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans were come to him, they besought him to tarry with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And he abode there two days. And many more believed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>because of his word, And said to the woman, We no longer believe, because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>After the two days, he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>(Now Jesus himself had testified, That a prophet hath not honour in his own country.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast. For they also had come to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>So he came again to Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and besought him, to come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jesus said to him, Unless ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The nobleman saith to him, Sir, come down, ere my child die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus saith to him, Go: thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus spake to him, and he went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>Then he asked of them the hour when he amended. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>So the father knew, it was at the same hour, in which Jesus had said to him, Thy son liveth. And himself believed, and his whole house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This second miracle again Jesus wrought, being come out of Judea into Galilee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is in Jerusalem, by the sheep-gate, a bath, which is called in the Hebrew tongue, Bethesda, having five porticos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a great multitude of diseased, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>For an angel went down at certain times into the bath, and the water was troubled: and whosoever went in first, after the troubling of the water, was made whole, whatsoever disease he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>And a certain man was there, who had been diseased eight and thirty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>Jesus seeing him lie, and knowing that he had now been diseased a long time, saith to him, Desirest thou to be made whole?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The infirm man answered him, Sir, I have no man to put me into the bath, when the water is troubled; and while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus saith to him, Rise, take up thy bed and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked: and the same day was the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>Then said the Jews to him that was healed, It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to take up the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered, He that made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>Then asked they him, Who is the man that said to thee, Take up thy bed and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>And he that was healed knew not who he was; for Jesus had retired, a multitude being in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, Lo, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man departed and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he had done these things on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, My father worketh until now, and I work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath, but also said, that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Then answered Jesus and said to them, Verily, verily I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do; but what things soever he doth, these also doth the Son likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doth: and he will shew him greater works than these, so that ye will marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raiseth and quickeneth the dead, so the Son also quickeneth whom he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For neither doth the Father judge any one, but hath given all judgment to the Son:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>That all men may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father that sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Verily, verily I say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and cometh not into condemnation, but is passed from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Verily, verily I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son also to have life in himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>And hath given him authority, to execute judgment likewise, because he is the Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Marvel not at this: for the time is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>And shall come forth, they that have done good, to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I can do nothing of myself: as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just: because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I testify of myself, my testimony is not valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is another that testifieth of me, and I know that the testimony which he testifieth of me is valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>Ye sent to John, and he bare testimony to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But I receive not testimony from man; but these things I say, that ye may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was a burning and a shining light, and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have a greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to fulfil, the very works which I do, testify of me, that the Father hath sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father who hath sent me, he hath testified of me: ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>And ye have not his word abiding in you; for whom he hath sent, ye believe not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>Search the scriptures: in them ye think ye have eternal life: and it is they that testify of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>Yet ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I receive not honour from men, But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>For I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can ye believe, while ye receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that is from God only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you even Moses, in whom ye trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After these things, Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, the sea of Tiberias,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>And a great multitude followed him, because they had seen the miracles which he did on the diseased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>But Jesus went up into a mountain, and sat there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Jesus then lifting up his eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming to him, saith to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>(But this he said, trying him; for he himself knew what he intended to do.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered him, Two hundred penny-worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that each of them may take a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith to him, Here is a lad, who hath five barley-loaves and two small fishes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>but what are they among so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Jesus said, Make the men sit down. (Now there was much grass in the place) So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>Then Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were sat down, and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>When they were filled, he saith to his disciples, Gather up the fragments which remain, that nothing be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>They therefore gathered them, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley-loaves, which remained over and above to them that had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>Then those men, having seen the miracle which Jesus did, said, Of a truth this is the prophet that was to come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Jesus therefore knowing, that they were about to come and take him by force to make him a king, again retired to the mountain all alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>In the evening, his disciples went down to the sea, And entering into the vessel, they went over the sea toward Capernaum:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>And the sea ran high, a great wind blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>And having rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh to the ship: and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But he saith to them, It is I; be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they willingly received him into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the land to which they were bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>The day following, the multitude who had stood on the other side of the sea, because they saw there was no other vessel there, save that one into which his disciples went, and that Jesus went not into the vessel with his disciples, but that his disciples were gone away alone:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>(But there came other little vessels from Tiberias, near the place where they had eaten bread,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>after the Lord had given thanks) When they saw, that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also went aboard the vessels, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>And having found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered them and said, Verily I say to you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give you; for him hath God the Father sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers ate manna in the desert, as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Then said Jesus to them, Verily, verily I say unto you, Moses gave you not the bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For the bread of God is he that cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>Then said they to him, Lord, ever give us this bread. And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But I told you, that tho' ye have seen me, ye believe not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All that the Father giveth me, will come to me, and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>And this is the will of him that sent me, That of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one who seeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>The Jews then murmured about him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then saith he, I came down from heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No man can come to me, unless the Father who hath sent me, draw him; and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh to me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness, and yet died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>I am the living bread which came down from heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever, and the bread that I will give, is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>The Jews then debated among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>But Jesus said to them, Verily, verily I say unto you, unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This is the bread which came down from heaven; not as your fathers ate manna, and died: he that eateth of this bread, shall live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>These things he said in the synagogue, teaching at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Many of his disciples hearing it, said, This is an hard saying: who can hear it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured about this, said to them, Doth this offend you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>What if ye shall see the Son of man ascend where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the Spirit that quickeneth: the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken, they are spirit and they are life.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>Therefore said I to you, That no man can come to me, unless it be given him by my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>From this time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Then said Jesus to the twelve, Are ye also minded to go away?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Then Simon Peter answered him, saying, Lord, to whom shall we go?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we have believed and known, that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen you twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>He spake of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; for he it was that would betray him, being one of the twelve.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now the Jews feast of tabernacles was nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>His brethren therefore said to him, Depart hence and go into Judea, that thy disciples there also may see the works which thou dost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For no man doth any thing in secret, but desireth to be publickly known: if thou dost these things, shew thyself to the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>And the scribes and Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery, and having set her in the midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>They say to him, Master, this woman was taken actually committing adultery.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>But they who heard it, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>Then Jesus raising himself up, and seeing none but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith to them, Even what I say to you from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true, and I speak to the world the things which I have heard from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>They understood not, that he spake to them of the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>Jesus therefore saith to them, When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.32'>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>They answered him, We are Abraham's offspring, and were never inslaved to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.38'>I speak that which I have seen with my father, and ye do that which ye have heard from your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them, If ye were the children of Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'>But now ye seek to kill me, a man who hath told you the truth which I have heard from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>Abraham did not thus. Ye do the deeds of your father. They said to him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>Jesus said to them, If God were your father, ye would love me; for I proceeded forth, and come from God. I am come not of myself, but He hath sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>Why do ye not understand my discourse? Even because ye cannot hear my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>Ye are of your father the devil, and your will is, to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth; for there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>But because I speak the truth, ye believe me not.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>Verily, verily I say unto you, if a man keep my word, he shall never see death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Whom makest thou thyself? Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me, of whom ye say, He is our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>Yet ye have not known him: but I know him. And if I should say, I know him not, I should be a liar like you; but I know him, and keep his word.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>(It was that Mary, who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick) Therefore his sisters sent to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>saying, Lord, behold he whom thou lovest is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>Jesus hearing it, said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. So after he had heard that he was sick,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>he abode still two days in the place where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after this he saith to his disciples, Let us go into Judea again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples say to him, Master, the Jews but now sought to stone thee, and goest thou thither again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if any man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>Thus he spake, and after that he saith to them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go to awake him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>Then the disciples said, Lord, if he sleep, he will recover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>Jesus spake of his death, but they thought he had spoken of the natural rest in sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then said Jesus to them plainly, Lazarus is dead. And I am glad for your sake I was not there, that ye may believe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>but let us go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then said Thomas, called Didymus, to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>When Jesus came, he found he had been now four days in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>(Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him; but Mary sat in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But I know even now, that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus saith to her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, tho' he die, yet shall he live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>And whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall not die for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>Believest thou this? She saith to him, Yea, Lord, I believe thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>Having said this, she went and privately called Mary her sister, saying, The master is come, and calleth for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>As soon as she heard it, she arose quickly and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was at the place where Martha had met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews then who were with her in the house and comforted her, seeing Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb, to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>When Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned deeply,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>and troubled himself, And said, Where have ye laid him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>They say to him, Lord, come and see. Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>Then said the Jews, Behold, how he loved him! And some of them said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>Could not this person, who opened the eyes of the blind, have even caused that this man should not have died?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus again groaning in himself, cometh to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus saith, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the deceased, saith to him, Lord, by this time he stinketh; for he hath been buried four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus saith to her, Said I not to thee, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>Then they took away the stone from where the dead lay. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>Father, I thank thee, that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but I spake this, because of the people who stand by, that they may believe thou hast sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And having spoken thus, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>And he that had been dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was wrapt about with a napkin. Jesus saith to them, Loose him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many therefore of the Jews who were come to Mary, and had seen the things, which Jesus had done, believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>Then the chief priests and elders assembled a council and said, What do we?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>For this man doth many miracles. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him, and the Romans will come and subvert both our place and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>And one of them, Caiaphas, being the high priest that year,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>said to them, Ye know nothing, Nor consider, it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>He spake not this of himself, but being high-priest that year, he prophesied, that Jesus should die for the nation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>And not for that nation only, but that he might also gather into one all the children of God that were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>Therefore from that day, they consulted together to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews, but went thence into the country, near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>And the passover of the Jews was nigh; and many went up to Jerusalem, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>Then sought they for Jesus, and said one to another, What think ye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>That he will not come to the feast? Now both the chief priests and Pharisees had given order, That if any man knew where he was, he should shew it, that they might apprehend him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Then Jesus, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>There they made him a supper, and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them who sat at table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Then Mary, taking a pound of ointment, of very costly spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>faith, Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>This he said, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the purse, and bare what was put therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Then Jesus said, Let her alone; against the day of my burial hath she kept this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>Ye have the poor always with you: but me ye have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>Now much people of the Jews knew that he was there, and came not only for the sake of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the chief priests consulted, how to kill Lazarus also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>Because, on his account, many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>The next day, a great multitude who were come to the feast, having heard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, Took branches of palm-trees, and went out to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jesus having got a young ass,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>rode thereon, as it is written, Fear not, daughter of Sion; behold thy king cometh, sitting on an asses colt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>These things his disciples understood not at first; but when Jesus had been glorified, then they remembered, that these things were written of of him, and that they had done these things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>And the people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>For this cause also the multitude went to meet him, because they heard, he had done this miracle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees therefore said to each other, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? Behold the world is gone after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now among those who came up to worship at the feast, there were certain Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>These came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we desire to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip cometh and telleth Andrew; and Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Verily, verily I say unto you, Unless a grain of wheat that falleth into the ground die, it remaineth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, shall preserve it to life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If any man serve me, let him follow me, and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>But for this cause I came, for this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then a voice came from heaven, I have both glorified, and I will glorify it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The multitude who stood and heard it, said, It thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>(He spake this, signifying what death he should die.) The people answered him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>We have heard out of the law, that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Who is this Son of man? Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness overtake you, for he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become children of light. These things spake Jesus, and retiring concealed himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But tho' he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>So that the word of the prophet Isaiah was fulfilled which he said, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Therefore they could not believe, according to what Isaiah said again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts, that they might not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and be converted, that I might heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed on him, but they did not confess him, because of the Pharisees, lest they should be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>Jesus said with a loud voice, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me, may not continue in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I am not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word which I have spoken, that shall judge him at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not spoken of myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment, what I should say, and how I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that his commandment is life everlasting; what therefore I speak to you, as the Father hath said to me, so I speak.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing his hour was come to pass out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>And while they were at supper (the devil having now put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>to betray him) Jesus knowing the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come forth from God, and going to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>Riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments, and taking a towel, girded himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>After that, he poured water into the bason, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel, wherewith he was girded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>Then cometh he to Simon Peter, who saith to him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.7'>Jesus answered and said to him, What I do, thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.8'>Peter saith to him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.9'>Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus saith to him, He who hath been bathed, needeth only to wash his feet, and is clean all over: and ye are clean; but not all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>For he knew who would betray him: therefore he said, Ye are not all clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>So after he had washed their feet, he took his garments, and sitting down again, said to them, Know ye what I have done to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.13'>Ye call me Master and Lord; and ye say well; for so I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.14'>If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye ought also to wash one another's feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.15'>For I have given you an example, that ye also may do as I have done to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.16'>Verily, verily I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.17'>If ye know these things, happy are ye, if ye do them. I speak not of you all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.18'>I know whom I have chosen, that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, hath lift up his heel against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.19'>Now I tell you before it is done, that, when it is done, ye may believe that I am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.20'>Verily, verily I say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me, and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.21'>Jesus having said this, was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily I say unto you, one of you will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.22'>Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.23'>Now there was lying in the bosom of Jesus, one of the disciples whom Jesus loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.24'>Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, to ask who it was of whom he spake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.25'>He then, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to him, Lord, who is it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.26'>Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give the sop when I have dipped it. And having dipped the sop, he giveth it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.27'>And after the sop, then Satan entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.28'>Then said Jesus to him, What thou dost, do quickly. Now none at the table knew, why he said this to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.29'>But some thought, as Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him, Buy what we have need of against the feast, or, Give something to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.30'>He then having received the sop, went out immediately. And it was night, when he went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.31'>Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.32'>If God be glorified by him, God will also glorify him with himself, and will shortly glorify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.33'>Little children, yet a little while I am with you: ye shall seek me, and as I said to the Jews, Whither I go ye cannot come, so now I say to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.34'>A new commandment I give you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.35'>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.36'>Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.37'>Peter saith to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.38'>Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily I say to thee, the cock shall not have crowed, till thou hast denied me thrice.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power over me, unless it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me to thee, hath the greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not a friend to Cesar. Whosoever maketh himself a king, opposeth Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>Pilate hearing this saying, brought Jesus forth, and sat on the judgment seat, in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>(It was then the preparation of the passover, and about the third hour:) And saith to the Jews, Behold your king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, Away with him, away with him. Pilate saith to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then delivered he him to them, to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And they took Jesus and led him away. And he bearing his cross, went forth to the place, called the place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>Where they crucified him, and two others with him, one on each side, and Jesus in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate wrote an inscription also, and put it on the cross: and the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>Many of the Jews read this inscription; for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Then said the chief priests to Pilate, Write not, the king of the Jews; but that he said, I am the king of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>And the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part, and also his vesture: now the vesture was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>They said therefore one to another, Let us not rent it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and cast lots for my vesture. These things therefore the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>Jesus therefore seeing his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus knowing, that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar. And filling a sponge with vinegar, and putting it on a stalk of hyssop, they put it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>When Jesus had taken the vinegar, he said, It is finished, and bowing the head, he gave up the Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>Now because it was the preparation, lest the bodies should remain upon the cross on the sabbath (for that sabbath was a great day) the Jews besought Pilate, that their legs might be broken, and they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But coming to Jesus, when they saw he was dead already, they brake not his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and forthwith there came out blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he that saw, hath testified it, and his testimony is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of it shall not be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they have pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea (being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews) asked Pilate leave, to take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore and took the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And Nicodemus also came (who at first had come to Jesus by night) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>So they took the body of Jesus, and wrapped it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulchre, in which no man had ever been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>There therefore they laid Jesus, because of the preparation -day of the Jews; for the sepulchre was nigh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>The first day of the week, cometh Mary Magdalene early, while it was yet dark, to the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>Then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Then Peter went out and the other disciple, and ran toward the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>They both ran together: but the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>And stooping down, he saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, And the napkin that was about his head,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>not lying with the linen clothes, but folded up in a place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple, who came first to the sepulchre, went in; and he saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went home again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping. And as she wept,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>she stooped down into the sepulchre, And seeth two angels in white sitting, where the body of Jesus had laid, one at the head, and one at the feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they said to her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them, They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>And having said this, she turned herself back, and seeth Jesus standing, but knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus saith to her, Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou? She supposing him to be the gardiner, saith to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus saith to her, Mary!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>She turning, saith to him, Rabboni; that is, Master. Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>The same day, the first day of the week, at evening, the doors being shut, where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith to them, Peace be unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And having said this, he shewed them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you. As the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And having said this, he breathed on them, and saith to them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>But Thomas called Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I see the print of the nails in his hands, and put my finger into the prints of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And eight days after, his disciples were again within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side, and be not faithless, but believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>And Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus saith to him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: happy are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>And Jesus wrought many other miracles also, in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life thro' his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; he manifested himself thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>There were together Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter saith to them, I go a fishing. They say to him, We also go with thee. They went out and entered into the vessel, but caught nothing that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>When the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Then Jesus saith to them, Children, have ye any meat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>They answered him, No. And he said to them, Cast your net on the right side of the vessel, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it, for the multitude of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>Then the disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter, It is the Lord. Simon Peter hearing that it was the Lord, girt on his upper coat (for he was stript) and threw himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>And the other disciples came in the vessel (for they were not far from land, about two hundred cubits) drawing the net, full of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>When they came ashore, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus saith to them, Bring of the fishes which ye have taken now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went on board, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three; and tho' there were so many, the net was not broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus saith to them, Come ye and dine. And none of the disciples presumed to ask him, Who art thou? Knowing that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus then cometh and taketh bread, and giveth to them, and fish likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This was the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>When they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, lovest thou me more than these do? He saith to him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He saith to him, Feed my lambs. He saith to him again, the second time, Simon, son of Jonah, lovest thou me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He saith to him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my sheep. He saith to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonah, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved, because he said to him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith to him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Verily, verily I say unto thee, when thou wast young, thou didst gird thyself, and walk whither thou wouldest: but when thou art old, thou shalt stretch out thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>This he said, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And having said this, he saith to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, what shall this man do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus saith to him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is it to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>Follow thou me. Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him, That he should not die: but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is it to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple, who testifieth of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true. And there are also many other things which Jesus did,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>which, if they were to be written particularly, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that were written.</verse>
