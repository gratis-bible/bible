      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>The former treatise have I composed, O Theophilus, of all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>Until the day he was taken up, after having thro' the Holy Ghost given commandment to the apostles, whom he had chosen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>To whom also he presented himself alive after his passion, by many infallible proofs, being seen by them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>And having assembled them together, he commanded them, not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>For John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>And when they were come together, they asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>But he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>But ye shall receive power, the Holy Ghost being come upon you, and shall be witnesses to me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>And having spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him from their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>And while they were stedfastly looking up to heaven, as he went up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>behold two men, in white apparel, stood by them, Who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing into heaven? This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, as ye have seen him going into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath-day's journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>And when they were come in, they went up into the upper-room, where both Peter and James, and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Jude the brother of James tarried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>These all continued unanimously in prayer and supplication with the women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>And in these days, Peter standing up in the midst of the disciples, (the number of persons together was about an hundred and twenty) said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>Men, brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost spake before by the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity, and falling down on his face, he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>And it was known to all that dwell at Jerusalem, so that that field is called, in their own tongue, Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His office let another take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>Wherefore of these men who have been with us all the time that the Lord Jesus was going in and out over us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>Beginning from the baptism of John, till the day that he was taken up from us, one must be ordained, to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>And they prayed and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, shew which of these two thou hast chosen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>To take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, to go to his own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>And they gave forth their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>And when the day of Pentecost was come, they were all with one accord in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>And suddenly there was a sound from heaven, as of a rushing, violent wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>And there appeared to them distinct tongues, as of fire; and it sat upon each of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together and were confounded, because every man heard them speaking in his own language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>And they were amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>And how hear we every one, in our own native language?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and dwellers in Mesopotamia, and Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Africk about Cyrene, and Roman sojourners, (Jews and Proselytes) Cretans and Arabians,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>we hear them speaking in our tongues the wonderful works of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What can this mean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>But others mocking, said, They are full of sweet wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>Then Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, Men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and hearken to my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>These are not drunken as ye suppose for it is but the third hour of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophecy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>And in those days I will pour out of my Spirit upon my servants and upon my handmaids, and they shall prophecy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>And I will shew prodigies in heaven above, and signs on earth beneath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>blood and fire, and vapour of smoke, The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the day of the Lord, the great and illustrious day, come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>But whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man pointed out to you of God, by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God wrought by him in the midst of you, as yourselves also know:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands, have crucified and slain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death, as it was not possible that he should be held under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>For David speaketh concerning him, I have seen the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right-hand, that I may not be moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue exulteth; yea, and my flesh shall rest in hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>For thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades, neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt fill me with joy by thy countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>Men and brethren, I may say to you freely of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is among us to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, That of the fruit of his loins one should sit on his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>He foreseeing this, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in Hades, neither did his flesh see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>This Jesus God hath raised up, whereof all we are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>Being therefore exalted by the right-hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>For David is not ascended into the heavens; but he saith himself, The Lord said to my Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>Sit thou on my right-hand, Until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, That God hath made this Jesus whom ye crucified, both Lord and Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>And hearing this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>And Peter said, Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>Then they, gladly receiving his word, were baptized; and there were added to them that day about three thousand souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>And they continued stedfast in the teaching of the apostles, and the fellowship, and the breaking of bread, and the prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were wrought by the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>And all that believed were together, and had all things common,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, as any one had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>And continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking the bread at home, they ate their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added daily to the church those who were saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>Now Peter and John went up together into the temple, at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>And a certain man, lame from his mother's womb, was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple, called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that were entering into the temple, Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>asked an alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>And Peter, looking stedfastly upon him, with John, said, Look on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>Then said Peter, Silver and gold have I none; but what I have, I give thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>And taking him by the right-hand, he lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankle-bones were strengthened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>And leaping up, he stood and walked, and went with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>And all the people saw him walking and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>And they knew him, that this was he who had sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple, and were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had befallen him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them, in the portico that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>And Peter seeing it, answered the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? Or, why do ye fix your eyes on us, as if by our own power or piety, we had made this man to walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his son Jesus, whom ye delivered up, and renounced him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>But ye renounced the holy one and the just, and desired a murderer to be granted you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>But ye killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead, whereof we are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>And his name, thro' faith in his name, hath strengthened this man, whom ye see and know; yea, the faith which is by him, hath given him this perfect soundness, in the presence of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>And now, brethren, I know that thro' ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>But God hath thus fulfilled the things which he foretold by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, that the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>And he may send to you Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>who was before appointed, Whom heaven must receive, till the times of the restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>For Moses truly said to the fathers, The Lord your God shall raise you up a prophet of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>And every soul who will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and them that followed, whosoever have spoken, have also foretold these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>Ye are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>God having raised up his Son, hath sent him to you first, to bless you, by turning every one of you from your iniquities.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>And as they were speaking to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>and the Saducees came upon them, Being grieved that they had healed the lame man, and preached thro' Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold till the next day: for it was now evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>But many of them who had heard the word, believed. And the number of the men was about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>And on the morrow were gathered together at Jerusalem their rulers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>and elders, and scribes, And Annas the high-priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high-priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>And having set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost, said to them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>If we are examined this day, of the benefit done to the impotent man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>by what means he is healed, Be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God hath raised from the dead, by him doth this man stand before you whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>This is the stone which was set at nought by you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>And there is salvation in no other; for there is no other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>And seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and understanding that they were illiterate and uneducated men, they marvelled, and took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>And beholding the man who had been healed, standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>But having ordered them to go out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>saying, What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a signal miracle hath been wrought by them, is manifest to all that dwell at Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>Yet that it spread no farther among the people, let us severely threaten them, that they speak no more to any man in this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>And having called them, they charged them, Not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John answering, said to them, Whether it be righteous in the sight of God, to obey you rather than God, judge ye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>For we cannot but speak the things, which we have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>And having threatened them again, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for they all glorified God for that which was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>For the man on whom this miracle of healing had been wrought, was above forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>And being let go, they went to their own company, and related all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>And when they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art the God who madest heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>Who saidst by the mouth of thy servant David, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings of the earth set themselves in array, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>For of a truth, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>To do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel before determined to be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and give thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.30'>While thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal, and signs and wonders are done thro' the name of thy holy child Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>And while they were praying, the place in which they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and spake the word of God with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart, and of one soul: and not so much as one said that ought of the things which he had, was his own, but they had all things common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>And the apostles gave forth their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power, and great grace was upon them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>For neither was there any one among them that lacked: for whosoever were possessors of houses or lands sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.35'>And laid them down at the feet of the apostles, and distribution was made to every one, according as any had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>And Joses, by the apostles surnamed Barnabas, which is, being interpreted, a son of consolation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.37'>a Levite, a Cyprian by birth, Having an estate, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the feet of the apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.2'>And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and, bringing a certain part, laid it at the feet of the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thy heart, to lie to the Holy Ghost?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>And to keep back part of the price of the land? While it remained, did it not remain thine? And when it was sold, was it not in thy power? Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart? Thou hast not lied to men, but to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.5'>And Ananias hearing these words, fell down and expired; and great fear came on all that heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.6'>And the young men arose, wound him up, and carrying him out, buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.7'>And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.8'>And Peter said to her, Tell me, if ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.9'>And Peter said to her, Why have ye agreed together, to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of them that have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.10'>And immediately she fell at his feet and expired; and the young men coming in, found her dead, and carrying her out, buried her by her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>And great fear came upon all the church, and upon all that heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>And many signs and wonders were wrought among the people by the hands of the apostles: (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's portico:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>And multitudes both of men and women believing were the more added to the Lord:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>So that they brought out the sick along the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that even the shadow of Peter coming by, might overshadow some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.16'>And multitudes also of the cities round about, came together to Jerusalem, bringing persons sick and troubled by unclean spirits; and they were all healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.17'>But the high priest arising, and all that were with him, which was the sect of the Saducees,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.18'>were filled with zeal, And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them into the common prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.19'>But an angel of the Lord opened the prison-doors, by night, and bringing them forth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.20'>said, Go, stand and speak in the temple the words of this life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>And hearing this, they went into the temple early in the morning and taught. But the high priest being come, and they that were with him, called together the council, even the whole senate of the children of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.22'>and sent to the prison, to have them brought, But when the officers came, they found them not in the prison; and returning they said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>Truly we found the prison shut with all safety, and the keepers standing before the doors; but having opened them, we found no man within.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>When the high priest, and the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them, what this should be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>Then came one and told them, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison, are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>Then the captain going with the officers brought them, not with violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.27'>And having brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.28'>Did not we strictly command you, Not to teach in this name? And lo, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and would bring the blood of this man upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>Then Peter and the other apostles answering said, We ought to obey God rather than man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>The God of our fathers hath raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, hanging him on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.31'>Him hath God exalted, a Prince and a Saviour with his right-hand, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.32'>And we are witnesses of these things, and also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.33'>When they heard this, they gnashed their teeth, and took counsel to slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>But a certain Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in honour by all the people, rising up in the council, ordered, to put the apostles out a little space:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody, to whom was joined a number of men, about four hundred, who was slain, and all who hearkened to him were scattered and came to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.37'>After this man rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the inrolment, and drew away much people after him; he also perished, and all who had hearkened to him were dispersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.38'>And now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.39'>But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, and take heed lest ye be found even fighting against God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.40'>And to him they agreed. And having called the apostles, and scourged them, they charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.41'>And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>And he said, Behold I am here, Lord. And the Lord said to him, Arise, go into the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas, for one named Saul of Tarsus; for behold, he is praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>And he hath seen in a vision a man, named Ananias, coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he may recover his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>And here also he hath authority from the chief priests, to bind all that call on thy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>But the Lord said unto him, Go: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before nations and kings, and the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>And Ananias went and entered into the house, and putting his hands on him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord hath sent me, Jesus who appeared to thee in the way thou camest, that thou mayst recover thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>And immediately as it were scales fell from his eyes, and he recovered his sight, and arose and was baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>And having received food, he was strengthened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>And he was certain days with the disciples in Damascus: And straightway he preached Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>But all that heard were amazed, and said, Is not this he who destroyed those that call on this name at Jerusalem? And came hither for this intent, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews consulted together to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>But their lying in wait was known by Saul: and they guarded the gates day and night to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>Then the disciples, taking him by night, let him down by the wall in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>And coming to Jerusalem, he endeavoured to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>But Barnabas taking him, brought him to the apostles, and declared to them, How he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus, in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.28'>And he was with them, coming in and going out at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>And preaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, he disputed with the Hellenists: but they attempted to kill him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.30'>Which the brethren knowing, brought him down to Cesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>Then the church through all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria had peace: and being built up, and walking in the fear of God, and the comfort of the Holy Ghost, was multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>And as Peter passed through all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>And he found there a certain man named Eneas, who had kept his bed eight years, being ill of a palsy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>And Peter said to him, Eneas, Jesus Christ healeth thee. Arise and make thy bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>And he arose immediately. And all that dwelt in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>Now there was at Joppa, a certain disciple, named Tabitha, which is by interpretation Dorcas; this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.37'>And in those days she was sick and died; whom having washed, they laid in an upper chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>And Lydda being near Joppa, the disciples hearing Peter was there, sent to him two men, desiring that he would not delay to come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>Then Peter arose and went with them; whom being come, they brought into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>But Peter, having put them all out, kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>And giving her his hand, and having called the saints and widows, he presented her alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>And it was known through all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.43'>And he tarried many days in Joppa, with one Simon, a tanner.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>And there was a certain man in Cesarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of that called the Italian band,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>A devout man, and fearing God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>He saw plainly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of the Lord coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>And looking stedfastly on him, and being affrighted, he said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thy alms are come up for a memorial before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>And now send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>He lodgeth with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>And when the angel who spake to him was departed, he called two of his houshold-servants, and a devout soldier, of them that waited on him continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>And having declared to them all these things, he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>On the morrow, as they journeyed and drew nigh to the city, Peter went up on the house-top, to pray, about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>And he became very hungry, and would have eaten; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel like a great sheet, tied at the four corners, descending to him, and let down on the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>Wherein were all four-footed creatures of the earth, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>And a voice came to him, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>But Peter said, In no wise, Lord: for I have never eaten any thing common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>And the voice came to him again, the second time, What God hath purified, call not thou common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>This was done thrice, and the vessel was taken up again to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>Now while Peter doubted in himself, what the vision he had seen should mean, behold the men sent by Cornelius, having inquired out Simon's house, stood at the gate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>And calling asked, Whether Simon, surnamed Peter, lodged there?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>While Peter was musing on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, men seek thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>Arise therefore and go down, and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>Then Peter going down to the men, said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: for what cause are ye come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and fearing God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned of God by an holy angel, to send for thee to his house, and to hear words from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>And he invited them in and lodged them. And the next day, Peter went away with them; and certain brethren from Joppa went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>And the day following they entered into Cesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and near friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and falling down at his feet, worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>But Peter raised him up saying, Arise: I myself also am a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>And he said to them, Ye know it is unlawful for a Jew to join with or come to one of another nation; but God hath shewed me, to call no man common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>Therefore being sent for, I came without gain-saying. I ask therefore, for what intent ye have sent for me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting till this hour, and at the ninth hour I was praying in my house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>and behold a man stood before me in bright clothing, And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are remembred before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, who is surnamed Peter: he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner by the sea, who being come, shall speak to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou hast done well in coming. Now therefore we are all present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>Then Peter opening his mouth, said, I perceive of a truth that God is not a respecter of persons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>This is the word which he sent to the children of Israel, preaching the glad tidings of peace through Jesus Christ; He is Lord of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>Ye know the word which was published through all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom yet they slew and hanged on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>(Not to all the people, but to witnesses, chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him) after he rose from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>And he commanded us, to proclaim to the people, and to testify, that it is he who is ordained by God the Judge of the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>To him give all the prophets witness, that every one who believeth in him, shall receive forgiveness of sins through his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all that were hearing the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>And the believers of the circumcision, as many as came with Peter, were amazed, that the gift of the Holy Ghost was poured out on the Gentiles also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>For they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>Then Peter answered, Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost, even as we?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they prayed him to tarry certain days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard, that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they of the circumcision debated with him, saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>and didst eat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>Then Peter beginning, laid all things before them in order, saying, I was praying in the city of Joppa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>and being in a trance, I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down from heaven by the four corners, and it came even to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>On which looking stedfastly, I observed and saw four-footed creatures of the earth, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>And I heard a voice saying to me, Rise Peter, kill and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>But I said, In no wise, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>And the voice from heaven answered me again, What God hath purified, call not thou common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>This was done thrice, and all were drawn up again into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>And behold immediately three men stood at the house where I was, sent from Cesarea to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>And the Spirit bad me go with them, doubting nothing: these six brethren also went with me, and we entered into the man's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>And he told us, how he had seen an angel standing in his house, and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and call Simon,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>If then God gave to them the same gift as even to us, having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that could withstand God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>When they heard these things, they were quiet, and glorified God, saying, Then God hath given to the Gentiles also repentance unto life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>Now they who had been scattered abroad by the distress which arose about Stephen, travelled as far as Phenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching to none but Jews only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who coming into Antioch, spake to the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>And the hand of the Lord was with them; and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>And tidings of these things came to the ears of the church that was in Jerusalem, and they sent forth Barnabas, to go to Antioch:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>Who coming and seeing the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, to cleave unto the Lord with full purpose of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and faith. And a considerable multitude was added to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>Then went he to Tarsus to seek Saul; and having found him, he brought him to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>And a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught a considerable multitude: and the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>In those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch. And one of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>named Agabus stood up, and signified by the Spirit, that there would be a great famine through all the world; which also came to pass under Claudius Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>Then the disciples determined to send relief, every one according to his ability, to the brethren who dwelt in Judea: Which also they did,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>(Then were the days of unleavened bread. ) Whom having apprehended, he put in prison, delivering him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him, intending to bring him forth to the people after the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>So Peter was kept in the prison; but continual prayer was made to God by the church for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>And when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and the guards before the door were keeping the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood over him, and light shined in the house: and smiting Peter on the side he waked him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>When they had passed the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate that leadeth to the city, which opened to them of its own accord: and going out, they went on through one street; and immediately the angel departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>And Peter coming to himself, said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>And having considered, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John surnamed Mark, where many were gathered together praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>And as he knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>And knowing Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for joy, but running in, told them, that Peter stood before the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>And they said to her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed, it was so. Then they said, It is his angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>But Peter continued knocking. And opening the door, they saw him and were astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>But he beckoning to them with his hand, to be silent, declared to them, How the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Shew these things to James and to the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>And going out, he went to another place. Now when it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, What was become of Peter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>And Herod having sought for him, and not found him, examined the guard, and commanded them to be put to death. And going down from Judea to Cesarea, he abode there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>And he was highly incensed against them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and having gained Blastus, the king's chamberlain, sued for peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>And on a set day, Herod arrayed in royal apparel, and sitting on his throne, made an oration to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>And the people shouted, It is the voice of God, and not of a man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>And the multitude rose up together against them; and the pretors tearing off their garments, commanded to beat them with rods.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved and thy houshold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>And they spake the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in his house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>These were more ingenuous than those of Thessalonica, receiving the word with all readiness of mind, and daily searching the scriptures, whether those things were so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>Therefore many of them believed, and of the Grecian women of considerable rank, and of the men not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>But when the Jews of Thessalonica knew that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea also, they came thither likewise, and stirred up the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>Then the brethren sent away Paul immediately, to go as it were to the sea; but Silas and Timothy continued there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens, and having received an order to Silas and Timothy, to come to him with all speed, they departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>Now, while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him, seeing the city wholly given to idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>He therefore discoursed in the synagogue to the Jews and the devout persons, and in the market-place daily to those whom he met with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>Then some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers incountered him: and some said, What would this babler say? Others, he seemeth to be a proclaimer of strange gods; because he preached to them Jesus, and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, which is spoken by thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears; we would therefore know, what these things mean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>(For all the Athenians, and the strangers sojourning there, spent their time in nothing else, but telling or hearing some new thing.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>Then Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that ye are greatly addicted to the worship of invisible powers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>For as I passed along and beheld the objects of your worship, I found an altar, on which was inscribed, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD: him therefore whom ye worship without knowing him, I proclaim unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>God who made the world and all things therein, being the Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>Neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed any thing, he himself giving to all life and breath, and all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>And he hath made of one the whole nation of men, to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>That they might seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he be not far from every one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>For in him we live and move, and have our being; as certain likewise of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think the Godhead is like gold or silver, or stone, graven by art and contrivance of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>The times of ignorance indeed God overlooked; but he now commandeth all men every where to repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>Because he hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world righteously, by the man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given assurance to all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>And when they heard of the resurrection from the dead, some mocked: but others said, We will hear thee again concerning this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>So Paul departed from among them. Howbeit, some clave to him and believed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>among whom was even Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>After these things, Paul departing from Athens, came to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>And finding a certain Jew name Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy with Priscilla his wife (because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome) he went to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>And as he was of the same trade, he abode with them and wrought, for they were tent-makers by trade.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>And he discoursed in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in spirit, and testified to the Jews, that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>But when they set themselves in opposition and blasphemed, he shook his raiment and said to them, Your blood is upon your own head; I am pure: from henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>And going thence, he went into the house of one named Justus, one that worshiped God, whose house was adjoining to the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>Then the Lord said to Paul by a vision, in the night, Fear not, but speak and hold not thy peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made an assault with one consent upon Paul, and brought him to the judgment-seat, Saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>And when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were an act of injustice or wicked licentiousness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>And he drove them away from the judgment-seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>Then they all took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>And Paul still continued many days; and then taking leave of the brethren, sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shaved his head at Cenchrea; for he had a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>And he came to Ephesus, and left him there; but he himself going into the synagogue, reasoned with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>But though they intreated him to tarry longer with them, he consented not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>But took his leave of them, saying, I must by all means keep the approaching feast at Jerusalem, but I will return to you again, if God will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>And he set sail from Ephesus. And landing at Cesarea, he went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>And having spent some time there, he departed, and went over the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, confirming all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>Now a certain Jew, Apollos by name, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>And he spake boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla hearing him, took him to their house, and explained to him the way of God more perfectly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>And when he was desirous to go over to Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him; who being come thither, greatly helped through grace them that had believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>For he earnesty debated with the Jews in publick, shewing by the scriptures, that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>Now while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper parts, came to Ephesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>and finding certain disciples, He said to them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost, since ye believed? And they said to him, Nay, we have not so much as heard, Whether there be any Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>He said to them, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe on him that was to come after him, that is on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>And hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>And Paul laying his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon them, and they spake with tongues and prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>And they were in all about twelve men. And going into the synagogue,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>he spake boldly, for three months discoursing and evincing the things concerning the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>But when some were hardened, and would not believe, but spake reproachfully of the way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, discoursing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>And this was done for the space of two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>So that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried from his body to the sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits came out of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>And some of the vagabond Jews, who were exorcists, undertook to name the name of the Lord Jesus, over those who had evil spirits, saying, We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>And there were seven sons of one Sceva a Jewish chief priest, who did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>But the evil spirit answering said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leaping upon them, and getting the mastery of them, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>And this was known to all both Jews and Greeks dwelling at Ephesus, and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>And many of those who believed came, confessing and openly declaring their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>Many also of those who had practised curious arts, bringing their books together, burnt them before all men, and they computed the value of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>So powerfully did the word of God grow and prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>After these things were ended, Paul purposed in spirit, having passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must see Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>And having sent two of those who ministred to him, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, he himself staid in Asia for a season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>And about that time, there arose no small tumult concerning the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>For a man named Demetrius, a silver smith, who made silver shrines of Diana, procured no small gain to the artificers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>Whom having gathered together, with the workmen employed in such things, he said, Sirs, ye know, that our maintenance arises from this occupation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>But ye see and hear, that not at Ephesus only, but almost through all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned aside much people, saying, That they are not gods, which are made with hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>So that there is danger, not only that this our craft should be set at nought, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her majesty destroyed, whom all Asia, and the world worshipeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>And hearing this, they were filled with rage, and cried out, saying, The great Diana of the Ephesians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>And the whole city was filled with confusion; and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's fellow-travellers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>And when Paul would have gone in to the people, the disciples would not suffer him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>And some also of the principal officers of Asia, being his friends, sent to him and desired, that he would not venture himself into the theatre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another; for the assembly was confused, and the greater part did not know, for what they were come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>And they thrust Alexander forward from among the multitude, the Jews pushing him on; and Alexander, waving with his hand, would have made a defence to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>But when they knew that he was a Jew, one voice arose from them all, crying out, for about two hours, The great Diana of the Ephesians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>But the register, having pacified the people, said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who knoweth not, that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>Seeing then these things cannot be denied, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>For ye have brought these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor blasphemers of your goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>If then Demetrius and the artificers that are with him, have a charge against any one, the courts are held, and there are proconsuls; let them implead one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>And indeed we are in danger to be questioned for sedition, concerning this day; there being no cause, whereby we can account for this concourse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.41'>And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>And after the tumult was ceased, Paul calling the disciples to him, and having taken his leave of them, departed to go into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>And having gone through those parts, and exhorted them with much discourse, he came into Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>And having abode there three months, an ambush being laid for him by the Jews, as he was about to sail into Syria, he determined to return by Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>And there accompanied him to Asia Sopater of Berea, and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus, and Secundus, and Caius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>These going before, staid for us at Troas, And we set sail from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>and came to them at Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>And on the first day of the week, when we were met together to break bread, Paul being to depart on the morrow, preached to them, and continued his discourse till midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>And there were many lamps in the upper room where they were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>And a certain young man, named Eutychus, sitting in a window, fell into a deep sleep: and as Paul still continued his discourse, being overpowered with sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>And Paul went down and fell on him; and taking him in his arms, said, Be not troubled; for his life is in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>And going up again, and having broken bread, he conversed long with them, even till break of day, and so departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>But we going before into the ship, sailed to Assos, where we were to take up Paul; for so he had appointed, being himself to go on foot.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>And sailing thence, we came the following day over-against Chios, and the next day we touched at Samos, and having tarried at Trogyllium, the day after came to Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, that he might not spend any time in Asia; for he hasted, if it were possible, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>And sending to Ephesus from Miletus, he called thither the elders of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>And when they were come to him, he said to them, Ye know in what manner I have conversed among you, all the time from the first day I came into Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>Serving the Lord with all humility, and with tears, and trials which befell me through the ambushes of the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>And that I have with-held nothing which was profitable, but have preached to you, and taught you, publickly and from house to house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>Testifying both to Jews and Greeks repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>And now behold, being bound by the Spirit, I go to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.23'>Save that the Holy Ghost testifieth to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life precious to myself, so I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>And now I know that ye all among whom I have conversed, proclaiming the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.26'>Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.27'>For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.28'>Take heed therefore to yourselves and to the whole flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.32'>And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, who is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among them that are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.33'>I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.34'>Yea, you yourselves know, that these hands have ministred to my necessities, and to them that were with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>I have shewed you all things, that thus labouring ye ought to help the infirm, and to remember the word of the Lord Jesus, which he himself said, It is happier to give than to receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>And having said these things, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>And they all wept sore, and falling on Paul's neck kissed him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>And having heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of believing Jews there are, and they are all zealous for the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>But they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest the Jews who are among the Gentiles, to apostatize from Moses, telling them, not to circumcise their children, nor to walk after the customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>What is it therefore? The multitude must needs come together; for they will hear that thou art come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>Therefore do this that we say to thee: there are with us four men, who have a vow on them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>Take them and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all will know, that there is nothing of those things which they have heard of thee; but that thou thyself walkest orderly, keeping the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>As touching the Gentiles that believe, we have written and determined, that they should observe no such thing; save only that they keep themselves from what is offered to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them, entered into the temple, declaring the accomplishment of the days of purification, till the offering should be offered for every one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>And when the seven days were about to be accomplished, the Jews that were from Asia seeing him in the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, Crying out, Men of Israel, help! This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: yea, and hath even brought Greeks into the temple, and polluted this holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>For they had before seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed Paul had brought into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>And the whole city was moved, and the people ran together; and laying hold on Paul, they dragged him out of the temple: and immediately the gates were shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>And as they went about to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them; and when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they ceased from beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>Then the tribune came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired, Who he was, and what he had done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>But some among the multitude cried out one thing, some another; and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>But when he came upon the stairs, he was borne of the soldiers, through the violence of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>For the multitude of people followed after, crying, Away with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he said to the chief captain, May I speak to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>Who said, Canst thou speak Greek? Art not thou that Egyptian, who before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out four thousand murtherers into the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>But Paul said, I am a man who am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, suffer me to speak to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>And when he had given him leave, Paul standing on the stairs, waved his hand to the people: and a great silence being made, he spake to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye now my defence unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>(And when they heard that he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more silence:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>and he saith) I am verily a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and accurately instructed in the law of our fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women: As likewise the high priest is my witness, and all the estate of the elders:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>from whom also I received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them who were there to Jerusalem to be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>But as I journeyed and drew near to Damascus, about noon suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>And they that were with me, saw the light, and were terrified; but they did not hear the voice of him that spake to me, And I said, What shall I do, Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>And the Lord said to me, Rise and go into Damascus, and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed thee to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>And as I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand by them that were with me, I came into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt there, Coming to me, stood and said to me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, to know his will, and see that Just one, and hear the voice of his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>For thou shalt be his witness to all men, of what thou hast seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>And now, why tarriest thou? Arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>And when I was returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>I was in a trance, And saw him saying to me, Make haste and depart quickly out of Jerusalem; for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned, and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting to his death, and kept the garments of them that slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>But he said to me, Depart: for I will send thee far off to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>And they heard him to this word, and then lifted up their voice and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit that he should live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>And as they cried out, and rent their garments, and cast dust into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>The tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle, and ordered him to be examined by scourging, that he might know, for what cause they cried so against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>And as they were binding him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a Roman, even uncondemned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>The centurion hearing it, went and told the tribune, saying, Consider what thou art about to do; for this man is a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>Then the tribune came and said to him, Tell me, Art thou a Roman?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>He said, Yea. And the tribune answered, I purchased this freedom with a great sum of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>And Paul said, But I was free-born. Then they who were going to examine him, immediately departed from him: and the tribune was afraid, after he knew he was a Roman, because he had bound him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>And on the morrow, desiring to know the certainty, what he was accused of by the Jews, he loosed him from his bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come, and bringing Paul down, set him before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>And Paul earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God till this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>And Ananias the high priest commanded them that stood by, to smite him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>Then said Paul to him, God is about to smite thee, thou whited wall. For sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>But they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>Then said Paul, I was not aware, brethren, that it was the high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not revile the ruler of thy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>But Paul perceiving, that the one part were Saducees, and the other Pharisees, cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; for the hope of the resurrection of the dead am I called in question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>And when he had said this, there arose a contention between the Pharisees and the Saducees: and the multitude was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For the Saducees say, there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>And there was a great clamour: and the scribes of the Pharisees side arising, contended, saying, We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>And as a great disturbance arose, the tribune fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>And the night following, the Lord standing by him, said, Be of good courage, Paul: for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so thou must testify at Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>And when it was day, some of the Jews entering into a conspiracy, bound themselves under a curse, saying, That they would neither eat nor drink, till they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>And they were more than forty, who had made this confederacy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves by a solemn curse, not to taste anything, till we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>Now therefore ye with the council signify to the tribune, that he bring him down to you to-morrow, as though ye would more accurately examine the things concerning him: and we, before he came near, are ready to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>But Paul's sister's son, hearing of the ambush, came, and entering into the castle, told Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>And Paul calling to him one of the centurions, said, Conduct this young man to the tribune; for he hath something to tell him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>So he took and led him to the tribune, and said, Paul the prisoner, calling me to him, desired me, to bring this young man to thee, who hath something to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>And the tribune taking him by the hand, and going aside privately asked, What is it, that thou hast to tell me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee, to bring down Paul to-morrow to the council, as if they would enquire something concerning him more accurately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>But do not yield to them; for there are more than forty of them lie in wait, who have bound themselves with a curse, neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, expecting a promise from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>So the tribune dismissed the young man, having charged him, Tell no man, that thou hast discovered these things to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>And having called to him two of the centurions, he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Cesarea, and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, by the third hour of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>And provide beasts, to set Paul upon, and conduct him safe to Felix the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>And he wrote a letter after this manner, Claudius Lysias to the most excellent Governor Felix, greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>As this man was seized by the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>and about to be killed by them, I came with the soldiery and rescued him, having learned, that he was a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>And desiring to know the crime of which they accused him, I brought him before their council: Whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>but to be charged with nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>And when it was shewn me, that an ambush was about to be laid for the man by the Jews, I immediately sent him to thee, commanding his accusers also, to say before thee what they have against him. Farewel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>The soldiers therefore, taking Paul, as it was commanded them, brought him by night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>On the morrow they returned to the castle, leaving the horsemen to go with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>Who entering into Cesarea, and delivering the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>And having read it, he asked, of what province he was?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>And being informed, that he was of Cilicia, I will give thee, said he, a thorough hearing, when thy accusers also are come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's palace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>And after five days, Ananias the high priest came down with the elders, and a certain orator, named Tertullus; and appeared before the governor against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>And he being called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing we enjoy great peace through thee, and that very worthy deeds are done to this nation by thy prudence always, and in all places, We accept it, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>But that I may not trouble thee farther,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>I beseech thee of thy clemency to hear us a few words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>For we have found this man, a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>Who hath also attempted to profane the temple; whom we seized and would have judged according to our law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>But Lysias the tribune coming upon us, with great violence took him away out of our hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>Commanding his accusers to come to thee, whereby thou mayst thyself on examination, take knowledge of all these things of which we accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>Then Paul, after the governor had made a sign to him to speak, answered, Knowing thou hast been for several years a judge to this nation, I the more chearfully answer for myself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>As thou mayst know, that it is but twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>And they neither found me disputing with any man in the temple, nor making an insurrection among the people, either in the synagogues or in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>Nor can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. But this I confess unto thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>that after the way, which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>Having hope in God, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust, which they themselves also expect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>And for this cause do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward God and toward man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purifying in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>Who ought to have been present before thee, and to accuse me, if they had any thing against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>Or let these themselves say, what crime they found in me, when I stood before the council,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>Unless it be concerning this one word, that I cried, standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead, I am called in question by you this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>And when Felix heard these things, he put them off, saying, After I have been more accurately informed concerning this way, when Lysias the tribune cometh down, I will take full cognisance of your affair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>And he commanded the centurion to keep Paul, and let him have liberty, and to hinder none of his friends from assisting or coming to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>And after some days, Felix coming with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>And as he reasoned concerning justice, temperance, and the judgment to come, Felix being terrified, answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>And he hoped also that money would have been given him by Paul to release him; therefore he sent for him the oftner, and discoursed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>But after two years, Felix was succeeded by Portius Festus: and Felix desiring to gratify the Jews, left Paul bound.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he went up from Cesarea to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews, appeared before him against Paul and besought him, Begging favour against him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying an ambush to kill him by the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>But Festus answered, That Paul should be kept at Cesarea, and that he himself would depart thither shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>Therefore let those of you, said he, who are able, go down with me and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>And having tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Cesarea; and the next day, sitting on the judgment-seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>And when he was come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem, stood round about him, bringing many and heavy accusations against Paul, which they were not able to prove:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cesar have I offended at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>But Festus, willing to gratify the Jews, answered Paul and said, Art thou willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged before me concerning these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>Then said Paul, I am standing at Cesar's judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged: I have done no wrong to the Jews, as thou also very well knowest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>For if indeed I have done wrong, and have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there is nothing of the things whereof these accuse me, no man can give me up to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>I appeal to Cesar. Then Festus, having conferred with the council answered, Hast thou appealed to Cesar? To Cesar shalt thou go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>And after certain days, king Agrippa and Bernice came to Cesarea, to salute Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>And when they had been there many days, Festus declared the case of Paul to the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>About whom when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews informed me, desiring judgment against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>To whom I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans, to give up any man, till he that is accused have the accusers face to face, and have liberty to make his defence, touching the crime laid to his charge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>When therefore they were come hither, I without any delay sat at the judgment seat the next day, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>But had certain questions against him, relating to their own religious worship, and about one Jesus that was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>And as I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked, If he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged concerning these matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But Paul appealing to be kept for the hearing of Augustus, I command him to be kept till I could send him to Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would also hear the man myself. And he said, To-morrow thou shalt hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come and Bernice with great pomp, and were entered into the place of audience, with the tribunes and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all ye who are present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have pleaded with me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out, that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>But when I found, that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and he had himself appealed to the Emperor, I determined to send him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>Of whom I have nothing certain to send to my lord: wherefore I have brought him before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that after examination taken, I may have somewhat to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>For it seemeth to me unreasonable, to send a prisoner, and not to signify also the crimes alledged against him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>Then Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>And Paul, stretching forth his hand, made his defence. I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am this day to make my defence before thee, concerning all those things whereof I am accused by the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>Who art accurately acquainted with all the customs and questions which are among the Jews, wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>The manner of my life from my youth which was from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>all the Jews know, Who knew me from the first, (if they would testify) that I lived a Pharisee, after the strictest sect of our religion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>And now I stand in judgment, for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>To which our twelve tribes, worshiping continually night and day, hope to attain: concerning which hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>What? Is it judged by you an incredible thing, that God should raise the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>I indeed thought myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>Which also I did in Jerusalem: and having received authority from the chief priests, I shut up many of the saints in prisons, and when they were killed, I gave my vote against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>And frequently punishing them in all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>Whereupon as I was going to Damascus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>with authority and commission from the chief priests, At mid-day, O king, I saw in the way, a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round me and them that journeyed with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>And when we were all fallen down to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>And I said, Who art thou, Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. But rise and stand upon thy feet; for I have appeared to thee for this purpose, to ordain thee a minister and a witness, both of the things which thou hast seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>and of those in which I will appear to thee, Delivering thee from the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>and the Gentiles, to whom I now send thee, To open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; that they may receive through faith which is in me, forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>From that time, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>But first to them at Damascus and at Jerusalem, and through all the country of Judea, and then to the Gentiles I declare, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>For these things the Jews seizing me in the temple, attempted to kill me with their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>But having obtained help from God, I continue till this day, testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what both the prophets and Moses have declared should be,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>That the Christ having suffered, and being the first who rose from the dead, should shew light to the people and to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>And as he was thus making his defence, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself, much learning doth make thee mad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>But he said, I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but utter the words of truth and sobriety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>For the king knoweth of these things; to whom also I speak with freedom; for I am persuaded none of these things are hidden from him; for this was not done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>King Agrippa, Believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but likewise all that hear me, were this day both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>And as he said this, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>And as they were going away, they spake one to another, saying, This man doth nothing worthy of death, or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Cesar.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>And as soon as it was determined, that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul, and certain other prisoners, to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan Cohort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>And going aboard a ship of Adramyttium, that was to sail by the coasts of Asia, we set sail, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>And the next day we reached Sidon. And Julius treating Paul courteously, permitted him to go to his friends, to refresh himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>And setting sail from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>And having sailed through the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>And the centurion finding a ship of Alexandria there, bound for Italy, put us on board of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were scarce come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over-against Salmone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>And passing it with difficulty, we came to the Fair Havens, near which was the city Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>And as much time was spent, and sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was already past,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>Paul exhorted them, Saying to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage is like to be with injury and much damage, not only to the lading and the ship, but also to our lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But the centurion regarded the master and the owner of the vessel, more than the things, which were spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>And as the haven was not convenient to winter in, the greater part advised to set sail from thence also, if by any means they might reach Phenice, to winter there, which is an haven of Crete looking to the south-west and north-west.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>And as the south wind blew gently, supposing they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor, and sailed on close by Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called Euroclydon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>And the ship being caught, and not able to bear up against the wind, we let her drive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>And running under a certain Island called Clauda, we were hardly able to get masters of the boat:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>Which having taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship, and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, they struck sail, and so were driven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>And as we were in an exceeding great storm, the next day they lightened the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>And as neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was then taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>But after long abstinence, Paul standing in the midst of them, said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened to me, and not have loosed from Crete, and so have avoided this injury and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>Yet now I exhort you to be of good courage; for there shall be no loss of any life among you, but of the ship only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>For there stood by me this night an angel of the God, whose I am, and whom I serve, Saying, Fear not, Paul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>thou must be presented before Cesar: and lo God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>Wherefore, Sirs, take courage: for I trust in God, that it shall be even as it hath been spoken to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>But we must be cast on a certain island.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>And when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic Sea, the sailors suspected, that they drew nigh some land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>And sounding, they found twenty fathoms; and having gone a little farther, sounding again, they found fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>And fearing lest they should fall upon some rocky ground, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>But when the sailors were attempting to flee out of the ship, and had let down the boat into the sea, under pretence that they were going to carry out anchors from the ship-head,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take food, saying, This day is the fourteenth that ye have tarried and continue fasting, having taken nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>Therefore I exhort you to take food; for this is for your preservation; for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>And having spoken thus, he took bread, and gave thanks to God before them all; and having broken it, he began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>Then were they all incouraged, and they also took meat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>And we were in the ship in all, two hundred and seventy-six souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>And when they were satisfied with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>And when it was day, they did not know the land; but they observed a certain creek having a shore, into which they were minded, if possible, to thrust the ship:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>And having taken up the anchors, they committed it to the sea, at the same time loosing the rudder-bands, and hoisting up the stay-sail to the wind, they made for the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>But falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship a ground; and the fore-part sticking fast, remained immovable, but the hinder-part was broken by the force of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>And the counsel of the soldiers was, to kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim away and escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>But the centurion, being desirous to save Paul, hindered them from their purpose, and commanded those that could swim, throwing themselves into the sea, first to get away to land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship; and so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>And being escaped, we then knew, that the island was called Melita.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>And the barbarians shewed us uncommon kindness; for having kindled a fire, they brought us all to it, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>Now as Paul was gathering a bundle of sticks, and laying them on the fire, a viper coming from the heat, fastened upon his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>And when the barbarians saw the venomous animal hanging on his hand, they said one to another, Doubtless this man is a murderer, whom though he hath escaped the sea, vengeance hath not suffered to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>But having shaken off the venomous animal into the fire, he felt no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>However they expected, that he would have swollen, or suddenly fallen down dead: but after having waited a considerable time, seeing no mischief befall him, they changed their minds and said, that he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>And near that place was the estate of the chief man of the island, named Publius, who receiving us into his house, entertained us courteously three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>Now the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and bloody flux; to whom Paul went in, and having prayed, laid his hands on him and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>And when this was done, the rest also in the island who had disorders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>came and were healed, Who likewise honoured us with many honours, and when we departed, put on board such things as were necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the island, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>And arriving at Syracuse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>we tarried there three days, Whence coasting round, we came to Rhegium, and the south wind rising after one day, we came the next to Puteoli:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>Where finding brethren, we were intreated to tarry with them seven days, and so we went toward Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>And the brethren having heard of us, came out thence to meet us, some as far as Appii Forum, and others to the Three Taverns, whom when Paul saw, he thanked God and took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself, with the soldier that kept him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>And after three days, Paul called the chief of the Jews together. And when they were come together, he said to them, Brethren, though I have done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet have I been delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>Who having examined me, were willing to have released me, because there was no cause of death in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But when the Jews opposed it, I was constrained to appeal to Cesar; not that I had any thing to accuse my nation of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>For this cause therefore have I intreated, to see and speak with you; for it is on account of the hope of Israel, that I am bound with this chain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>And they said to him, We have neither received letters from Judea concerning thee, nor hath any of the brethren coming hither, related or spoke any evil of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest; for concerning this sect, we know, that it is every where spoken against.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>And having appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he expounded the kingdom of God, testifying and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning till evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>And some believed the things that were spoken, and some believed not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>And not agreeing with each other, they brake up the assembly, after Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by the prophet Isaiah to your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>Saying, Go to this people and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and with their ears they hear heavily, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.29'>And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, having great debating with each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>And Paul continued two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things that relate to the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom of speech, no man forbidding him.</verse>
