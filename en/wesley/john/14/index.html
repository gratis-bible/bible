And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, that where I am, ye may be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thomas saith to him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest, and how can we know the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus saith, I am the way; and the truth, and the life; no man cometh to the Father, but by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: from henceforth ye have known him, and have seen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Philip saith to him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus saith to him, Have I been so long with you, and hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father: and how sayest thou, Shew us the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Believest thou not, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself; and the Father that dwelleth in me, he doth the works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Believe me, because I am in the Father, and the Father in me; but if not, believe me for the sake of the works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Verily, verily I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works which I do, shall he do also; and greater than these shall he do, because I go to my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified thro' the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Comforter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to remain with you for ever, Even the Spirit of truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him. But ye know him; for he remaineth with you, and shall be in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will not leave you orphans; I come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more: but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me, shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Judas (not Iscariot) saith to him, Lord, how is it, that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered and said to him, If any man love me, he will keep my words; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He that loveth me not, keepeth not my words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These things have I spoken to you, while I remained with you. But the Comforter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and will bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Ye heard me say to you, I go, and come again to you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoyced, because I said, I go to the Father; for my Father is greater than me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now I have told you, before it come to pass, that when it is come to pass, ye may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Hereafter I shall not talk much with with you; for the prince of this world is coming; but he hath nothing in me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, so I do. Arise, let us go hence.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
