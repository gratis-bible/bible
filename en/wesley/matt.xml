      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>And Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Thamar, and Pharez begat Esrom, and Esrom begat Aram;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>And Aram begat Aminadab, and Aminadab begat Naasson, and Naasson begat Salmon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>And Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>And Jesse begat David the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>And David the king begat Solomon, of the wife of Uriah; And Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>And Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Jehoram, and Jehoram begat Uzziah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>And Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>And Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amon, and Amon begat Josiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>And Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begat Salathiel, and Salathiel begat Zerubbabel; And Zerubbabel begat Abiud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>And Azor begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>And Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations: and from David to the Babylonish captivity are fourteen generations, and from the Babylonish captivity to Christ are fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Christ was on this wise: His mother Mary, being espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and yet not willing to make her a publick example, purposed to put her away privily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But while he was thinking on these things, behold an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife; for that which is begotten in her, is of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>(Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>saying, Behold the virgin shall be with child, and bring forth a Son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>But he knew her not, till she had brought forth her Son, the first-born. And he called his name Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold wise men came from the East to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>For we have seen his star in the East, and are come to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And having assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he demanded of them, Where the Christ was to be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea; for thus it is written by the prophet, And thou,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>Bethlehem in the land of Judah, art in no wise the least among the princes of Judah; for out of thee shall come forth a Ruler, who shall feed my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod, having privately called the wise men, inquired of them with great exactness, at what time the star appeared:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go, inquire exactly concerning the young child, and if ye find him, bring me word again, that I also may come and worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>And having heard the king, they departed; and lo the star which they had seen in the East, moved on before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>And seeing the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And being come into the house, they saw the young child, with Mary his mother; and falling down, they worshiped him. And opening their treasures, they presented to him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being warned of God in a dream, not to return to Herod, they went back into their own country another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>And when they were gone back, behold an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and continue there till I shall tell thee; for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>And he arose, and took the young child and his mother by night, and retired into Egypt, And continued there till the death of Herod;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, seeing that he was deluded by the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sending forth, slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the confines thereof, from two years old and under; according to the time which he had exactly inquired of the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>saying, In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But when Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought the young child's life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And he arose and took the young child and his mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>and came into the land of Israel, But having heard, Archelaus reigneth over Judea, in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither, and being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the region of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days cometh John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>And saying, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>And this John had his raiment of camels hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their Sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Ye serpents, ye brood of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>And say not within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father; for I say to you, God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>But even the axe already lieth at the root of the trees; therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I; whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather the wheat into the garner, but will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And Jesus being baptized, went up straightway from the water, and lo the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And lo a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then was Jesus led up by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And having fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterwards hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And the tempter coming to him said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answering said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil taketh him with him into the holy city, and setteth him on the battlement of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>And saith to him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it is written, He shall charge his angels concerning thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again the devil taketh him with him to an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, And saith to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus saith to him, Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil leaveth him, and behold angels came and waited upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>But when Jesus heard, that John was cast into prison, he retired into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt at Capernaum, which is on the sea coast, in the borders of Zebulon and Naphthali: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>saying, The land of Zebulon and the land of Naphthali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>by the way of the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, The people who walked in darkness, saw a great light, and to them who sat in the region of the shadow of death, light is sprung up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he saith to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And straitway leaving the nets they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And going on from thence, he saw two other brethren, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in a vessel with Zebedee their father mending their nets; and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>And leaving the vessel and their father, they immediately followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease, and all manner of malady among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And his fame went thro' all Syria; and they brought to him all sick people, that were seized with divers diseases and tormenting pains; even demoniacs, and lunaticks, and paralytics; and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And there followed him great multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis, and Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain; and when he was set down his disciples came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>And he opened his mouth and taught them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>saying, Happy are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Happy are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Happy are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Happy are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Happy are the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Happy are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Happy are the peace-makers; for they shall be called the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Happy are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Happy are ye when men shall revile and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>Ye are the light of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>A city that is situated on a mountain cannot be hid. Neither do they light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy but to fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For verily I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all things be effected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments and teach men so, shall be the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whosoever shall do and each them, he shall be great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say to you, That unless your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>Ye have heard, that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt do no murder, and whosoever doth murder, shall be liable to the judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be liable to the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the council; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be liable to hell-fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remember, that thy brother hath ought against thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>Leaving thy gift there before the altar, go; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him, lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt in no wise come out thence, till thou hast paid the last farthing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>Ye have heard, that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>But if thy right eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if thy right-hand cause thee to offend, cut it off and cast it from thee; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of Divorce.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say unto you, whosoever shall put away his wife, save for the cause of whoredom, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away, committeth adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Again, ye have heard, that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform thine oaths unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I say unto you, Swear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head; for thou canst not make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your conversation be yea, yea; nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these, cometh of the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say unto you, that ye resist not the evil man: but whosoever shall smite thee on the right-cheek, turn to him the other also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And if a man will sue thee and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And whosoever shall compel thee to go with him one mile, go with him twain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to him that asketh thee, and him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>Ye have heard, that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>That ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>Do not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? Do not even the heathens so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>Therefore ye shall be perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.6'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>Take heed that ye practise not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>Therefore when thou dost alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.24'>And in the evening, he was there alone: but the vessel was now in the midst of the sea, tossed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.26'>And the disciples seeing him walking on the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition: and they cried out for fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.27'>But Jesus immediately spake to them, saying, Take courage: it is I: be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.28'>And Peter answering him said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the water.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.10'>So those servants going out into the highways, gathered together all whomsoever they found, both bad and good. And the feast was abundantly supplied with guests.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.14'>For many are called, but few chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.15'>Then went the Pharisees and consulted, how to insnare him in his talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.16'>And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth; neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.17'>Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.23'>The same day came the Saducees, who say there is no resurrection, and they asked him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>Lord, Is it I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>And he answering said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but wo to that man, by whom the Son of man is betrayed: it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>Then Judas who betrayed him answering said, Master, Is it I? He saith to him, Thou hast said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>And after they had eaten, Jesus took bread and blessed and brake and gave it to his disciples and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>And he took the cup, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>For this is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many, for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>I say to you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, till the day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>And when they had sung the hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then saith Jesus to them, All ye will be offended at me this night, for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>Peter answering said to him, Tho' all should be offended at thee, I will never be offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, before cock-crowing thou wilt deny me thrice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter saith to him, If I must die with thee, yet will I in no wise deny thee. In like manner also said all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then cometh Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and saith to the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and in deep anguish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then saith he to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And going a little farther, he fell on his face and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>And he cometh to the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith to Peter, What! Could ye not watch with me one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing; but the flesh is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again the second time he went away and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup cannot pass from me, unless I drink it, thy will be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And he came and found them asleep again; for their eyes were weighed down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>And leaving them, he went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then cometh he to his disciples and saith to them, Sleep on now and take your rest: Behold the hour is come, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Rise; let us be going: behold he that betrayeth me is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>And while he was yet speaking, lo Judas one of the twelve came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now he that betrayed him, had given them a signal, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, is he; seize him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said, Hail, Master, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>And Jesus said to him, Friend, Wherefore art thou come? Then came they and laid hands on Jesus and took him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And behold one of them that were with Jesus, stretching out his hand, drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then said Jesus to him, Put up again thy sword into its place; for all they that take the sword, shall perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Thinkest thou that I cannot now ask my Father, and he will presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>In that hour Jesus said to the multitude, Are ye come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple and ye took me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this is done, that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>And they that had apprehended Jesus, led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Peter followed him afar off to the high priest's palace, and going in, sat with the officers, to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council sought false witness against Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>to put him to death, But found none; yea, tho' many false witnesses came, yet found they none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>At last came two false witnesses, And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And the high priest rising up said to him, Answerest thou nothing? What do these witness against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answering said to him, I adjure thee by the living God, to tell us, if thou art the Christ, the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus saith to him, Thou hast said. Moreover I say to you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right-hand of power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? Behold now ye have heard his blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What think ye? They answering said, He is guilty of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then did they spit in his face and buffet him, and others smote him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>Saying, Prophesy to us, thou Christ, who is he that smote thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter sat without in the hall. And one of the maid-servants came to him saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied before all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said to them that were there, This fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>And after a while they that stood by, came and said to Peter, Surely thou art also one of them; for thy speech discovereth thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And immediately the cock crew. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who said to him, Before cock-crowing thou wilt deny me thrice. And he went out and wept bitterly.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>And having bound him, they led him away and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Judas who had betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>Saying, I have sinned, in betraying innocent blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And they said, What is that to us? See thou to it. And having thrown down the pieces of silver in the temple, he withdrew and went and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>And the chief priests taking the pieces of silver, said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>And having consulted together, they bought with them the potters field, to bury foreigners in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>And gave them for the potters field, as the Lord commanded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>And Jesus stood before the governour. And the governour questioned him, saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, Thou sayest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then said Pilate to him, Hearest thou not, how many things they witness against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>And he answered him to never a word, so that the governour marvelled greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now at the feast the governour was wont to release to the people a prisoner, whom they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>And they had then a notorious prisoner, named Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom will ye that I release to you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>While he sat on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things to-day in a dream because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude, to ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>The governour answering said to them, Which of the two will ye that I release to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>They say, Barabbas. Pilate saith to them, What shall I do then with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all say to him, Let him be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>And the governour said, Why, what evil hath he done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. Then Pilate, seeing, that he could prevail nothing, but rather a tumult was made, took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just man: see ye to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>Then all the people answering said, His blood be on us and on our children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then released he Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the governour, taking Jesus into the common hall, gathered to him the whole troop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>And they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a cane in his right-hand; and kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And spitting on him, they took the cane and smote him on the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And after they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And coming out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And coming to a place called Golgotha, that is, the place of a skull, They gave him vinegar mingled with gall to drink,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And they crucified him and parted his garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and for my vesture they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And sitting down, they guarded him there, And set up over his head his accusation written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then were two thieves crucified with him, one on the right-hand and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>And they that were passing by reviled him, wagging their heads and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son God, come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>In like manner the chief priests also with the scribes and elders mocking him said, He saved others; Cannot he save himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>If he be the king of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God: let him deliver him now if he will have him; for he said, I am the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>And even the robbers that were crucified with him, cast the same reproach upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the earth, unto the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama-sabachthani? That is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>Some of them that stood there hearing it, said, He calleth Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>And immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge filled it with vinegar, and put it on a cane, and gave him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>The rest said, Let be: let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>Jesus after he had cried again with a loud voice, dismissed his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom, and the earth was shaken and the rocks were torn asunder: And the tombs were opened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>and many bodies of holy men that slept were raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, went into the holy city, and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>And the centurion and they that were with him, guarding Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things that were done, feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>And many women were there, beholding afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>Among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>When the evening was come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>He going to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus: then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>And Joseph taking the body, wrapped it in clean linen, And laid it in his own new tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>which he had hewn out in the rock, and having rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>And Mary Magdalene was there and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>Now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>Saying, Sir, we remember, that impostor said while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Command therefore that the sepulchre be secured till the third day, lest his disciples coming steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last imposture shall be worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, Ye have a guard; go, make it as secure as ye can.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went and secured the sepulchre, sealing the stone, and setting a guard.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>Now after the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And behold, there had been a great earthquake, and an angel of the Lord descending from heaven, had come and rolled away the stone from the door and sat upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>And for fear of him the guards trembled, and became as dead men.</verse>
