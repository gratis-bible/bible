        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>The vision of Isaias the son of Amos I which he saw concerning Juda and Jerusalem in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken. I have brought up children, and exalted them: but they have despised me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not understood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>Woe to the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a wicked seed, ungracious children: they have forsaken the Lord, they have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backwards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>For what shall I strike you any more, you that increase transgression? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart is sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no soundness therein: wounds and bruises and swelling sores: they are not bound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your land is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire: your country strangers devour before your face, and it shall be desolate as when wasted by enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>And the daughter of Sion shall be left as a covert in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, and as a city that is laid waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>Except the Lord of hosts had left us seed, we had been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your victims, saith the Lord? I am full, I desire not holocausts of rams, and fat of fatlings, and blood of calves, and lambs, and buck goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>When you came to appear before me, who required these things at your hands, that you should walk in my courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>Offer sacrifice no more in vain: incense is an abomination tome. The new moons, and the sabbaths, and other festivals I will not abide, your assemblies are wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>My soul hateth your new moons, and your solemnities: they are become troublesome to me, I am weary of bearing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>And when you stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my eyes from you: and when you multiply prayer, I will not hear: for your hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>Wash yourselves, be clean, take away the evil of your devices from my eyes: cease to do perversely,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>Learn to do well: seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge for the fatherless, defend the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>And then come, and accuse me, saith the Lord: if your sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow: and if they be red as crimson, they shall be white as wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'>if you be willing, and will hearken to me, you shall eat the good things of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'>But if you will not, and will provoke me to wrath: the sword shall devour you because the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'>How is the faithful city, that was full of judgment, become a harlot? justice dwelt in it, but now murderers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Thy silver is turned into dress: thy wine is mingled with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>Thy princes are faithless, companions of thieves: they all love bribes, the run after rewards. They judge not for the fatherless: and the widow's cometh not in to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>Therefore saith the Lord the God of hosts, the mighty one of Israel: Ah! I will comfort myself over my adversaries: and I will be revenged of my enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>And I will turn my hand to thee, and I will clean purge away thy dress, and I will take away all thy tin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>And I will restore thy judges se they were before, and thy counsellors as of old. After this thou shalt be called the city of the just, a faithful city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Sion shall be redeemed in judgment, and they shall bring her back in justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>And he shall destroy the wicked, and the sinners together: and they that have forsaken the Lord, shall be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>For they shall be confounded for the idols, to which they have sacrificed: and you shall be ashamed of the gardens which you have chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>When you shall be as an oak with the leaves falling off, and as a garden without water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>And your strength shall be as the ashes of tow, and your work as a spark: and both shall burn together, and there shall be none to quench it.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'>The word that Isaias the son of Amos saw, concerning Juda and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'>And in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be prepared on the top of mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'>And many people shall go, and say: Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall come forth from Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>And he shall judge the Gentiles, and rebuke many people: and they shall turn their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they be exercised any more to war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>For thou hast cast off thy people, the house of Jacob: because they are filled as in times past, and have had soothsayers as the Philistines, and have adhered to strange children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'>Their land is filled with silver and gold: and there is no end of their treasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>And their land is filled with horses: and their chariots are innumerable. Their land also is full of idols: they have adored the work of their own hands, which their own fingers have made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>And man hath bowed himself down, and man hath been debased: therefore forgive them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Enter thou into the rock, and hide thee in the pit from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The lofty eyes of man are humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be made to stoop: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>Because the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and highminded, and upon every one that is arrogant, and he shall be humbled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>And upon all the tall and lofty cedars of Libanus, and upon all the oaks of Basan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the elevated hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>And upon every high tower, and every fenced wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>And upon all the ships of Tharsis, and upon all that is fair to behold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'>And the loftiness of men shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be humbled, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'>And idols shall be utterly destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'>And they shall go into the holes of rocks, and into the caves of the earth from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'>In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which he had made for himself to adore, moles and bats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'>,21And he shall go into the clefts of rocks, and into the holes of stones from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'>Cease ye therefore from the man, whose breath is in his nostrils, for he is reputed high.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'>For behold the sovereign the Lord of hosts shall take away from Jerusalem, and from Juda the valiant and the strong, the whole strength of bread, and the whole strength of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'>The strong man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the cunning man, and the ancient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'>The captain over fifty, and the honourable in countenance, and the counsellor, and the architect, and the skilful in eloquent speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'>And I will give children to be their princes, and the effeminate shall rule over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'>And the people shall rush one upon another, and every man against his neighbour: the child shall make it tumult against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'>For a man shall take hold or his brother, one of the house of his father, saying: Thou hast a garment, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'>In that day he shall answer, saying: I am no healer, and in my house there is no bread, nor clothing: make me not ruler of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Juda is fallen: because their tongue, and their devices are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'>The shew of their countenance hath answered them: and they have proclaimed abroad their sin as Sodom, and they have not hid it: woe to their souls, for evils are rendered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'>Say to the just man that it is well, for he shall eat the fruit of his doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'>Woe to the wicked unto evil: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>As for my people, their oppressors have stripped them, and women have ruled over them. O my people, they that call thee blessed, the same deceive thee, and destroy the way of thy steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'>The Lord standeth up to judge, and he standeth to judge the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'>The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and its princes: for you have devoured the vineyard, and the spoil of the poor is in your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'>Why do you consume my people, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord the God of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'>And the Lord said: Because the daughters of Sion are haughty, and have walked with stretched out necks, and wanton glances of their eyes, and made a noise as they walked with their feet and moved in a set pace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'>The Lord will make bald the crown of the head of the daughters of Sion, and the Lord will discover their hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'>In that day the Lord will take away the ornaments of shoes, end little moons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'>And chains and necklaces, and bracelets, and bonnets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'>And bodkins, and ornaments of the legs, and tablets, and sweet balls, and earrings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'>And rings, and jewels hanging on the forehead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.22'>And changes of apparel, and short cloaks, and fine linen, and crisping pins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'>And looking-glasses, and lawns, and headbands, and fine veils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'>And instead of a sweet smell there shall be stench, and instead of a girdle, a cord, and instead of curled hair, baldness, and instead of a stomacher, haircloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'>Thy fairest men also shall fall by the sword, and thy valiant ones in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'>And her gates shall lament and mourn, and she shall sit desolate on the ground.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'>And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying: We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, take away our reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'>In that day the bud of the Lord shall be in magnificence and glory, and the fruit of the earth shall be high, and a great joy to them that shall have escaped of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'>And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall be left in Sion, and that shall remain in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, every one that is written in life in Jerusalem.</verse>
