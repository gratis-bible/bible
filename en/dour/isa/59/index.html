We looked for light, and behold darkness: brightness, and we have walked in the dark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We have groped for the wall, and like the blind we have groped as if we had no eyes: we have stumbled at noonday as in darkness, we are in dark places as dead men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We shall roar all of us like bears, and shall lament as mournful doves. We have looked for judgment, and there is none: for salvation, and it is far from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For our iniquities are multiplied before thee, and our sins have testified against us: for our wicked doings are with us, and we have known our iniquities:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In sinning and lying against the Lord: and we have turned away so that we went not after our God, but spoke calumny and transgression : we have conceived, and uttered from the heart, words of falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And judgment is turned away backward, and justice hath stood far off: because truth bath fallen down in the street, and equity could not come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And truth hath been forgotten: and he that departed from evil, lay open to be a prey: and the Lord saw, and it appeared evil in his eyes, because there is no judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he saw that there is not a man: and he stood astonished, because there is none to oppose himself: and his own arm brought salvation to him, and his own justice supported him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He put on justice as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head: he put on the garments of vengeance, and was clad with zeal as with a cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As unto revenge, as it were to repay wrath to his adversaries, and a reward to his enemies: he will repay the like to the islands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they from the west, shall fear the name of the Lord: and they from the rising of the sun, his glory: when he shall come as a violent stream, which the spirit of the Lord driveth on:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there shall come a, redeemer to Sion, and to them that return from iniquity in Jacob, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is my covenant with them, saith the Lord: My spirit that is in thee, and my words that I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
