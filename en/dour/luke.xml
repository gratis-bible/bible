  <div type='book' osisID='Luke'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a narration of the things that have been accomplished among us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>According as they have delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>It seemed good to me also, having diligently attained to all things from the beginning, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>That thou mayest know the verity of those words in which thou hast been instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zachary, of the course of Abia; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both just before God, walking in all the commandments and justifications of the Lord without blame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>And they had no son, for that Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>And it came to pass, when he executed the priestly function in the order of his course before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>According to the custom of the priestly office, it was his lot to offer incense, going into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And all the multitude of the people was praying without, at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the alter of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And Zachary seeing him, was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him: Fear not, Zachary, for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice in his nativity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he shall be great before the Lord; and shall drink no wine nor strong drink: and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And he shall convert many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias; that he may turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children, and the incredulous to the wisdom of the just, to prepare unto the Lord a perfect people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zachary said to the angel: Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answering, said to him: I am Gabriel, who stand before God: and am sent to speak to thee, and to bring thee these good tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And behold, thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be able to speak until the day wherein these things shall come to pass, because thou hast not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people were waiting for Zachary; and they wondered that he tarried so long in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they understood that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he made signs to them, and remained dumb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And it came to pass, after the days of his office were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>And after those days, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and hid herself five months, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he hath had regard to take away my reproach among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And the angel being come in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>Who having heard, was troubled at his saying, and thought with herself what manner of salutation this should be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the most High; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father; and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And of his kingdom there shall be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>And Mary said to the angel: How shall this be done, because I know not man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answering, said to her: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And behold thy cousin Elizabeth, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her that is called barren:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>Because no word shall be impossible with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it done to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>And Mary rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste into a city of Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>And she entered into the house of Zachary, and saluted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>And she cried out with a loud voice, and said: Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid; for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me; and holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that fear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He hath shewed might in his arm: he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of his mercy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary abode with her about three months; and she returned to her own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now Elizabeth's full time of being delivered was come, and she brought forth a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbours and kinsfolks heard that the Lord had shewed his great mercy towards her, and they congratulated with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him by his father's name Zachary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother answering, said: Not so; but he shall be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said to her: There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And demanding a writing table, he wrote, saying: John is his name. And they all wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came upon all their neighbours; and all these things were noised abroad over all the hill country of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all they that had heard them laid them up in their heart, saying: What an one, think ye, shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And Zachary his father was filled with the Holy Ghost; and he prophesied, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>And hath raised up an horn of salvation to us, in the house of David his servant:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who are from the beginning:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>To perform mercy to our fathers, and to remember his holy testament,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>The oath, which he swore to Abraham our father, that he would grant to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>That being delivered from the hand of our enemies, we may serve him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>In holiness and justice before him, all our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>To give knowledge of salvation to his people, unto the remission of their sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Through the bowels of the mercy of our God, in which the Orient from on high hath visited us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>To enlighten them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: to direct our feet into the way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit; and was in the deserts until the day of his manifestation to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>And it came to pass, that in those days there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that the whole world should be enrolled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This enrolling was first made by Cyrinus, the governor of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And all went to be enrolled, every one into his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem: because he was of the house and family of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>To be enrolled with Mary his espoused wife, who was with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And it came to pass, that when they were there, her days were accomplished, that she should be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him up in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And there were in the same country shepherds watching, and keeping the night watches over their flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And behold an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the brightness of God shone round about them; and they feared with a great fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the angel said to them: Fear not; for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, that shall be to all the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>For, this day, is born to you a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this shall be a sign unto you. You shall find the infant wrapped in swaddling clothes, and laid in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God, and saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>Glory to God in the highest; and on earth peace to men of good will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And it came to pass, after the angels departed from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another: Let us go over to Bethlehem, and let us see this word that is come to pass, which the Lord hath shewed to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came with haste; and they found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And seeing, they understood of the word that had been spoken to them concerning this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all that heard, wondered; and at those things that were told them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary kept all these words, pondering them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God, for all the things they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And after eight days were accomplished, that the child should be circumcised, his name was called JESUS, which was called by the angel, before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And after the days of her purification, according to the law of Moses, were accomplished, they carried him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>As it is written in the law of the Lord: Every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>And to offer a sacrifice, according as it is written in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And behold there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, and this man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Ghost was in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Christ of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>And he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when his parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>He also took him into his arms, and blessed God, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>Now thou dost dismiss thy servant, O Lord, according to thy word in peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>Because my eyes have seen thy salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>A light to the revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And his father and mother were wondering at those things which were spoken concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother: Behold this child is set for the fall, and for the resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be contradicted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>And thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that, out of many hearts, thoughts may be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; she was far advanced in years, and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>And she was a widow until fourscore and four years; who departed not from the temple, by fastings and prayers serving night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>Now she, at the same hour, coming in, confessed to the Lord; and spoke of him to all that looked for the redemption of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And after they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their city Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the child grew, and waxed strong, full of wisdom; and the grace of God was in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>And his parents went every year to Jerusalem, at the solemn day of the pasch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when he was twelve years old, they going up into Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>And having fulfilled the days, when they returned, the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>And thinking that he was in the company, they came a day's journey, and sought him among their kinsfolks and acquaintance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>And not finding him, they returned into Jerusalem, seeking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them, and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom and his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And seeing him, they wondered. And his mother said to him: Son, why hast thou done so to us? behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And he said to them: How is it that you sought me? did you not know, that I must be about my father's business?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>And they understood not the word that he spoke unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these words in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and age, and grace with God and men.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother tetrarch of Iturea, and the country of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilina;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>Under the high priests Annas and Caiphas; the word of the Lord was made unto John, the son of Zachary, in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he came into all the country about the Jordan, preaching the baptism of penance for the remission of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>As it was written in the book of the sayings of Isaias the prophet: A voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley shall be filled; and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight; and the rough ways plain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>He said therefore to the multitudes that went forth to be baptized by him: Ye offspring of vipers, who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of penance; and do not begin to say, We have Abraham for our father. For I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>And the people asked him, saying: What then shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>And he answering, said to them: He that hath two coats, let him give to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>And the publicans also came to be baptized, and said to him: Master, what shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>But he said to them: Do nothing more than that which is appointed you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>And the soldiers also asked him, saying: And what shall we do? And he said to them: Do violence to no man; neither calumniate any man; and be content with your pay.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>And going into one of the ships that was Simon's, he desired him to draw back a little from the land. And sitting he taught the multitudes out of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>Now when he had ceased to speak, he said to Simon: Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>And Simon answering said to him: Master, we have labored all the night, and have taken nothing: but at thy word I will let down the net.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And when they had done this, they enclosed a very great multitude of fishes, and their net broke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>And they beckoned to their partners that were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they were almost sinking.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>And he charged him that he should tell no man, but, Go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But the fame of him went abroad the more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>And he retired into the desert, and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>And it came to pass on a certain day, as he sat teaching, that there were also Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, that were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was to heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And behold, men brought in a bed a man, who had the palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in, because of the multitude, they went up upon the roof, and let him down through the tiles with his bed into the midst before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>Whose faith when he saw, he said: Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the scribes and Pharisees began to think, saying: Who is this who speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>And Levi made him a great feast in his own house; and there was a great company of publicans, and of others, that were at table with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>But the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying to his disciples: Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>And Jesus answering, said to them: They that are whole, need not the physician: but they that are sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I came not to call the just, but sinners to penance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>And they said to him: Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and the disciples of the Pharisees in like manner; but thine eat and drink?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.49'>But he that heareth, and doth not, is like to a man building his house upon the earth without a foundation: against which the stream beat vehemently, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>And when he had finished all his words in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capharnaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>And the servant of a certain centurion, who was dear to him, being sick, was ready to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>And when he had heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the ancients of the Jews, desiring him to come and heal his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And when they came to Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying to him: He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>For he loveth our nation; and he hath built us a synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent his friends to him, saying: Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>For which cause neither did I think myself worthy to come to thee; but say the word, and my servant shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I also am a man subject to authority, having under me soldiers: and I say to one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>Which Jesus hearing, marvelled: and turning about to the multitude that followed him, he said: Amen I say to you, I have not found so great faith, not even in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And they who were sent, being returned to the house, found the servant whole who had been sick.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>And he that was dead, sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>And there came a fear on them all: and they glorified God, saying: A great prophet is risen up among us: and, God hath visited his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judea, and throughout all the country round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>And John's disciples told him of all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>And John called to him two of his disciples, and sent them to Jesus, saying: Art thou he that art to come; or look we for another?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>(And in that same hour, he cured many of their diseases, and hurts, and evil spirits: and to many that were blind he gave sight.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>And answering, he said to them: Go and relate to John what you have heard and seen: the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, to the poor the gospel is preached:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And blessed is he whosoever shall not be scandalized in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak to the multitudes concerning John. What went ye out into the desert to see? a reed shaken with the wind?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>And it came to pass afterwards, that he travelled through the cities and towns, preaching and evangelizing the kingdom of God; and the twelve with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities; Mary who is called Magdalen, out of whom seven devils were gone forth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>And Joanna the wife of Chusa, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others who ministered unto him of their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And when a very great multitude was gathered together, and hastened out of the cities unto him, he spoke by a similitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>The sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>And other some fell upon a rock: and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And other some fell among thorns, and the thorns growing up with it, choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>And other some fell upon good ground; and being sprung up, yielded fruit a hundredfold. Saying these things, he cried out: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And his disciples asked him what this parable might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>To whom he said: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to the rest in parables, that seeing they may not see, and hearing may not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>And they by the way side are they that hear; then the devil cometh, and taketh the word out of their heart, lest believing they should be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>Now they upon the rock, are they who when they hear, receive the word with joy: and these have no roots; for they believe for a while, and in time of temptation, they fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>And that which fell among thorns, are they who have heard, and going their way, are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and yield no fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But that on the good ground, are they who in a good and perfect heart, hearing the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit in patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>Now no man lighting a candle covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it upon a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>Who answering, said to them: My mother and my brethren are they who hear the word of God, and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>And it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a little ship with his disciples, and he said to them: Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>And when they were sailing, he slept; and there came down a storm of wind upon the lake, and they were filled, and were in danger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>And they came and awaked him, saying: Master, we perish. But he arising, rebuked the wind and the rage of the water; and it ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>And he said to them: Where is your faith? Who being afraid, wondered, saying one to another: Who is this, (think you), that he commandeth both the winds and the sea, and they obey him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>And they sailed to the country of the Gerasens, which is over against Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>And when he was come forth to the land, there met him a certain man who had a devil now a very long time, and he wore no clothes, neither did he abide in a house, but in the sepulchres.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>And when he saw Jesus, he fell down before him; and crying out with a loud voice, he said: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I beseech thee, do not torment me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For he commanded the unclean spirit to go out of the man. For many times it seized him, and he was bound with chains, and kept in fetters; and breaking the bonds, he was driven by the devil into the deserts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>And Jesus asked him, saying: What is thy name? But he said: Legion; because many devils were entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they besought him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain; and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>The devils therefore went out of the man, and entered into the swine; and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were stifled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>Which when they that fed them saw done, they fled away, and told it in the city and in the villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>And they went out to see what was done; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at his feet, clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>And they also that had seen, told them how he had been healed from the legion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>And all the multitude of the country of the Gerasens besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear. And he, going up into the ship, returned back again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>Now the man, out of whom the devils were departed, besought him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>Return to thy house, and tell how great things God hath done to thee. And he went through the whole city, publishing how great things Jesus had done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>And it came to pass, that when Jesus was returned, the multitude received him: for they were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And behold there came a man whose name was Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at the feet of Jesus, beseeching him that he would come into his house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>For he had an only daughter, almost twelve years old, and she was dying. And it happened as he went, that he was thronged by the multitudes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>And there was a certain woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had bestowed all her substance on physicians, and could not be healed by any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>She came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment; and immediately the issue of her blood stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jesus said: Who is it that touched me? And all denying, Peter and they that were with him said: Master, the multitudes throng and press thee, and dost thou say, Who touched me?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>And the woman seeing that she was not hid, came trembling, and fell down before his feet, and declared before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was immediately healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>But he said to her: Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go thy way in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>As he was yet speaking, there cometh one to the ruler of the synagogue, saying to him: Thy daughter is dead, trouble him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>And Jesus hearing this word, answered the father of the maid: Fear not; believe only, and she shall be safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>And when he was come to the house, he suffered not any man to go in with him, but Peter and James and John, and the father and mother of the maiden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>And all wept and mourned for her. But he said: Weep not; the maid is not dead, but sleepeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But he taking her by the hand, cried out, saying: Maid, arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And he bid them give her to eat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Now Herod, the tetrarch, heard of all things that were done by him; and he was in a doubt, because it was said</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>Which when the people knew, they followed him; and he received them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and healed them who had need of healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>Now the day began to decline. And the twelve came and said to him: Send away the multitude, that going into the towns and villages round about, they may lodge and get victuals; for we are here in a desert place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>But he said to them: Give you them to eat. And they said: We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; unless perhaps we should go and buy food for all this multitude.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>And as he spoke these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them; and they were afraid, when they entered into the cloud.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women, who bewailed and lamented him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus turning to them, said: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not over me; but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For behold, the days shall come, wherein they will say: Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the paps that have not given suck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains: Fall upon us; and to the hills: Cover us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if in the green wood they do these things, what shall be done in the dry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified him there; and the robbers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. But they, dividing his garments, cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people stood beholding, and the rulers with them derided him, saying: He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the elect of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>And saying: If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And there was also a superscription written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>And one of those robbers who were hanged, blasphemed him, saying: If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Neither dost thou fear God, seeing thou art condemned under the same condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done no evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said to Jesus: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, this day thou shalt be with me in paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>And it was almost the sixth hour; and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And Jesus crying out with a loud voice, said: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And saying this, he gave up the ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>Now the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying: Indeed this was a just man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the multitude of them that were come together to that sight, and saw the things that were done, returned striking their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And all his acquaintance, and the women that had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And behold there was a man named Joseph, who was a counsellor, a good and just man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(The same had not consented to their counsel and doings;) of Arimathea, a city of Judea; who also himself looked for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And taking him down, he wrapped him in fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that was hewed in stone, wherein never yet any man had been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And it was the day of the Parasceve, and the sabbath drew on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women that were come with him from Galilee, following after, saw the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>And returning, they prepared spices and ointments; and on the sabbath day they rested, according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>And they found the stone rolled back from the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>And going in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it came to pass, as they were astonished in their mind at this, behold, two men stood by them, in shining apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their countenance towards the ground, they said unto them: Why seek you the living with the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke unto you, when he was in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>Saying: The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>And going back from the sepulchre, they told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>And it was Mary Magdalen, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the other women that were with them, who told these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And these words seemed to them as idle tales; and they did not believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Peter rising up, ran to the sepulchre, and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths laid by themselves; and went away wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, named Emmaus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>And it came to pass, that while they talked and reasoned with themselves, Jesus himself also drawing near, went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were held, that they should not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said to them: What are these discourses that you hold one with another as you walk, and are sad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, said to him: Art thou only a stranger to Jerusalem, and hast not known the things that have been done there in these days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>To whom he said: What things? And they said: Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in work and word before God and all the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>And how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we hoped, that it was he that should have redeemed Israel: and now besides all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>Yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us, who before it was light, were at the sepulchre,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>And not finding his body, came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who say that he is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And some of our people went to the sepulchre, and found it so as the women had said, but him they found not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Then he said to them: O foolish, and slow of heart to believe in all things which the prophets have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and so to enter into his glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures, the things that were concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they drew night to the town, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go farther.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they constrained him; saying: Stay with us, because it is towards evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it came to pass, whilst he was at table with them, he took bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him: and he vanished out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said one to the other: Was not our heart burning within us, whilst he spoke in this way, and opened to us the scriptures?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And rising up, the same hour, they went back to Jerusalem: and they found the eleven gathered together, and those that were staying with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>Saying: The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they told what things were done in the way; and how they knew him in the breaking of the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>Now whilst they were speaking these things, Jesus stood in the midst of them, and saith to them: Peace be to you; it is I, fear not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But they being troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>See my hands and feet, that it is I myself; handle, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me to have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>But while they yet believed not, and wondered for joy, he said: Have you any thing to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>And they offered him a piece of a broiled fish, and a honeycomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>And when he had eaten before them, taking the remains, he gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said to them: These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>And he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead, the third day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>And that penance and remission of sins should be preached in his name, unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>And you are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And I send the promise of my Father upon you: but stay you in the city till you be endued with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he led them out as far as Bethania: and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it came to pass, whilst he blessed them, he departed from them, and was carried up to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And they adoring went back into Jerusalem with great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>And they were always in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</verse>
