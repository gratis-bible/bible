And he divided unto them his substance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all together, went abroad into a far country: and there wasted his substance, living riotously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into his farm to feed swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat; and no man gave unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And returning to himself, he said: How many hired servants in my father's house abound with bread, and I here perish with hunger?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will arise, and will go to my father, and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am not worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And rising up he came to his father. And when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and running to him fell upon his neck, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the son said to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, I am not now worthy to be called thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the father said to his servants: Bring forth quickly the first robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and make merry:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Because this my son was dead, and is come to life again: was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now his elder son was in the field, and when he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him: Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was angry, and would not go in. His father therefore coming out began to entreat him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee, and I have never transgressed thy commandment, and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me, and all I have is thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
