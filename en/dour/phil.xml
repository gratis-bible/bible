  <div type='book' osisID='Phil'>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ; to all the saints in Christ Jesus, who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I give thanks to my God in every remembrance of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>Always in all my prayers making supplication for you all, with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>For your communication in the gospel of Christ from the first day until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>Being confident of this very thing, that he, who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>As it is meet for me to think this for you all, for that I have you in my heart; and that in my bands, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>And this I pray, that your charity may more and more abound in knowledge, and in all understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>That you may approve the better things, that you may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>Filled with the fruit of justice, through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>Now, brethren, I desire you should know, that the things which have happened to me, have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>So that my bands are made manifest in Christ, in all the court, and in all other places;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>And many of the brethren in the Lord, growing confident by my bands, are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some indeed, even out of envy and contention; but some also for good will preach Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>Some out of charity, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>And some out of contention preach Christ not sincerely: supposing that they raise affliction to my bands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>But what then? So that by all means, whether by occasion, or by truth, Christ be preached: in this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>For I know that this shall fall out to me unto salvation, through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>According to my expectation and hope; that in nothing I shall be confounded, but with all confidence, as always, so now also shall Christ be magnified in my body, wither it be by life, or by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For to me, to live is Christ; and to die is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>And if to live in the flesh, that is to me the fruit of labour, and what I shall choose I know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>But I am straitened between two: having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, a thing by far the better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>But to abide still in the flesh, is needful for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, and continue with you all, for your furtherance and joy of faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>That your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me, by my coming to you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you, or, being absent, may hear of you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>And in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries: which to them is a cause of perdition, but to you of salvation, and this from God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>For unto you it is given for Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>Having the same conflict as that which you have seen in me, and now have heard of me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of charity, if any society of the spirit, if any bowels of commiseration:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>Fulfil ye my joy, that you may be of one mind, having the same charity, being of one accord, agreeing in sentiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>Let nothing be done through contention, neither by vain glory: but in humility, let each esteem others better than themselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>Each one not considering the things that are his own, but those that are other men's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>For which cause God also hath exalted him, and hath given him a name which is above all names:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but much more now in my absence,) with fear and trembling work out your salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according to his good will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>And do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>That you may be blameless, and sincere children of God, without reproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation; among whom you shine as lights in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>Holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of Christ, because I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>Yea, and if I be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and congratulate with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>And for the selfsame thing do you also rejoice, and congratulate with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy unto you shortly, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I have no man so of the same mind, who with sincere affection is solicitous for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For all seek the things that are their own; not the things that are Jesus Christ's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>Now know ye the proof of him, that as a son with the father, so hath he served with me in the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Him therefore I hope to send unto you immediately, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>And I trust in the Lord, that I myself also shall come to you shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow labourer, and fellow soldier, but your apostle, and he that hath ministered to my wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>For indeed he longed after you all: and was sad, for that you had heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him; and not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>Therefore I sent him the more speedily: that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord; and treat with honour such as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death: delivering his life, that he might fulfil that which on your part was wanting towards my service.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not wearisome, but to you it is necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For we are the circumcision, who in spirit serve God; and glory in Christ Jesus, not having confidence in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other thinketh he may have confidence in the flesh, I more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>Being circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; according to the law, a Pharisee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>According to zeal, persecuting the church of God; according to the justice that is in the law, conversing without blame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But the things that were gain to me, the same I have counted loss for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>Furthermore I count all things to be but loss for the excellent knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord; for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but as dung, that I may gain Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>And may be found in him, not having my justice, which is of the law, but that which is of the faith of Christ Jesus, which is of God, justice in faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>If by any means I may attain to the resurrection which is from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not as though I has already attained, or were already perfect; but I follow after, if I may by any means apprehend, wherein I am also apprehended by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended. But one thing I do: forgetting the things that are behind, and stretching forth myself to those that are before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I press towards the mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded; and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, this also God will reveal to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>Nevertheless whereunto we are come, that we be of the same mind, let us also continue in the same rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Be ye followers of me, brethren, and observe them who walk so as you have our model.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>For many walk, of whom I have told you often (and now tell you weeping), that they are enemies of the cross of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>Whose end is destruction; whose God is their belly; and whose glory is in their shame; who mind earthly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>But our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>Who will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of his glory, according to the operation whereby also he is able to subdue all things unto himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>Therefore, my dearly beloved brethren, and most desired, my joy and my crown; so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I beg of Evodia, and I beseech Syntyche, to be of one mind in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>And I entreat thee also, my sincere companion, help those women who have laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement and the rest of my fellow labourers, whose names are in the book of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in the Lord always; again, I say, rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let your modesty be known to all men. The Lord is nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>Be nothing solicitous; but in every thing, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>And the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever modest, whatsoever just, whatsoever holy, whatsoever lovely, whatsoever of good fame, if there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline, think on these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>The things which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these do ye, and the God of peace shall be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>Now I rejoice in the Lord exceedingly, that now at length your thought for me hath flourished again, as you did also think; but you were busied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>I speak not as it were for want. For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content therewith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know both how to be brought low, and I know how to abound: (everywhere, and in all things I am instructed) both to be full, and to be hungry; both to abound, and to suffer need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I can do all these things in him who strengtheneth me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>Nevertheless you have done well in communicating to my tribulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>And you also know, O Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>For unto Thessalonica also you sent once and again for my use.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that may abound to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>But I have all, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things you sent, an odour of sweetness, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>And may my God supply all your want, according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>Now to God and our Father be glory world without end. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>The brethren who are with me, salute you. All the saints salute you; especially they that are of Caesar's household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
