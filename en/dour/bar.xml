      <chapter osisID='Bar.1'>
        <verse osisID='Bar.1.1'>Now Arphaxad king of the Medes had brought many nations under his dominions, and he built a very strong city, which he called Ecbatana,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.1.2'>Of stones squared and hewed: he made the walls thereof seventy cubits broad, and thirty cubits high, and the towers thereof he made a hundred cubits high. But on the square of them, each side was extended the space of twenty feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.1.3'>And he made the gates thereof according to the height of the towers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.1.4'>And he gloried as a mighty one in the force of his army and in the glory of his chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.1.5'>Now in the twelfth year of his reign, Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, who reigned in Ninive the great city, fought against Arphaxad and overcame him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.1.6'>In the great plain which is called Ragua, about the Euphrates, and the Tigris, and the Jadason, in the plain of Erioch the king of the Elicians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.1.7'>Then was the kingdom of Nabuchodonosor exalted, and his heart was elevated: and he sent to all that dwelt in Cilicia and Damascus, and Libanus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.1.8'>And to the nations that are in Carmelus, and Cedar, and to the inhabitants of Galilee in the great plain of Asdrelon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.1.9'>And to all that were in Samaria, and beyond the river Jordan even to Jerusalem, and all the land of Jesse till you come to the borders of Ethiopia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.1.10'>To all these Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, sent messengers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.1.11'>But they all with one mind refused, and sent them back empty, and rejected them without honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.1.12'>Then king Nabuchodonosor being angry against all that land, swore by his throne and kingdom that he would revenge himself of all those countries.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Bar.2'>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.1'>In the thirteenth year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, the two and twentieth day of the first month, the word was given out in the house of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, that he would revenge himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.2'>And he called all the ancients, and all the governors, and his officers of war, and communicated to them the secret of his counsel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.3'>And he said that his thoughts were to bring all the earth under his empire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.4'>And when this saying pleased them all, Nabuchodonosor, the king, called Holofernes the general of his armies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.5'>And said to him: Go out against all the kingdoms of the west, and against them especially that despised my commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.6'>Thy eye shall not spare any kingdom, and all the strong cities thou shalt bring under my yoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.7'>Then Holofernes called the captains and officers of the power of the Assyrians: and he mustered men for the expedition, as the king commanded him, a hundred and twenty thousand fighting men on foot, and twelve thousand archers, horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.8'>And he made all his warlike preparations to go before with a multitude of innumerable camels, with all provisions sufficient for the armies in abundance, and herds of oxen, and flocks of sheep, without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.9'>He appointed corn to be prepared out of all Syria in his passage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.10'>But gold and silver he took out of the king's house in great abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.11'>And he went forth he and all the army, with the chariots, and horsemen, and archers, who covered the face of the earth, like locusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.12'>And when he had passed through the borders of the Assyrians, he came to the great mountains of Ange, which are on the left of Cilicia: and he went up to all their castles, and took all the strong places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.13'>And he took by assault the renowned city of Melothus, and pillaged all the children of Tharsis, and the children of Ismahel, who were over against the face of the desert, and on the south of the land of Cellon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.14'>And he passed over the Euphrates and came into Mesopotamia: and he forced all the stately cities that were there, from the torrent of Mambre, till one comes to the sea:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.15'>And he took the borders thereof from Cilicia to the coasts of Japheth, which are towards the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.16'>And he carried away all the children of Madian, and stripped them of all their riches, and all that resisted him he slew with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.17'>And after these things he went down into the plains of Damascus in the days of the harvest, and he set all the corn on fire, and he caused all the trees and vineyards to be cut down</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.18'>And the fear of them fell upon alit the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Bar.3'>
        <verse osisID='Bar.3.1'>Then the kings and the princes of all the cities and provinces, of Syria, Mesopotamia, and Syria Sobal, and Libya, and Cilicia sent their ambassadors, who coming to Holofernes, said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.3.2'>Let thy indignation towards us cease: for it is better for us to live and serve Nabuchodonosor the great king, and be subject to thee, than to die and to perish, or suffer the miseries of slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.3.3'>All our cities and our possessions, all mountains and hills, and fields, and herds of oxen, and flocks of cheep, and goats, and horses, and camels, and all our goods, and families are in thy sight:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.3.4'>Let all we have be subject to thy law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.3.5'>Both we and our children are thy servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.3.6'>Come to us a peaceable lord, and use our service as it shall please thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.3.7'>Then he came down from the mountains with horsemen, in great power, and made himself master of every city, and all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.3.8'>And from all the cities he took auxiliaries valiant men, and chosen for war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.3.9'>And so great a fear lay upon all those provinces, that the inhabitants of all the cities, both princes and nobles, as well as the people, went out to meet him at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.3.10'>And received him with garlands, and lights, and dances, and tumbrels, and flutes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.3.11'>And though they did these things, they could not for all that mitigate the fierceness of his heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.3.12'>For he both destroyed their cities and cut down their groves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.3.13'>For Nabuchodonosor the king had commanded him to destroy all the gods of the earth, that he only might be called God by those nations which could be brought under him by the power of Holofernes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.3.14'>And when he had passed through all Syria Sobal, and all Apamea, and all Mesopotamia, he came to the Idumeans into the land of Gabaa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.3.15'>And he took possession of their cities, and stayed there for thirty days, in which days he commanded all the troops of his army to be united.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Bar.4'>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.1'>Then the children of Israel, who dwelt in the land of Juda, hearing these things, were exceedingly afraid of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.2'>Dread and horror seized upon their minds, lest he should do the same to Jerusalem and to the temple of the Lord, that he had done to other cities and their temples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.3'>And they sent into all Samaria round about, as far as Jericho, and seized upon all the tops of the mountains:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.4'>And they compassed their towns with walls, and gathered together corn for provision for war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.5'>And Eliachim the priest wrote to all that were over against Esdrelon, which faceth the great plain near Dothain, and to all by whom there might be a passage of way, that they should take possession of the ascents of the mountains, by which there might be any way to Jerusalem, and should keep watch where the way was narrow between the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.6'>And the children of Israel did as the priest of the Lord Eliachim had appointed them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.7'>And all the people cried to the Lord with great earnestness, and they humbled their souls in fastings, and prayers, both they and their wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.8'>And the priests put on haircloths, and they caused the little children to lie prostrate before the temple of the Lord, and the altar of the Lord they covered with haircloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.9'>And they cried to the Lord the God of Israel with one accord, that their children might not be made a prey, and their wives carried off, and their cities destroyed, and their holy things profaned, and that they might not be made a reproach to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.10'>Then Eliachim the high priest of the Lord went about all Israel and spoke to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.11'>Saying: Know ye that the Lord will hear your prayers, if you continue with perseverance in fastings and prayers in the sight of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.12'>Remember Moses the servant of the Lord, who overcame Amalec that trusted in his own strength, and in his power, and in his army, and in his shields, and in his chariots, and in his horsemen, not by fighting with the sword, but by holy prayers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.13'>So shall all the enemies of Israel be, if you persevere in this work which you have begun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.14'>So they being moved by this exhortation of his, prayed to the Lord, and continued in the sight of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.15'>So that even they who offered the holocausts to the Lord, offered the sacrifices to the Lord girded with haircloths, and with ashes upon their head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.16'>And they all begged of God with all their heart, that he would visit his people Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Bar.5'>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.1'>And it was told Holofernes the general of the army of the Assyrians, that the children of Israel prepared themselves to resist, and had shut up the ways of the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.2'>And he was transported with exceeding great fury and indignation, and he called all the princes of Moab and the leaders of Amman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.3'>And he said to them: Tell me what is this people that besetteth the mountains: or what are their cities, and of what sort, and how great: also what is their power, or what is their multitude: or who is the king over their warfare:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.4'>And why they above all that dwell in the east, have despised us, and have not come out to meet us, that they might receive us with peace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.5'>Then Achior captain of all the children of Ammon answering, said: If thou vouch safe, my lord, to hear, I will tell the truth in thy sight concerning this people, that dwelleth in the mountains, and there shall not a false word come out of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.6'>This people is of the offspring of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.7'>They dwelt first in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow the gods of their fathers, who were in the land of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.8'>Wherefore forsaking the ceremonies of their fathers, which consisted in the worship of many gods,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.9'>They worshipped one God of heaven, who also commanded them to depart from thence, and to dwell in Charan. And when there was a famine over all the land, they went down into Egypt, and there for four hundred years were so multiplied, that the army of them could not be numbered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.10'>And when the king of Egypt oppressed them, and made slaves of them to labour in clay and brick, in the building of his cities, they cried to their Lord, and he struck the whole land of Egypt with divers plagues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.11'>And when the Egyptians had cast them out from them, and the plague had ceased from them, and they had a mind to take them again, and bring them back to their service,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.12'>The God of heaven opened the sea to them in their flight, so that the waters were made to stand firm as a wall on either side, and they walked through the bottom of the sea and passed it dry foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.13'>And when an innumerable army of the Egyptians pursued after them in that place, they were so overwhelmed with the waters, that there was not one left, to tell what had happened to posterity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.14'>And after they came out of the Red Sea, they abode in the deserts of mount Sina, in which never man could dwell, or son of man rested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.15'>There bitter fountains were made sweet for them to drink, and for forty years they received food from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.16'>Wheresoever they went in without bow and arrow, and without shield and sword, their God fought for them and overcame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.17'>And there was no one that triumphed over this people, but when they departed from the worship of the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.18'>But as often as beside their own God, they worshipped any other, they were given to spoil, and to the sword, and to reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.19'>And as often as they were penitent for having revolted from the worship of their God, the God of heaven gave them power to resist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.20'>So they overthrew the king of the Chanaanites, and of the Jebusites, and of the Pherezites, and of the Hethites, and of the Hevites, and of the Amorrhites, and all the mighty ones in Hesebon, and they possessed their lands, and their cities:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.21'>And as long as they sinned not in the sight of their God, it was well with them: for their God hateth iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.22'>And even some years ago when they had revolted from the way which God had given them to walk therein, they were destroyed in battles by many nations, and very many of them were led away captive into a strange land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.23'>But of late returning to the Lord their God, from the different places wherein they were scattered, they are come together and are gone up into all these mountains, and possess Jerusalem again, where their holies are</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.24'>Now therefore, my lord, search if there be any iniquity of theirs in the sight of their God: let us go up to them, because their God will surely deliver them to thee, and they shall be brought under the yoke of thy power:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.25'>But if there be no offense of this people in the sight of their God, we can not resist them, because their God will defend them: and we shall be a reproach to the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.26'>And it came to pass, when Achior had ceased to speak these words, all the great men of Holofernes were angry, and they had a mind to kill him, saying to each other:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.27'>Who is this, that saith the children of Israel can resist king Nabuchodonosor, and his armies, men unarmed, and without force, and without skill in the art of war?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.28'>That Achior therefore may know that he deceiveth us, let us go up into the mountains: and when the bravest of them shall be taken, then shall he with them be stabbed with the sword:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.29'>That every nation may know that Nabuchodonosor is god of the earth, and besides him there is no other.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Bar.6'>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.1'>And it came to pass when they had left off speaking, that Holofernes being in a violent passion, said to Achior:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.2'>Because thou hast prophesied unto us, saying: That the nation of Israel is defended by their God, to shew thee that there is no God, but Nabuehodonosor:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.3'>When we shall slay them all as one man, then thou also shalt die with them by the sword of the Assyrians, and all Israel shall perish with thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.4'>And thou shalt find that Nabuchodonosor is lord of the whole earth: and then the sword of my soldiers shall pass through thy sides, and thou shalt be stabbed and fall among the wounded of Israel, and thou shalt breathe no more till thou be destroyed with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.5'>But if thou think thy prophecy true, let not thy countenance sink, and let the paleness that is in thy face, depart from thee, if thou imaginest these my words cannot be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.6'>And that thou mayst know that thou shalt experience these things together with them, behold from this hour thou shalt be associated to their people, that when they shall receive the punishment they deserve from my sword, thou mayst fall under the same vengeance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.7'>Then Holofernes commanded his servants to take Achior, and to lead him to Bethulia, and to deliver him into the hands of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.8'>And the servants of Holofernes taking him, went through the plains: but when they came near the mountains, the slingers came out against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.9'>Then turning out of the way by the side of the mountain, they tied Achior to a tree hand and foot, and so left him bound with ropes, and returned to their master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.10'>And the children of Israel coming down from Bethulia, came to him, and loosing him they brought him to Bethulia, and setting him in the midst of the people, asked him what was the matter, that the Assyrians had left him bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.11'>In those days the rulers there, were Ozias the son of Micha of the tribe of Simeon, and Charmi, called also Gothoniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.12'>And Achior related in the midst of the ancients, and in the presence of all the people, all that he had said being asked by Holofernes: and how the people of Holofernes would have killed him for this word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.13'>And how Holofernes himself being angry had commanded him to be delivered for this cause to the Israelites: that when he should overcome the children of Israel, then he might command Achior also himself to be put to death by diverse torments, for having said: The God of heaven is their defender.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.14'>And when Achior had declared all these things, all the people fell upon their faces, adoring the Lord, and all of them together mourning and weeping poured out their prayers with one accord to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.15'>Saying: O Lord God of heaven and earth, behold their pride, and look on our low condition, and have regard to the face of thy saints, and shew that thou forsakes not them that trust on thee, and that thou humblest them that presume of themselves, and glory in their own strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.16'>So when their weeping was ended, and the peoples prayer, in which they continued all the day, was concluded, they comforted Achior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.17'>Saying: the God of our fathers, whose power thou hast set forth, will make this return to thee, that thou rather shalt see their destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.18'>And when the Lord our God shall give this liberty to his servants, let God be with thee also in the midst of us: that as it shall please thee, so thou with all thine mayst converse with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.19'>Then Ozias, after the assembly was broken up, received him into his house, and made him a great supper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.20'>And all the ancients were invited, and they refreshed themselves together after their fast was over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.21'>And afterwards all the people were called together, and they prayed all the night long within the church, desiring help of the God of Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Bar.7'>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.1'>But Holofernes on the next day gave orders to his army, to go up against Bethulia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.2'>Now there were in his troops a hundred and twenty thousand footmen, and two and twenty thousand horsemen, besides the preparations of those men who had been taken, and who had been brought away out of the provinces and cities of all the youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.3'>All these prepared themselves together to fight against the children of Israel, and they came by the hillside to the top, which looketh toward Dothain, from the place which is called Behlma, unto Chelmon, which is over against Esdrelon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.4'>But the children of Israel, when they saw the multitude of them, prostrated themselves upon the ground, putting ashes upon their heads, praying with one accord, that the God of Israel would shew his mercy upon his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.5'>And taking their arms of war, they posted themselves at the places, which by a narrow pathway lead directly between the mountains, and they guarded them all day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.6'>Now Holofernes, in going round about, found that the fountains which supplied them with water, ran through an aqueduct without the city on the south side: and he commanded their aqueduct to he cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.7'>Nevertheless there were springs not far from the walls, out of which they were seen secretly to draw water, to refresh themselves a little rather than to drink their fill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.8'>But the children of Ammon and Moab came to Holofernes, saying: The children of Israel trust not in their spears, nor in their arrows, but the mountains are their defense, and the steep hires and precipices guard them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.9'>Wherefore that thou mayst overcome them without joining battle, set guards at the springs that they may not draw water out of them, and thou shalt destroy them without sword, or at least being wearied out they will yield up their city, which they suppose, because it is situate in the mountains, to be impregnable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.10'>And these words pleased Holofernes, and his officers, and he placed all round about a hundred men at every spring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.11'>And when they had kept this watch for full twenty days, the cisterns, and the reserve of waters failed among all the inhabitants of Bethulia, so that there was not within the city, enough to satisfy them, no not for one day, for water was daily given out to the people by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.12'>Then all the men and women, young men, and children, gathering themselves together to Ozias, all together with one voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.13'>Said: God be judge between us and thee, for thou hast done evil against us, in that thou wouldst not speak peaceably with the Assyrians, and for this cause God hath sold us into their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.14'>And therefore there is no one to help us, while we are cast down before their eyes in thirst, and sad destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.15'>And now assemble ye all that are in the city, that we may of our own accord yield ourselves all up to the people of Holofernes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.16'>For it is better, that being captives we should live and bless the Lord, than that we should die, and be a reproach to all flesh, after we have seen our wives and our infants die before our eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.17'>We call to witness this day heaven and earth, and the God of our fathers, who taketh vengeance upon us according to our sins, conjuring you to deliver now the city into the hand of the army of Holofernes, that our end may be short by the edge of the sword, which is made longer by the drought of thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.18'>And when they had said these things, there was great weeping and lamentation of all in the assembly, and for many hours with one voice they cried to God, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.19'>We have sinned with our fathers we have done unjustly, we have commited iniquity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.20'>Have thou mercy on us, because thou art good, or punish our iniquities by chastising us thyself, and deliver not them that trust in thee to a people that knoweth not thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.21'>That they may not say among the gentiles: Where is their God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.22'>And when being wearied with these cries, and tired with these weepings, they held their peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.23'>Ozias rising up all in tears, said: Be of good courage, my brethren, and let us wait these five days for mercy from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.24'>For perhaps he will put a stop to his indignation, and will give glory to his own name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.7.25'>But if after five days be past there come no aid, we will do the things which you leave spoken.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Bar.8.1'>Now it came to pass, when Judith a widow had heard these words, who was the daughter of Merari, the son of Idox, the son of Joseph, the son of Ozias, the son of Elai, the son of Jamnor, the son of Gedeon, the son of Raphaim, the son of Achitob, the son of Melehias, the son of Enan, the son of Nathanias, the son of Salathiel, the son of Simeon, the son of Ruben:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.2'>And her husband was Manasses, who died in the time of the barley harvest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.3'>For he was standing over them that bound sheaves in the field ; and the heat came upon his head, and he died in Bethulia his own city, and was buried there with his fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.4'>And Judith his relict was a widow now three years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.5'>And she made herself a private chamber in the upper part of her house, in which she abode shut up with her maids.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.6'>And she wore haircloth upon her loins, and fasted all the days of her life, except the sabbaths, and new moons, and the feasts of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.7'>And she was exceedingly beautiful, and her husband left her great riches, and very many servants, and large possessions of herds of oxen, and flocks of sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.8'>And she was greatly renowned among all, because she feared the Lord very much, neither was there any one that spoke an ill word of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.9'>When therefore she had heard that Ozias had promised that he would deliver up the city after the fifth day, she sent to the ancients Chabri and Charmi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.10'>And they came to her, and she said to them: What is this word, by which Ozias hath consented to give up the city to the Assyrians, if within five days there come no aid to us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.11'>And who are you that tempt the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.12'>This is not a word that may draw down mercy, but rather that may stir up wrath, and enkindle indignation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.13'>You have set a time for the mercy of the Lord, and you have appointed him a day, according to your pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.14'>But forasmuch as the Lord is patient, let us be penitent for this same thing, and with many tears let us beg his pardon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.15'>For God will not threaten like man, nor be inflamed to anger like the son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.16'>And therefore let us humble our souls before him, and continuing in an humble spirit, in his service:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.17'>Let us ask the Lord with tears, that according to his will so he would shew his mercy to us: that as our heart is troubled by their pride, so also we may glorify in our humility.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Bar.8.19'>For which crime they were given up to their enemies, to the sword, and to pillage, and to confusion: but we know no other God but him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.20'>Let us humbly wait for his consolation, and the Lord our God will require our blood of the afflictions of our enemies, and he will humble all the nations that shall rise up against us, and bring them to disgrace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.21'>And now, brethren, as you are the ancients among the people of God, and their very soul resteth upon you: comfort their hearts by your speech, that they may be mindful how our fathers were tempted that they might be proved, whether they worshipped their God truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.22'>They must remember how our father Abraham was tempted, and being proved by many tribulations, was made the friend of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.23'>go Isaac, so Jacob, so Moses, and all that have pleased God, passed through many tribulations, remaining faithful.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Bar.8.29'>Now therefore pray for us, for thou art a holy woman, and one fearing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.8.30'>And Judith said to them: As you know that what I have been able to say is of God:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Bar.9.1'>And when they were gone, Judith went into her oratory: and putting on haircloth, laid ashes on her head: and falling down prostrate before the Lord, she cried to the Lord, saying:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Bar.9.8'>The deep held their feet, and the waters overwhelmed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.9.9'>So may it be with these also, O Lord, who trust in their multitude, and in their chariots, and in their pikes, and in their shields, and in their arrows, and glory in their spears,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Bar.13.13'>And Judith from afar off cried to the watchmen upon the walls: Open the gates for God is with us, who hath shewn his power in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.14'>And it came to pass, when the men had heard her voice, that they called the ancients of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.15'>And all ran to meet her from the least to the greatest: for they now had no hopes that she would come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.16'>And lighting up lights they all gathered round about her: and she went up to a higher place, and commanded silence to be made. And when all had held their peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.17'>Judith said: Praise ye the Lord our God, who hath not forsaken them that hope in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.18'>And by me his handmaid he hath fulfilled his mercy, which he promised to the house of Israel: and he hath killed the enemy of his people by my hand this night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.19'>Then she brought forth the head of Holofernes out of the wallet, and shewed it them, saying: Behold the head of Holofernes the general of the army of the Assyrians, and behold his canopy, wherein he lay in his drunkenness, where the Lord our God slew him by the hand of a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.20'>But as the same Lord liveth, his angel hath been my keeper both going hence, and abiding there, and returning from thence hither: and the Lord hath not suffered me his handmaid to be defiled, but hath brought me back to you without pollution of sin, rejoicing for his victory, for my escape, and for your deliverance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.21'>Give all of you glory to him, because he is good, because his mercy endureth for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.22'>And they all adored the Lord, and said to her: The Lord hath blessed thee by his power, because by thee he hath brought our enemies to nought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.23'>And Ozias the prince of the people of Israel, said to her: Blessed art thou, O daughter, by the Lord the most high God, above all women upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.24'>Blessed be the Lord who made heaven and earth, who hath directed thee to the cutting off the head of the prince of our enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.25'>Because he hath so magnified thy name this day, that thy praise shall not depart out of the mouth of men who shall be mindful of the power of the Lord for ever, for that thou hast not spared thy life, by reason of the distress and tribulation of thy people, but hast prevented our ruin in the presence of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.26'>And all the people said: So be it, so be it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.27'>And Achior being called for came, and Judith said to him: The God of Israel, to whom thou gavest testimony, that he revengeth himself of his enemies, he hath cut off the head of all the unbelievers this night by my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.28'>And that thou mayst find that it is so, behold the head of Holofernes, who in the contempt of his pride despised the God of Israel: and threatened thee with death, saying: When the people of Israel shall be taken, I will command thy sides to be pierced with a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.29'>Then Achior seeing the head of Holofernes, being seized with a great fear he fell on his face upon the earth, and his soul swooned away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.30'>But after he had recovered his spirits he fell down at her feet, and reverenced her and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.13.31'>Blessed art thou by thy God in every tabernacle of Jacob, for in every nation which shall hear thy name, the God of Israel shall be magnified on occasion of thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Bar.14'>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.1'>And Judith said to all the people: Hear me, my brethren, hang ye up this head upon our walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.2'>And as soon as the sun shall rise, let every man take his arms, and rush ye out, not as going down beneath, but as making an assault.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.3'>Then the watchmen must needs run to awake their prince for the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.4'>And when the captains of them shall run to the tent of Holofernes, and shall find him without his head wallowing in his blood, fear shall fall upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.5'>And when you shall know that they are fleeing, go after them securely, for the Lord will destroy them under your feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.6'>Then Achior seeing the power that the God of Israel had wrought, leaving the religion of the gentiles, he believed God, and circumcised the flesh of his foreskin, and was joined to the people of Israel, with all the succession of his kindred until this present day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.7'>And immediately at break of day, they hung up the head of Holofernes upon the walls, and every man took his arms, and they sent out with a great noise and shouting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.8'>And the watchmen seeing this, ran to the tent of Holofernes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.9'>And they that were in the tent came, and made a noise before the door of the chamber to awake him, endeavoring by art to break his rest, that Holofernes might awake, not by their calling him, but by their noise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.10'>For no man durst knock, or open and go into the chamber of the general of the Assyrians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.11'>But when his captains and tribunes were come, and all the chiefs of the army of the king of the Assyrians, they said to the chamberlains</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.12'>Go in, and awake him, for the mice coming out of their holes, have presumed to challenge us to fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.13'>Then Vagao going into his chamber, stood before the curtain, and made a clapping with his hands: for he thought that he was sleeping with Judith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.14'>But when with hearkening, he perceived no motion of one lying, he came near to the curtain, and lifting it up, and seeing the body of Holofernes, lying upon the ground, without the head, sweltering in his blood, he cried out with a loud voice, with weeping, and rent his garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.15'>And he went into the tent of Judith, and not finding her, he ran out to the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.16'>And said: One Hebrew woman hath made confusion in the house of king Nabuchodonosor: for behold Holofernes lieth upon the ground, and his head is not upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.17'>Now when the chiefs of the army of the Assyrians had heard this, they all rent their garments, and an intolerable fear and dread fell upon them, and their minds were troubled exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.14.18'>And there was a very great cry in the midst of their camp.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Bar.15'>
        <verse osisID='Bar.15.1'>And when all the army heard that Holofernes was beheaded, courage and counsel fled from them, and being seized with trembling and fear they thought only to save themselves by flight:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.15.2'>So that no one spoke to his neighbor, but hanging down the head, leaving all things behind, they made haste to escape from the Hebrews, who, as they heard, were coming armed upon them, and fled by the ways of the fields, and the paths of the hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.15.3'>So the children of Israel seeing them fleeing, followed after them. And they went down sounding with trumpets and shouting after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.15.4'>And because the Assyrians were not united together, they went without order in their flight ; but the children of Israel pursuing in one body, defeated all that they could find.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.15.5'>And Ozias sent messengers through all the cities and countries of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.15.6'>And every country, and every city, sent their chosen young men armed after them, and they pursued them with the edge of the sword until they came to the extremities of their confines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.15.7'>And the rest that were in Bethulia went into the camp of the Assyrians, and took away the spoils, which the Assyrians in their flight had left behind them, and they were laden exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.15.8'>But they that returned conquerors to Bethulia, brought with them all things that were theirs, so that there was no numbering of their cattle, and beasts, and all their moveables, insomuch that from the least to the greatest all were made rich by their spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.15.9'>And Joachim the high priest came from Jerusalem to Bethulia with all his ancients to see Judith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.15.10'>And when she was come out to him, they all blessed her with one voice, saying: Thou art the glory of Jerusalem, thou art the joy of Israel, thou art the honour of our people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.15.11'>For thou hast done manfully, and thy heart has been strengthened, because thou hast loved chastity, and after thy husband hast not known any other: therefore also the hand of the Lord hath strengthened thee, and therefore thou shalt be blessed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.15.12'>And all the people said: So be it, so be it</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.15.13'>And thirty days were scarce sufficient for the people of Israel to gather up the spoils of the Assyrians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.15.14'>But all those things that were proved to be the peculiar goods of Holofernes, they gave to Judith in gold, and silver, and garments and precious stones, and all household stuff, and they all were delivered to her by the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.15.15'>And all the people rejoiced, with the women, and virgins, and young men, playing on instruments and harps.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Bar.16'>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.1'>Then Judith sung this canticle to the Lord, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.2'>Begin ye to the Lord with timbrels, sing ye to the Lord with cymbals, tune unto him a new psalm, extol and call upon his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.3'>The Lord putteth an end to wars, the Lord is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.4'>He hath set his camp in the midst of his people, to deliver us from the hand of all our enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.5'>The Assyrians came out of the mountains from the north in the multitude of his strength: his multitude stopped up the torrents, and their horses covered the valleys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.6'>He bragged that he would set my borders on fire, and kill my young men with the sword, to make my infants a prey, and my virgins captives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.7'>But the almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the hands of a woman, and hath slain him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.8'>For their mighty one did not fall by young men, neither did the sons of Titan strike him, nor tall giants oppose themselves to him, but Judith the daughter of Merari weakened him with the beauty of her face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.9'>For she put off her the garments of widowhood, and put on her the garments of joy, to give joy to the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.10'>She anointed her face with ointment, and bound up her locks with a crown, she took a new robe to deceive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.11'>Her sandals ravished his eyes, her beauty made his soul her captive, with a sword she cut off his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.12'>The Persians quaked at her constancy, and the Medes at her boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.13'>Then the camp of the Assyrians howled, when my lowly ones appeared, parched with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.14'>The sons of the damsels have pierced them through, and they have killed them like children fleeing away: they perished in battle before the face of the Lord my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.15'>Let us sing a hymn to the Lord, let us sing a new hymn to our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.16'>O Adonai, Lord, great art thou, and glorious in thy power, and no one can overcome thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.17'>Let all thy creatures serve thee: because thou hast spoken, and they were made: thou didst send forth thy spirit, and they were created, and there is no one that can resist thy voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.18'>The mountains shall be moved from the foundations with the waters: the rooks shall melt as wax before thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.19'>But they that fear thee, shall be great with thee in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.20'>Woe be to the nation that riseth up against my people: for the Lord almighty will take revenge on them, in the day of judgment he will visit them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.21'>For he will give fire, and worms into their flesh, that they may burn, and may feel for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.22'>And it came to pass after these things, that all the people, after the victory, came to Jerusalem to adore the Lord: and as soon as they were purified, they all offered holocausts, and vows, and their promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.23'>And Judith offered for an anathema of oblivion all the arms of Holofernes, which the people gave her, and the canopy that she had taken away out of his chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.24'>And the people were joyful in the sight of the sanctuary, and for three months the joy of this victory was celebrated with Judith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.25'>And after those days every man returned to his house, and Judith was made great in Bethulia, and she was most renowned in all the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.26'>And chastity was joined to her virtue, so that she knew no man all the days of her life, after the death of Manasses her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.27'>And on festival days she came forth with great glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.28'>And she abode in her husband's house a hundred and five years, and made her handmaid free, and she died, and was buried with her husband in Bethulia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.29'>And all the people mourned for seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.30'>And all the time of her life there was none that troubled Israel, nor many years after her death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.16.31'>But the day of the festivity of this victory is received by the Hebrews in the number of holy days, and is religiously observed by the Jews from that time until this day.</verse>
