  <div type='book' osisID='Mark'>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it is written in Isaias the prophet: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare the way before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>A voice of one crying in the desert: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John was in the desert baptizing, and preaching the baptism of penance, unto remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And there went out to him all the country of Judea, and all they of Jerusalem, and were baptized by him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>And John was clothed with camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And he preached, saying: There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I have baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it came to pass, in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And forthwith coming up out of he water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit as a dove descending, and remaining on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And there came a voice from heaven: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was in the desert forty days and forty nights, and was tempted by Satan; and he was with beasts, and the angels ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>And after that John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>And saying: The time is accomplished, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and believe the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And passing by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting nets into the sea (for they were fishermen).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And Jesus said to them: Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And immediately leaving their nets, they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And going on from thence a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were mending their nets in the ship:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And forthwith he called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired men, they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they entered into Capharnaum, and forthwith upon the sabbath days going into the synagogue, he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were astonished at his doctrine. For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>Saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Jesus threatened him, saying: Speak no more, and go out of the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And the unclean spirit tearing him, and crying out with a loud voice, went out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying: What thing is this? what is this new doctrine? for with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>And Simon's wife's mother lay in a fit of a fever: and forthwith they tell him of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And coming to her, he lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>And when it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all that were ill and that were possessed with devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases; and he cast out many devils, and he suffered them not to speak, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place: and there he prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon, and they that were with him, followed after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>And when they had found him, they said to him: All seek for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And he saith to them: Let us go into the neighbouring towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he was preaching in their synagogues, and in all Galilee, and casting out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down said to him: If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And Jesus having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand; and touching him, saith to him: I will. Be thou made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>And he saith to him: See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the high priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word: so that he could not openly go into the city, but was without in desert places: and they flocked to him from all sides.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And again he entered into Capharnaum after some days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And it was heard that he was in the house, and many came together, so that there was no room; no, not even at the door; and he spoke to them the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they came to him, bringing one sick of the palsy, who was carried by four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And when they could not offer him unto him for the multitude, they uncovered the roof where he was; and opening it, they let down the bed wherein the man sick of the palsy lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>And when Jesus had seen their faith, he saith to the sick of the palsy: Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>And there were some of the scribes sitting there, and thinking in their hearts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Why doth this man speak thus? he blasphemeth. Who can forgive sins, but God only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>Which Jesus presently knowing in his spirit, that they so thought within themselves, saith to them: Why think you these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy: Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say: Arise, take up thy bed, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>I say to thee: Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And immediately he arose; and taking up his bed, went his way in the sight of all; so that all wondered and glorified God, saying: We never saw the like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>And he went forth again to the sea side; and all the multitude came to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And when he was passing by, he saw Levi the son of Alpheus sitting at the receipt of custom; and he saith to him: Follow me. And rising up, he followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And it came to pass, that as he sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat down together with Jesus and his disciples. For they were many, who also followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing that he ate with publicans and sinners, said to his disiples: Why doth your master eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>Jesus hearing this, saith to them: They that are well have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. For I came not to call the just, but sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>And the disiples of John and the Pharisees used to fast; and they come and say to him: Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast; but thy disciples do not fast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus saith to them: Can the children of the marriage fast, as long as the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them; and then they shall fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No man seweth a piece of raw cloth to an old garment: otherwise the new piecing taketh away from the old, and there is made a greater rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: otherwise the wine will burst the bottles, and both the wine will be spilled, and the bottles will be lost. But new wine must be put into new bottles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>And it came to pass again, as the Lord walked through the corn fields on the sabbath, that his disciples began to go forward, and to pluck the ears of corn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees said to him: Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And he said to them: Have you never read what David did when he had need, and was hungry himself, and they that were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>How he went into the house of God, under Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the loaves of proposition, which was not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave to them who were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said to them: The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>Therefore the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And he entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had a withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath days; that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he said to the man who had the withered hand: Stand up in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>And he saith to them: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy? But they held their peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he saith to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>And the Pharisees going out, immediately made a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>But Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan. And they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing the things which he did, came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had evils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him: and they cried, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>Thou art the Son of God. And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And going up into a mountain, he called unto him whom he would himself: and they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And he made that twelve should be with him, and that he might send them to preach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>And he gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And to Simon he gave the name Peter:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he named them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>And Andrew and Philip, and Bartholomew and Matthew, and Thomas and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Cananean:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And they come to a house, and the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And when his friends had heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him. For they said: He is become mad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scribes who were come down from Jerusalem, said: He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And after he had called them together, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>And if Satan be risen up against himself, he is divided, and cannot stand, but hath an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>No man can enter into the house of a strong man and rob him of his goods, unless he first bind the strong man, and then shall he plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Amen I say to you, that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, shall never have forgiveness, but shall be guilty of an everlasting sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>Because they said: He hath an unclean spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>And his mother and his bretheren came; and standing without, sent unto him, calling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And the multitude sat about him; and they say to him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And answering them, he said: Who is my mother and my brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And looking round about on them who sat about him, he saith: Behold my mother and my brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>For whosoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And again he began to teach by the sea side; and a great multitude was gathered together unto him, so that he went up into a ship, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude was upon the land by the sea side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his doctrine:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>Hear ye: Behold, the sower went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And whilst he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the birds of the air came and ate it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And other some fell upon stony ground, where it had not much earth; and it shot up immediately, because it had no depth of earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>And when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>And some fell upon good ground; and brought forth fruit that grew up, and increased and yielded, one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he was alone, the twelve that were with him asked him the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And he said to them: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all things are done in parables:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand: lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he saith to them: Are you ignorant of this parable? and how shall you know all parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>He that soweth, soweth the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown, and as soon as they have heard, immediately Satan cometh and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these likewise are they that are sown on the stony ground: who when they have heard the word, immediately recieve it with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>And they have no root in themselves, but are only for a time: and then when tribulation and persecution ariseth for the word they are presently scandalized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And others there are who are sown among thorns: these are they that hear the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>And the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts after other things entering in choke the word, and it is made fruitless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And these are they who are sown upon the good ground, who hear the word, and receive it, and yield fruit, the one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he said to them: Doth a candle come in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be made manifest: neither was it made secret, but that it may come abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And he said to them: Take heed what you hear. In what measure you shall mete, it shall be measured to you again, and more shall be given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, that also which he hath shall be taken away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he said: So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>And should sleep, and rise, night and day, and the seed should spring, and grow up whilst he knoweth not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>For the earth of itself bringeth forth fruit, first the blade, then the ear, afterwards the full corn in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>And when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And he said: To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or to what parable shall we compare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is as a grain of mustard seed: which when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>And when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches, so that the birds of the air may dwell under the shadow thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>And with many such parables, he spoke to them the word, according as they were able to hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>And without parable he did not speak unto them; but apart, he explained all things to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>And he saith to them that day, when evening was come: Let us pass over to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>And sending away the multitude, they take him even as he was in the ship: and there were other ships with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that the ship was filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, sleeping upon a pillow; and they awake him, and say to him: Master, doth it not concern thee that we perish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And rising up, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: Peace, be still. And the wind ceased: and there was made a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>And he said to them: Why are you fearful? have you not faith yet? And they feared exceedingly: and they said one to another: Who is this (thinkest thou) that both wind and sea obey him?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>And they came over the strait of the sea into the country of the Gerasens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And as he went out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the monuments a man with an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>Who had his dwelling in the tombs, and no man now could bind him, not even with chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>For having been often bound with fetters and chains, he had burst the chains, and broken the fetters in pieces, and no one could tame him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And he was always day and night in the monuments and in the mountains, crying and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>And seeing Jesus afar off, he ran and adored him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>And crying with a loud voice, he said: What have I to do with thee, Jesus the Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God that thou torment me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For he said unto him: Go out of the man, thou unclean spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And he asked him: What is thy name? And he saith to him: My name is Legion, for we are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he besought him much, that he would not drive him away out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>And there was there near the mountain a great herd of swine, feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>And the spirits besought him, saying: Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>And Jesus immediately gave them leave. And the unclean spirits going out, entered into the swine: and the herd with great violence was carried headlong into the sea, being about two thousand, and were stifled in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the fields. And they went out to see what was done:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>And they came to Jesus, and they see him that was troubled with the devil, sitting, clothed, and well in his wits, and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And they that had seen it, told them, in what manner he had been dealt with who had the devil; and concerning the swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>And they began to pray him that he would depart from their coasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And when he went up into the ship, he that had been troubled with the devil, began to beseech him that he might be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>And he admitted him not, but saith to him: Go into thy house to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had mercy on thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>And when Jesus had passed again in the ship over the strait, a great multitude assembled together unto him, and he was nigh unto the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue named Jairus: and seeing him, falleth down at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>And he besought him much, saying: My daughter is at the point of death, come, lay thy hand upon her, that she may be safe, and may live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And he went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>And a woman who was under an issue of blood twelve years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>And had suffered many things from many physicians; and had spent all that she had, and was nothing the better, but rather worse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>When she had heard of Jesus, came in the crowd behind him, and touched his garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>For she said: If I shall touch but his garment, I shall be whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>And forthwith the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>And immediately Jesus knowing in himself the virtue that had proceeded from him, turning to the multitude, said: Who hath touched my garments?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>And his disciples said to him: Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou who hath touched me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And he looked about to see her who had done this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>And he said to her: Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole: go in peace, and be thou whole of thy disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he was yet speaking, some come from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying: Thy daughter is dead: why dost thou trouble the master any further?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But Jesus having heard the word that was spoken, saith to the ruler of the synagogue: Fear not, only believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And he admitted not any man to follow him, but Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he seeth a tumult, and people weeping and wailing much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And going in, he saith to them: Why make you this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they laughed him to scorn. But he having put them all out, taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>And taking the damsel by the hand, he saith to her: Talitha cumi, which is, being interpreted: Damsel (I say to thee) arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>And immediately the damsel rose up, and walked: and she was twelve years old: and they were astonished with a great astonishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>And he charged them strictly that no man should know it: and commanded that something should be given her to eat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>And going out from thence, he went into his own country; and his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were in admiration at his doctrine, saying: How came this man by all these things? and what wisdom is this that is given to him, and such mighty works as are wrought by his hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joseph, and Jude, and Simon? are not also his sisters here with us? And they were scandalized in regard of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>And Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honor, but in his own country, and in his own house, and among his own kindred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>And he could not do any miracles there, only that he cured a few that were sick, laying his hands upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And he wondered because of their unbelief, and he went through the villages round about teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And he called the twelve; and began to send them two and two, and gave them power over unclean spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>And he commanded them that they should take nothing for the way, but a staff only: no scrip, no bread, nor money in their purse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>But to be shod with sandals, and that they should not put on two coats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>And he said to them: Wheresoever you shall enter into an house, there abide till you depart from that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you; going forth from thence, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>And going forth they preached that men should do penance:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>And king Herod heard, (for his name was made manifest,) and he said: John the Baptist is risen again from the dead, and therefore mighty works shew forth themselves in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>And others said: It is Elias. But others said: It is a prophet, as one of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>Which Herod hearing, said: John whom I beheaded, he is risen again from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herod himself had sent and apprehended John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>For John said to Herod: It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>Now Herodias laid snares for him: and was desirous to put him to death, and could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>For Herod feared John, knowing him to be a just and holy man: and kept him, and when he heard him, did many things: and he heard him willingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>And when a convenient day was come, Herod made a supper for his birthday, for the princes, and tribunes, and chief men of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>And when the daughter of the same Herodias had come in, and had danced, and pleased Herod, and them that were at table with him, the king said to the damsel: Ask of me what thou wilt, and I will give it thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>And he swore to her: Whatsoever thou shalt ask I will give thee, though it be the half of my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>Who when she was gone out, said to her mother, What shall I ask? But she said: The head of John the Baptist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>And when she was come in immediately with haste to the king, she asked, saying: I will that forthwith thou give me in a dish, the head of John the Baptist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>And the king was struck sad. Yet because of his oath, and because of them that were with him at table, he would not displease her:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>But sending an executioner, he commanded that his head should be brought in a dish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>And he beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head in a dish: and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>Which his disciples hearing came, and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>And the apostles coming together unto Jesus, related to him all things that they had done and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>And he said to them: Come apart into a desert place, and rest a little. For there were many coming and going: and they had not so much as time to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>And going up into a ship, they went into a desert place apart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>And they saw them going away, and many knew: and they ran flocking thither on foot from all the cities, and were there before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>And Jesus going out saw a great multitude: and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, saying: This is a desert place, and the hour is now past:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>Send them away, that going into the next villages and towns, they may buy themselves meat to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>And he answering said to them: Give you them to eat. And they said to him: Let us go and buy bread for two hundred pence, and we will give them to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>And he saith to them: How many loaves have you? go and see. And when they knew, they say: Five, and two fishes</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>And he commanded them that they should make them all sit down by companies upon the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>And when he had taken the five loaves, and the two fishes: looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave to his disciples to set before them: and the two fishes he divided among them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>And they all did eat, and had their fill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>And they took up the leavings, twelve full baskets of fragments, and of the fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>And they that did eat, were five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>And immediately he obliged his disciples to go up into the ship, that they might go before him over the water to Bethsaida, whilst he dismissed the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>And when he had dismissed them, he went up to the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>And when it was late, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and himself alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>And seeing them labouring in rowing, (for the wind was against them,) and about the fourth watch of the night, he cometh to them walking upon the sea, and he would have passed by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>But they seeing him walking upon the sea, thought it was an apparition, and they cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he spoke with them, and said to them: Have a good heart, it is I, fear ye not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>And he went up to them into the ship, and the wind ceased: and they were far more astonished within themselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>For they understood not concerning the loaves; for their heart was blinded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Genezareth, and set to the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>And when they were gone out of the ship, immediately they knew him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>And running through that whole country, they began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And whithersoever he entered, into towns or into villages or cities, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>And there assembled together unto him the Pharisees and some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>And when they had seen some of his disciples eat bread with common, that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews eat not without often washing their hands, holding the tradition of the ancients:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>And when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not: and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of pots, and of brazen vessels, and of beds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>And the Pharisees and scribes asked him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>But he answering, said to them: Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>And in vain to they worship me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups: and many other things you do like to these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>And he said to them: Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>For Moses said: Honor thy father and thy mother; and He that shall curse father or mother, dying let him die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>But you say: If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban, (which is a gift,) whatsoever is from me, shall profit thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>Making void the word of God by your own tradition, which you have given forth. And many other such like things you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>And calling again the multitude unto him, he said to them: Hear ye me all, and understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>There is nothing from without a man that entering into him, can defile him. But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.16'>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>And he saith to them: So are you also without knowledge? understand you not that every thing from without, entering into a man cannot defile him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>Because it entereth not into his heart, but goeth into the belly, and goeth out into the privy, purging all meats?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>For from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>All these evil things come from within, and defile a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it, and he could not be hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came in and fell down at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>Who said to her: Suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not good to take the bread of the children, and cast it to the dogs.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>And he said to her: For this saying go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed, and that the devil was gone out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>And they bring to him one deaf and dumb; and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, he touched his tongue:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>And looking up to heaven, he groaned, and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well; he hath made both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>In those days again, when there was a great multitude, and had nothing to eat; calling his disciples together, he saith to them:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>And if I shall send them away fasting to their home, they will faint in the way; for some of them came from afar off.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>And he asked them: How many loaves have ye? Who said: Seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>And taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, he broke, and gave to his disciples for to set before them; and they set them before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>And they had a few little fishes; and he blessed them, and commanded them to be set before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>And they did eat and were filled; and they took up that which was left of the fragments, seven baskets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>And they that had eaten were about four thousand; and he sent them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>And immediately going up into a ship with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, asking him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>And sighing deeply in spirit, he saith: Why doth this generation seek a sign? Amen, I say to you, a sign shall not be given to this generation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>And they forgot to take bread; and they had but one loaf with them in the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>And he charged them, saying: Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>And he began to speak to them in parables: A certain man planted a vineyard and made a hedge about it, and dug a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it to husbandmen; and went into a far country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant to receive of the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>Who having laid hands on him, beat him, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.4'>And again he sent to them another servant; and him they wounded in the head, and used him reproachfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.5'>And again he sent another, and him they killed: and many others, of whom some they beat, and others they killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.6'>Therefore having yet one son, most dear to him; he also sent him unto them last of all, saying: They will reverence my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.7'>But the husbandmen said one to another: This is the heir; come let us kill him; and the inheritance shall be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.8'>And laying hold on him, they killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.9'>What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy those husbandmen; and will give the vineyard to others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.10'>And have you not read this scripture, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.11'>By the Lord has this been done, and it is wonderful in our eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>And they sought to lay hands on him, but they feared the people. For they knew that he spoke this parable to them. And leaving him, they went their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians; that they should catch him in his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>Who coming, say to him: Master, we know that thou art a true speaker, and carest not for any man; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar; or shall we not give it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>Who knowing their wiliness, saith to them: Why tempt you me? bring me a penny that I may see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.16'>And they brought it him. And he saith to them: Whose is this image and inscription? They say to him, Caesar's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.17'>And Jesus answering, said to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>And there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>Master, Moses wrote unto us, that if any man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>Now there were seven brethren; and the first took a wife, and died leaving no issue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.21'>And the second took her, and died: and neither did he leave any issue. And the third in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>And the seven all took her in like manner; and did not leave issue. Last of all the woman also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise again, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>And Jesus answering, saith to them: Do ye not therefore err, because you know not the scriptures, nor the power of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For when they shall rise again from the dead, they shall neither marry, nor be married, but are as the angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>And as concerning the dead that they rise again, have you not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.27'>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You therefore do greatly err.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>And there came one of the scribes that had heard them reasoning together, and seeing that he had answered them well, asked him which was the first commandment of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>And Jesus answered him: The first commandment of all is, Hear, O Israel: the Lord thy God is one God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind, and with thy whole strength. This is the first commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>And the second is like to it: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>And the scribe said to him: Well, Master, thou hast said in truth, that there is one God, and there is no other besides him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>And that he should be loved with the whole heart, and with the whole understanding, and with the whole soul, and with the whole strength; and to love one's neighbour as one's self, is a greater thing than all holocausts and sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>And Jesus seeing that he had answered wisely, said to him: Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>And Jesus answering, said, teaching in the temple: How do the scribes say, that Christ is the son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>For David himself saith by the Holy Ghost: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.37'>David therefore himself calleth him Lord, and whence is he then his son? And a great multitude heard him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>And he said to them in his doctrine: Beware of the scribes, who love to walk in long robes, and to be saluted in the marketplace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.39'>And to sit in the first chairs, in the synagogues, and to have the highest places at suppers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>Who devour the houses of widows under the pretence of long prayer: these shall receive greater judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>And Jesus sitting over against the treasury, beheld how the people cast money into the treasury, and many that were rich cast in much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>And there came a certain poor widow, and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>And calling his disciples together, he saith to them: Amen I say to you, this poor widow hath cast in more than all they who have cast into the treasury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want cast in all she had, even her whole living.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.1'>And as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him: Master, behold what manner of stones and what buildings are here.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.3'>And as he sat on the mount of Olivet over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him apart:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.5'>And Jesus answering, began to say to them, Take heed lest any man deceive you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.7'>And when you shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, fear ye not. For such things must needs be, but the end is not yet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me. And he began to weep.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>And straightway in the morning, the chief priests holding a consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council, binding Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>And Pilate asked him: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, saith to him: Thou sayest it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>And the chief priests accused him in many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? behold in how many things they accuse thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus still answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>And there was one called Barabbas, who was put in prison with some seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would do, as he had ever done unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>And Pilate answered them, and said: Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>And Pilate again answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>But they again cried out: Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace, and they called together the whole band:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>And they struck his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they adored him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own garments on him, and they led him out to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; but he took it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And the inscription of his cause was written over: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith: And with the wicked he was reputed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days buildest it up again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>Save thyself, coming down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>In like manner also the chief priests mocking, said with the scribes one to another: He saved others; himself he cannot save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>And some of the standers by hearing, said: Behold he calleth Elias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar, and putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying: Stay, let us see if Elias come to take him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>And Jesus having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost, said: Indeed this man was the son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>And there were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joseph, and Salome:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>Who also when he was in Galilee followed him, and ministered to him, and many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>And when evening was now come, (because it was the Parasceve, that is, the day before the sabbath,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead. And sending for the centurion, he asked him if he were already dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And when he had understood it by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And Joseph buying fine linen, and taking him down, wrapped him up in the fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>And Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of Joseph, beheld where he was laid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought sweet spices, that coming, they might anoint Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they come to the sepulchre, the sun being now risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they said one to another: Who shall roll us back the stone from the door of the sepulchre?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>And looking, they saw the stone rolled back. For it was very great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed with a white robe: and they were astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>Who saith to them: Be not affrighted; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is risen, he is not here, behold the place where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, as he told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>But they going out, fled from the sepulchre. For a trembling and fear had seized them: and they said nothing to any man; for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>But he rising early the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary Magdalen, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went and told them that had been with him, who were mourning and weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>And they hearing that he was alive, and had been seen by her, did not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>And after that he appeared in another shape to two of them walking, as they were going into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>And they going told it to the rest: neither did they believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table: and he upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And he said to them: Go ye into the whole world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved: but he that believeth not shall be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name they shall cast out devils: they shall speak with new tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>They shall take up serpents; and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them: they shall lay their hands upon the sick, and they shall recover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>But they going forth preached every where: the Lord working withal, and confirming the word with signs that followed.</verse>
