      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>The same was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things were made by him: and without him was made nothing that was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>This man came for a witness, to give testimony of the light, that all men might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not the light, but was to give testimony of the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>That was the true light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But as many as received him, he gave them power to be made the sons of God, to them that believe in his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>Who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we saw his glory, the glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John beareth witness of him, and crieth out, saying: This was he of whom I spoke: He that shall come after me, is preferred before me: because he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>And of his fulness we all have received, and grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law was given by Moses; grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No man hath seen God at any time: the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites to him, to ask him: Who art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he confessed, and did not deny: and he confessed: I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him: What then? Art thou Elias? And he said: I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered: No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>They said therefore unto him: Who art thou, that we may give an answer to them that sent us? What sayest thou of thyself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said: I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>And they that were sent, were of the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him, and said to him: Why then dost thou baptize, if thou be not Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying: I baptize with water; but there hath stood one in the midst of you, whom you know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>The same is he that shall come after me, who is preferred before me: the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to loose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things were done in Bethania, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day, John saw Jesus coming to him, and he saith: Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who taketh away the sin of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he, of whom I said: After me there cometh a man, who is preferred before me: because he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And I knew him not, but that he may be made manifest in Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John gave testimony, saying: I saw the Spirit coming down, as a dove from heaven, and he remained upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptize with water, said to me: He upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon him, he it is that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I saw, and I gave testimony, that this is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>The next day again John stood, and two of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>And beholding Jesus walking, he saith: Behold the Lamb of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>And Jesus turning, and seeing them following him, saith to them: What seek you? Who said to him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He saith to them: Come and see. They came, and saw where he abode, and they stayed with him that day: now it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>And Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who had heard of John, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He findeth first his brother Simon, and saith to him: We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>And he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus looking upon him, said: Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is interpreted Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>On the following day, he would go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip. And Jesus saith to him: Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him: We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets did write, Jesus the son of Joseph of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said to him: Can any thing of good come from Nazareth? Philip saith to him: Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him: and he saith of him: Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael saith to him: Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered, and said to him: Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered him, and said: Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered, and said to him: Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, thou believest: greater things than these shalt thou see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And he saith to him: Amen, amen I say to you, you shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And the third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee: and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>And Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And the wine failing, the mother of Jesus saith to him: They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>And Jesus saith to her: Woman, what is that to me and to thee? my hour is not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother saith to the waiters: Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three measures apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus saith to them: Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And Jesus saith to them: Draw out now, and carry to the chief steward of the feast. And they carried it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>And when the chief steward had tasted the water made wine, and knew not whence it was, but the waiters knew who had drawn the water; the chief steward calleth the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>And saith to him: Every man at first setteth forth good wine, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse. But thou hast kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee; and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went down to Capharnaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they remained there not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the pasch of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And he found in the temple them that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And when he had made, as it were, a scourge of little cords, he drove them all out of the temple, the sheep also and the oxen, and the money of the changers he poured out, and the tables he overthrew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And to them that sold doves he said: Take these things hence, and make not the house of my Father a house of traffic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>And his disciples remembered, that it was written: The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>The Jews, therefore, answered, and said to him: What sign dost thou shew unto us, seeing thou dost these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered, and said to them: Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jews then said: Six and forty years was this temple in building; and wilt thou raise it up in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he spoke of the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>When therefore he was risen again from the dead, his disciples remembered, that he had said this, and they believed the scripture, and the word that Jesus had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now when he was at Jerusalem, at the pasch, upon the festival day, many believed in his name, seeing his signs which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>And because he needed not that any should give testimony of man: for he knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>And there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him: Rabbi, we know that thou art come a teacher from God; for no man can do these signs which thou dost, unless God be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered, and said to him: Amen, amen I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus saith to him: How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered: Amen, amen I say to thee, unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Wonder not, that I said to thee, you must be born again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The Spirit breatheth where he will; and thou hearest his voice, but thou knowest not whence he cometh, and whither he goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered, and said to him: How can these things be done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered, and said to him: Art thou a master in Israel, and knowest not these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Amen, amen I say to thee, that we speak what we know, and we testify what we have seen, and you receive not our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I have spoken to you earthly things, and you believe not; how will you believe, if I shall speak to you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>And no man hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man be lifted up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>That whosoever believeth in him, may not perish; but may have life everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God sent not his Son into the world, to judge the world, but that the world may be saved by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He that believeth in him is not judged. But he that doth not believe, is already judged: because he believeth not in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the judgment: because the light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the light: for their works were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For every one that doth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, that his works may not be reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, because they are done in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea: and there he abode with them, and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>And John also was baptizing in Ennon near Salim; because there was much water there; and they came and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>And there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews concerning purification:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to John, and said to him: Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony, behold he baptizeth, and all men come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered, and said: A man cannot receive any thing, unless it be given him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves do bear me witness, that I said, I am not Christ, but that I am sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with joy because of the bridegroom's voice. This my joy therefore is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, but I must decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He that cometh from above, is above all. He that is of the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh. He that cometh from heaven, is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth: and no man receiveth his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God: for God doth not give the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loveth the Son: and he hath given all things into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He that believeth in the Son, hath life everlasting; but he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>When Jesus therefore understood that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus maketh more disciples, and baptizeth more than John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>He left Judea, and went again into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>And he was of necessity to pass through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, which is called Sichar, near the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>There cometh a woman of Samaria, to draw water. Jesus saith to her: Give me to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>For his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>Then that Samaritan woman saith to him: How dost thou, being a Jew, ask of me to drink, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered, and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God, and who he is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman saith to him: Sir, thou hast nothing wherein to draw, and the well is deep; from whence then hast thou living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered, and said to her: Whosoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again; but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him, shall not thirst for ever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>But the water that I will give him, shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman saith to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 17 The woman answered, and said: I have no husband. Jesus said to her: Thou hast said well, I have no husband:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>dummy verses inserted by amos</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>For thou hast had five husbands: and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband. This thou hast said truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman saith to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers adored on this mountain, and you say, that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus saith to her: Woman, believe me, that the hour cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, not in Jerusalem, adore the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>You adore that which you know not: we adore that which we know; for salvation is of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeketh such to adore him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is a spirit; and they that adore him, must adore him in spirit and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman saith to him: I know that the Messias cometh (who is called Christ); therefore, when he is come, he will tell us all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus saith to her: I am he, who am speaking with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And immediately his disciples came; and they wondered that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said: What seekest thou? or, why talkest thou with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>The woman therefore left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>Come, and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They went therefore out of the city, and came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>In the mean time the disciples prayed him, saying: Rabbi, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said to them: I have meat to eat, which you know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>The disciples therefore said one to another: Hath any man brought him to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus saith to them: My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, that I may perfect his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Do you not say, There are yet four months, and then the harvest cometh? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the countries; for they are white already to harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting: that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For in this is the saying true: That it is one man that soweth, and it is another that reapeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour: others have laboured, and you have entered into their labours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>Now of that city many of the Samaritans believed in him, for the word of the woman giving testimony: He told me all things whatsoever I have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired that he would tarry there. And he abode there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed in him because of his own word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>And they said to the woman: We now believe, not for thy saying: for we ourselves have heard him, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>Now after two days, he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things he had done at Jerusalem on the festival day; for they also went to the festival day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain ruler, whose son was sick at Capharnaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to him, and prayed him to come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jesus therefore said to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you believe not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The ruler saith to him: Lord, come down before that my son die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus saith to him: Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>And as he was going down, his servants met him; and they brought word, saying, that his son lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>The father therefore knew, that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed, and his whole house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judea into Galilee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After these things was a festival day of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is at Jerusalem a pond, called Probatica, which in Hebrew is named Bethsaida, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a great multitude of sick, of blind, of lame, of withered; waiting for the moving of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>And an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water, was made whole, of whatsoever infirmity he lay under.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>And there was a certain man there, that had been eight and thirty years under his infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>Him when Jesus had seen lying, and knew that he had been now a long time, he saith to him: Wilt thou be made whole?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The infirm man answered him: Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pond. For whilst I am coming, another goeth down before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus saith to him: Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And immediately the man was made whole: and he took up his bed, and walked. And it was the sabbath that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>The Jews therefore said to him that was healed: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered them: He that made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>They asked him therefore: Who is that man who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But he who was healed, knew not who it was; for Jesus went aside from the multitude standing in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>Afterwards, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and saith to him: Behold thou art made whole: sin no more, lest some worse thing happen to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went his way, and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them: My Father worketh until now; and I work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>Hereupon therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he did not only break the sabbath, but also said God was his Father, making himself equal to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Then Jesus answered, and said to them: Amen, amen, I say unto you, the Son cannot do any thing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doth, these the Son also doth in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things which himself doth: and greater works than these will he shew him, that you may wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth life: so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For neither doth the Father judge any man, but hath given all judgment to the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>That all men may honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, who hath sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Amen, amen I say unto you, that he who heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath life everlasting; and cometh not into judgment, but is passed from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Amen, amen I say unto you, that the hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For as the Father hath life in himself, so he hath given the Son also to have life in himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>And he hath given him power to do judgment, because he is the Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Wonder not at this; for the hour cometh, wherein all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>And they that have done good things, shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I cannot of myself do any thing. As I hear, so I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You sent to John, and he gave testimony to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But I receive not testimony from man: but I say these things, that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have a greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to perfect; the works themselves, which I do, give testimony of me, that the Father hath sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father himself who hath sent me, hath given testimony of me: neither have you heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him you believe not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>Search the scriptures, for you think in them to have life everlasting; and the same are they that give testimony of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>And you will not come to me that you may have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I receive glory not from men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I am come in the name of my Father, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can you believe, who receive glory one from another: and the glory which is from God alone, you do not seek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Think not that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one that accuseth you, Moses, in whom you trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For if you did believe Moses, you would perhaps believe me also; for he wrote of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is that of Tiberias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>And a great multitude followed him, because they saw the miracles which he did on them that were diseased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>Jesus therefore went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>Now the pasch, the festival day of the Jews, was near at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>When Jesus therefore had lifted up his eyes, and seen that a very great multitude cometh to him, he said to Philip: Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>And this he said to try him; for he himself knew what he would do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered him: Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, saith to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>There is a boy here that hath five barley loaves, and two fishes; but what are these among so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Then Jesus said: Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. The men therefore sat down, in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>And Jesus took the loaves: and when he had given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down. In like manner also of the fishes, as much as they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>And when they were filled, he said to his disciples: Gather up the fragments that remain, lest they be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>They gathered up therefore, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above to them that had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>Now those men, when they had seen what a miracle Jesus had done, said: This is of a truth the prophet, that is to come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Jesus therefore, when he knew that they would come to take him by force, and make him king, fled again into the mountain himself alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>And when evening was come, his disciples went down to the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>And when they had gone up into a ship, they went over the sea to Capharnaum; and it was now dark, and Jesus was not come unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>And the sea arose, by reason of a great wind that blew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>When they had rowed therefore about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking upon the sea, and drawing nigh to the ship, and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But he saith to them: It is I; be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>They were willing therefore to take him into the ship; and presently the ship was at the land to which they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>The next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea, saw that there was no other ship there but one, and that Jesus had not entered into the ship with his disciples, but that his disciples were gone away alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>But other ships came in from Tiberias; nigh unto the place where they had eaten the bread, the Lord giving thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>When therefore the multitude saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they took shipping, and came to Capharnaum, seeking for Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him: Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered them, and said: Amen, amen I say to you, you seek me, not because you have seen miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth unto life everlasting, which the Son of man will give you. For him hath God, the Father, sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>They said therefore unto him: What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered, and said to them: This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he hath sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>They said therefore to him: What sign therefore dost thou shew, that we may see, and may believe thee? What dost thou work?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers did eat manna in the desert, as it is written: He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Then Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say to you; Moses gave you not bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For the bread of God is that which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>They said therefore unto him: Lord, give us always this bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>And Jesus said to them: I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger: and he that believeth in me shall never thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But I said unto you, that you also have seen me, and you believe not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All that the Father giveth to me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will not cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>Because I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>Now this is the will of the Father who sent me: that of all that he hath given me, I should lose nothing; but should raise it up again in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>And this is the will of my Father that sent me: that every one who seeth the Son, and believeth in him, may have life everlasting, and I will raise him up in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>The Jews therefore murmured at him, because he had said: I am the living bread which came down from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>And they said: Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then saith he, I came down from heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus therefore answered, and said to them: Murmur not among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No man can come to me, except the Father, who hath sent me, draw him; and I will raise him up in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It is written in the prophets: And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath heard of the Father, and hath learned, cometh to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>Not that any man hath seen the Father; but he who is of God, he hath seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>Amen, amen I say unto you: He that believeth in me, hath everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your fathers did eat manna in the desert, and are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>This is the bread which cometh down from heaven; that if any man eat of it, he may not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the living bread which came down from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever; and the bread that I will give, is my flesh, for the life of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying: How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>Then Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say unto you: Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath everlasting life: and I will raise him up in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>For my flesh is meat indeed: and my blood is drink indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, abideth in me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me, the same also shall live by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>This is the bread that came down from heaven. Not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead. He that eateth this bread, shall live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>These things he said, teaching in the synagogue, in Capharnaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>Many therefore of his disciples, hearing it, said: This saying is hard, and who can hear it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>But Jesus, knowing in himself, that his disciples murmured at this, said to them: Doth this scandalize you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>If then you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>It is the spirit that quickeneth: the flesh profiteth nothing. The words that I have spoken to you, are spirit and life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning, who they were that did not believe, and who he was, that would betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>And he said: Therefore did I say to you, that no man can come to me, unless it be given him by my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>After this many of his disciples went back; and walked no more with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Then Jesus said to the twelve: Will you also go away?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>And Simon Peter answered him: Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>And we have believed and have known, that thou art the Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>Jesus answered them: Have not I chosen you twelve; and one of you is a devil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.72'>Now he meant Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon: for this same was about to betray him, whereas he was one of the twelve.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>And his brethren said to him: Pass from hence, and go into Judea; that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou dost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, manifest thyself to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>For neither did his brethren believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Then Jesus said to them: My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth: because I give testimony of it, that the works thereof are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.8'>Go you up to this festival day, but I go not up to this festival day: because my time is not accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>When he had said these things, he himself stayed in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day, and said: Where is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him. For some said: He is a good man. And others said: No, but he seduceth the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>Yet no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>And the Jews wondered, saying: How doth this man know letters, having never learned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>Jesus answered them, and said: My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If any man do the will of him; he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and there is no injustice in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Did Moses not give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>Why seek you to kill me? The multitude answered, and said: Thou hast a devil; who seeketh to kill thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>Jesus answered, and said to them: One work I have done; and you all wonder:</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, maketh thyself God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law: I said you are gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>If he called them gods, to whom to word of God was spoken, and the scripture cannot be broken;</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now there was a certain man sick, named Lazarus, of Bethania, of the town of Mary and Martha her sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>(And Mary was she that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair: whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>His sisters therefore sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>And Jesus hearing it, said to them: This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of God may be glorified by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister Mary, and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he still remained in the same place two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after that, he said to his disciples: Let us go into Judea again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples say to him: Rabbi, the Jews but now sought to stone thee: and goest thou thither again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours of the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>These things he said; and after that he said to them: Lazarus our friend sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>His disciples therefore said: Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>But Jesus spoke of his death; and they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there, that you may believe: but let us go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>Jesus therefore came, and found that he had been four days already in the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>(Now Bethania was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Martha therefore, as soon as she heard that Jesus had come, went to meet him: but Mary sat at home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Martha therefore said to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But now also I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus saith to her: Thy brother shall rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha saith to him: I know that he shall rise again, in the resurrection at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, although he be dead, shall live:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>And every one that liveth, and believeth in me, shall not die for ever. Believest thou this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She saith to him: Yea, Lord, I have believed that thou art Christ the Son of the living God, who art come into this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And when she had said these things, she went, and called her sister Mary secretly, saying: The master is come, and calleth for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>She, as soon as she heard this, riseth quickly, and cometh to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>For Jesus was not yet come into the town: but he was still in that place where Martha had met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews therefore, who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose up speedily and went out, followed her, saying: She goeth to the grave to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>When Mary therefore was come where Jesus was, seeing him, she fell down at his feet, and saith to him: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews that were come with her, weeping, groaned in the spirit, and troubled himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>And said: Where have you laid him? They say to him: Lord, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>And Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>The Jews therefore said: Behold how he loved him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But some of them said: Could not he that opened the eyes of the man born blind, have caused that this man should not die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre. Now it was a cave; and a stone was laid over it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus saith: Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him: Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he is now of four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus saith to her: Did not I say to thee, that if thou believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifting up his eyes said: Father, I give thee thanks that thou hast heard me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>And I knew that thou hearest me always; but because of the people who stand about have I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>When he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice: Lazarus, come forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>And presently he that had been dead came forth, bound feet and hands with winding bands; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many therefore of the Jews, who were come to Mary and Martha, and had seen the things that Jesus did, believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them the things that Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>The chief priests therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered a council, and said: What do we, for this man doth many miracles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let him alone so, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest that year, said to them: You know nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>And this he spoke not of himself: but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of God, that were dispersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>From that day therefore they devised to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but he went into a country near the desert, unto a city that is called Ephrem, and there he abode with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>And the pasch of the Jews was at hand; and many from the country went up to Jerusalem, before the pasch to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>They sought therefore for Jesus; and they discoursed one with another, standing in the temple: What think you that he is not come to the festival day? And the chief priests and Pharisees had given a commandment, that if any man knew where he was, he should tell, that they might apprehend him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Jesus therefore, six days before the pasch, came to Bethania, where Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus raised to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>And they made him a supper there: and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that were at table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard, of great price, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, he that was about to betray him, said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the purse, carried the things that were put therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Jesus therefore said: Let her alone, that she may keep it against the day of my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For the poor you have always with you; but me you have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus also:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>Because many of the Jews, by reason of him, went away, and believed in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>And on the next day, a great multitude that was to come to the festival day, when they had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried: Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jesus found a young ass, and sat upon it, as it is written:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy king cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>These things his disciples did not know at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>The multitude therefore gave testimony, which was with him, when he called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>For which reason also the people came to meet him, because they heard that he had done this miracle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves: Do you see that we prevail nothing? behold, the whole world is gone after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now there were certain Gentiles among them, who came up to adore on the festival day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>These therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying: Sir, we would see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip cometh, and telleth Andrew. Again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Amen, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>Itself remaineth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, keepeth it unto life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If any man minister to me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any man minister to me, him will my Father honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came unto this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify thy name. A voice therefore came from heaven: I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The multitude therefore that stood and heard, said that it thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered, and said: This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of the world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>(Now this he said, signifying what death he should die.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law, that Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou: The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while, the light is among you. Walk whilst you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>Whilst you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things Jesus spoke; and he went away, and hid himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>And whereas he had done so many miracles before them, they believed not in him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>That the saying of Isaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said: Lord, who hath believed our hearing? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaias said again:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>These things said Isaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>However, many of the chief men also believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, that they might not be cast out of the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>But Jesus cried, and said: He that believeth in me, doth not believe in me, but in him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I am come a light into the world; that whosoever believeth in me, may not remain in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And if any man hear my words, and keep them not, I do not judge him: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He that despiseth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that his commandment is life everlasting. The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father said unto me, so do I speak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.12'>Then the band and the tribune, and the servants of the Jews, took Jesus, and bound him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.13'>And they led him away to Annas first, for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high priest of that year.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.20'>Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world: I have always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither all the Jews resort; and in secret I have spoken nothing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They answered, and said to him: If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Pilate therefore went into the hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him: Art thou the king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus answered: Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or have others told it thee of me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Thy own nation, and the chief priests, have delivered thee up to me: what hast thou done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would certainly strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from hence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate therefore said to him: Art thou a king then? Jesus answered: Thou sayest that I am a king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world; that I should give testimony to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate saith to him: What is truth? And when he said this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them: I find no cause in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But you have a custom that I should release one unto you at the pasch: will you, therefore, that I release unto you the king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>Then cried they all again, saying: Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then therefore, Pilate took Jesus, and scourged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers platting a crown of thorns, put it upon his head; and they put on him a purple garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>And they came to him, and said: Hail, king of the Jews; and they gave him blows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith to them: Behold, I bring him forth unto you, that you may know that I find no cause in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>(Jesus therefore came forth, bearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment.) And he saith to them: Behold the Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When the chief priests, therefore, and the servants, had seen him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Take him you, and crucify him: for I find no cause in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered him: We have a law; and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilate therefore had heard this saying, he feared the more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>And he entered into the hall again, and he said to Jesus: Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Pilate therefore saith to him: Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and I have power to release thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered: Thou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above. Therefore, he that hath delivered me to thee, hath the greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>And from henceforth Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews cried out, saying: If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar's friend. For whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>Now when Pilate had heard these words, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat, in the place that is called Lithostrotos, and in Hebrew Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>And it was the parasceve of the pasch, about the sixth hour, and he saith to the Jews: Behold your king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out: Away with him; away with him; crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered: We have no king but Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And bearing his own cross, he went forth to that place which is called Calvary, but in Hebrew Golgotha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>Where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate wrote a title also, and he put it upon the cross. And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>This title therefore many of the Jews did read: because the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am the King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered: What I have written, I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified him, took his garments, (and they made four parts, to every soldier a part,) and also his coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>They said then one to another: Let us not cut it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled, saying: They have parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they have cast lot. And the soldiers indeed did these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>When Jesus therefore had seen his mother and the disciple standing whom he loved, he saith to his mother: Woman, behold thy son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>After that, he saith to the disciple: Behold thy mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>Afterwards, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said: I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>Now there was a vessel set there full of vinegar. And they, putting a sponge full of vinegar and hyssop, put it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>Jesus therefore, when he had taken the vinegar, said: It is consummated. And bowing his head, he gave up the ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>Then the Jews, (because it was the parasceve,) that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath day, (for that was a great sabbath day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>The soldiers therefore came; and they broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But after they were come to Jesus, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers with a spear opened his side, and immediately there came out blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he that saw it, hath given testimony, and his testimony is true. And he knoweth that he saith true; that you also may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled: You shall not break a bone of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another scripture saith: They shall look on him whom they pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea (because he was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews) besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And Nicodemus also came, (he who at the first came to Jesus by night,) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>They took therefore the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now there was in the place where he was crucified, a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein no man yet had been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>There, therefore, because of the parasceve of the Jews, they laid Jesus, because the sepulchre was nigh at hand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>And on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalen cometh early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre; and she saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>She ran, therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to them: They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter therefore went out, and that other disciple, and they came to the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>And they both ran together, and that other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>And when he stooped down, he saw the linen cloths lying; but yet he went not in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then cometh Simon Peter, following him, and went into the sepulchre, and saw the linen cloths lying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>And the napkin that had been about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but apart, wrapped up into one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then that other disciple also went in, who came first to the sepulchre: and he saw, and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>The disciples therefore departed again to their home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood at the sepulchre without, weeping. Now as she was weeping, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>And she saw two angels in white, sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>They say to her: Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them: Because they have taken away my Lord; and I know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing; and she knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus saith to her: Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, thinking it was the gardener, saith to him: Sir, if thou hast taken him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus saith to her: Mary. She turning, saith to him: Rabboni (which is to say, Master).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus saith to her: Do not touch me, for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren, and say to them: I ascend to my Father and to your Father, to my God and your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalen cometh, and telleth the disciples: I have seen the Lord, and these things he said to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>Now when it was late that same day, the first of the week, and the doors were shut, where the disciples were gathered together, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them: Peace be to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>He said therefore to them again: Peace be to you. As the Father hath sent me, I also send you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>When he had said this, he breathed on them; and he said to them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples therefore said to him: We have seen the Lord. But he said to them: Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said: Peace be to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then he saith to Thomas: Put in thy finger hither, and see my hands; and bring hither thy hand, and put it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas answered, and said to him: My Lord, and my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus saith to him: Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and have believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>Many other signs also did Jesus in the sight of his disciples, which are not written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>But these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God: and that believing, you may have life in his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After this, Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. And he shewed himself after this manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas, who is called Didymus, and Nathanael, who was of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter saith to them: I go a fishing. They say to him: We also come with thee. And they went forth, and entered into the ship: and that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>But when the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Jesus therefore said to them: Children, have you any meat? They answered him: No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>He saith to them: Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and you shall find. They cast therefore; and now they were not able to draw it, for the multitude of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved, said to Peter: It is the Lord. Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, girt his coat about him, (for he was naked,) and cast himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the other disciples came in the ship, (for they were not far from the land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>As soon then as they came to land, they saw hot coals lying, and a fish laid thereon, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus saith to them: Bring hither of the fishes which you have now caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, one hundred and fifty-three. And although there were so many, the net was not broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus saith to them: Come, and dine. And none of them who were at meat, durst ask him: Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>And Jesus cometh and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>When therefore they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter: Simon son of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him: Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He saith to him again: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? He saith to him: Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He said to him the third time: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved, because he had said to him the third time: Lovest thou me? And he said to him: Lord, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Amen, amen I say to thee, when thou wast younger, thou didst gird thyself, and didst walk where thou wouldst. But when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldst not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>And this he said, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had said this, he saith to him: Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter turning about, saw that disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said: Lord, who is he that shall betray thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Him therefore when Peter had seen, he saith to Jesus: Lord, and what shall this man do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus saith to him: So I will have him to remain till I come, what is it to thee? follow thou me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>This saying therefore went abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. And Jesus did not say to him: He should not die; but, So I will have him to remain till I come, what is it to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is that disciple who giveth testimony of these things, and hath written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>But there are also many other things which Jesus did; which, if they were written every one, the world itself, I think, would not be able to contain the books that should be written.</verse>
