      <chapter osisID='Jer.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.1'>The words of Jeremias the son of Helcias, of the priests that were in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.2'>The word of the Lord which came to him in the days of Josias the son of Amon king of Juda, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.3'>And which came to him in the days of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, unto the end of the eleventh year of Sedecias the son of Josias king of Juda, even unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive, in the fifth month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.4'>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.5'>Before I formed thee in the bowels of thy mother, I knew thee: and before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee, and made thee a prophet unto the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.6'>And I said: Ah, ah, ah, Lord God: behold, I cannot speak, for I am a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.7'>And the Lord said to me: Say not: I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee: and whatsoever I shall command thee, thou shalt speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.8'>Be not afraid at their presence: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.9'>And the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth: and the Lord said to me: Behold I have given my words in thy mouth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.10'>Lo, I have set thee this day over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to root up, and pull down, and to waste, and to destroy, and to build, and to plant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.11'>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: What seest thou, Jeremias? And I said: I see a rod watching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.12'>And the Lord said to me: Thou hast seen well: for I will watch over my word to perform it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.13'>And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying: What seest thou? I see a boiling caldron, and the face thereof from the face of the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.14'>And the Lord said to me: from the north shall an evil break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.15'>For behold I will call together all the families of the kingdoms of the north: saith the Lord: and they shall come, and shall set every one his throne in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and upon all the walls thereof round about, and upon all the cities of Juda,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.16'>And I will pronounce my judgements against them, touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to strange gods, and have adored the work of their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.17'>Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command thee. Be not afraid at their presence : for I will make thee not to fear their countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.18'>For behold I have made thee this day a fortified city, and a pillar of iron, and a wall of brass, over all the land, to the kings of Juda, to the princes thereof, and to the priests, and to the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.19'>And they shall fight against thee, and shall not prevail: for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.1'>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.2'>Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying: Thus saith the Lord: I have remembered thee, pitying thy soul, pitying thy youth, and the love of thy espousals, when thou followedst me in the desert, in a land that is not sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.3'>Israel is holy to the Lord, the first fruits of his increase: all they that devour him offend: evils shall come upon them, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.4'>Hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all ye families of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.5'>Thus saith the Lord: What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.6'>And they have not said: Where is the Lord, that made us come up out of the land of Egypt? that led us through the desert, through a land uninhabited and unpassable, through a land of drought, and the image of death, through a land wherein no man walked, nor any man dwelt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.7'>And I brought you into the land of Carmel, to eat the fruit thereof, and the best things thereof: ad when ye entered in, you defiled my land, and made my inheritance an abomination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.8'>The priests did not say: Where is the Lord? and they that held the law knew me not, and the pastors transgressed against me: and the prophets prophesied in Baal, and followed idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.9'>Therefore will I yet contend in judgement with you, saith the Lord, and I will plead with your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.10'>Pass over to the isles of Cethim, and see: and send into Cedar, and consider diligently: and see if there hath been done any thing like this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.11'>If a nation hath changed their gods, and indeed they are not gods,: but my people have changed their glory into an idol.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.12'>Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and ye gates thereof, be very desolate, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.13'>For my people have done two evils. They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and have digged to themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.14'>Is Israel a bondman, or a homeborn slave? why then is he become prey?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.15'>The lions have roared upon him, and have made a noise, they have made his land a wilderness: his cities are burnt down and there is none to dwell in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.16'>The children also of Memphis, and of Taphnes have deflowered thee, even to the crown of the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.17'>Hath not this been done to thee, because thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God at that time, when he led thee by the way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.18'>And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the troubled water? And what hast thou to do with the way of the Assyrians, to drink the water of the river?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.19'>Thy own wickedness shall reprove thee, and thy apostasy shall rebuke thee. Know thou, and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing for thee, to have left the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not with thee, saith the Lord the God of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.20'>Of old time thou hast broken my yoke, thou hast burst my bands, and thou saidst: I will not serve. For on every high hill, and under every green tree thou didst prostitute thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.21'>Yet I planted thee a chosen vineyard, all true seed: how then art thou turned unto me into that which is good for nothing, O strange vineyard?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.22'>Though thou wash thyself with nitre, and multiply to thyself the herb borith, thou art stained in thy iniquity before me, saith the Lord God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.23'>How canst thou say: I am not polluted, and I have not walked after Baalim? see thy ways in the valley, know what thou hast done: as a swift runner pursuing his course.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.24'>A wild ass accustomed to the wilderness in the desire of his heart, snuffed up the wind of his love: none shall turn her away: all that seek her shall not fail: in her monthly filth they shall find her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.25'>Keep thy foot from being bare, and thy throat from thirst. But thou saidst: I have lost all hope, I will not do it: for I have loved strangers, and I will walk after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.26'>As the thief is confounded when he is taken, so is the house of Israel confounded, they and their kings, their princes and their priests, and their prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.27'>Saying to a stock: Thou art my father: and to a stone: thou hast begotten me: they have turned their back to me, and not their face: and in the time of their affliction they will say: Arise, and deliver us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.28'>Where are the gods, whom thou hast made thee? let them arise and deliver thee in the time of thy affliction: for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.29'>Why will you contend with me in judgement? you have all forsaken me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.30'>In vain have I struck your children, they have not received correction: your sword hath devoured your prophets, your generation is like a ravaging lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.31'>See ye the word of the Lord: Am I become a wilderness to Israel, or a lateward springing land? why then have my people said: We are revolted, we will come to thee no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.32'>Will a virgin forget her ornament, or a bride her stomacher? but my people hath forgotten me days without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.33'>Why dost thou endeavor to shew thy way good to seek my love, thou who has also taught thy malices to be thy ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.34'>And in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor and innocent? not in ditches have I found them, but in all places, which I mentioned before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.35'>And thou hast said: I am without sin and am innocent: and therefore let thy anger be turned away from me. Behold, I will contend with thee in judgement, because thou hast said: I have not sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.36'>How exceeding base art thou become, going the same ways over again! and thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.37'>For from thence thou shalt go, and thy hand shall be upon thy head: for the Lord hath destroyed thy trust, and thou shalt have nothing prosperous therein.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.1'>It is commonly said: If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and marry another man, shall he return to her any more? shall not that woman be polluted, and defiled? but thou hast prostituted thyself to many lovers: nevertheless return to me, saith the Lord, and I will receive thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.2'>Lift up thy eyes on high: and see where thou hast not prostuted thyself: Thou didst sit in the ways, waiting for them as a robber in the wilderness: and thou hast polluted the land with thy fornications, and with thy wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.3'>Therefore the showers were withholden, and there was no lateward rain: thou hadst a harlot's forehead, thou wouldst not blush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.4'>Therefore at least at this time call to me: Thou art my father, the guide of my virginity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.5'>Wilt thou be angry for ever, or wilt thou continue until the end? Behold, thou hast spoken, and hast done evil things, and hast been able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.6'>And the Lord said to me in the days of king Josias: Hast thou seen what rebellious Israel hast done? she hath gone out of herself upon every high mountain, and under every green tree, and hath played the harlot there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.7'>And when she had done all these things, I said: Return to me, and she did not return. And her treacherous sister Juda saw,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.8'>That because the rebellious Israel had played the harlot, I had put her away, and had given her a bill of divorce: yet her treacherous sister Juda was not afraid, but went and played the harlot also herself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.9'>And by the facility of her fornication she defiled the land, and played the harlot with stones and with stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.10'>And after all this, her treacherous sister Juda hath not returned to me with her whole heart, but with falsehood, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.11'>And the Lord said to me: The rebellious Israel hath justified her soul, in comparison of the treacherous Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.12'>Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and thou shalt say: Return, O rebellious Israel, saith the Lord, and I will not turn away my face from you: for I am holy, saith the Lord, and I will not be angry for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.13'>But yet acknowledge thy iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God: and thou hast scattered thy ways to strangers under every green tree, and hast not heard my voice, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.14'>Return, O ye revolting children, saith the Lord: for I am your husband: and I will take you, one of a city, and two of a kindred, and will bring you into Sion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.15'>And I will give you pastors according to my own heart, and they shall feed you with knowledge and doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.16'>And when you shall be multiplied, and increase in the land in those days, saith the Lord, they shall say no more: The ark of the covenant of the Lord: neither shall it come upon the heart, neither shall they remember it, neither shall it be visited, neither shall that be done any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.17'>At that time Jerusalem shall be called the thrown of the Lord: and all the nations shall be gathered together to it, in the name of the Lord to Jerusalem, and they shall not walk after the perversity of their most wicked heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.18'>In those days the house of Juda shall go to the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land which I gave to your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.19'>But I said: How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a lovely land, the goodly inheritance of the armies of the Gentiles? And I said: Thou shalt call me father and shalt cease to walk after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.20'>But as a woman that despiseth her lover, so hath the house of Israel despised me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.21'>A voice was heard in the highways, weeping and howling of the children of Israel: because they have made their way wicked, they have forgotten the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.22'>Return, you rebellious children, and I will heal your rebellions. Behold we come to thee: for thou art the Lord our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.23'>In very deed the hills were liars. and the multitude of the mountains: truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.24'>Confusion hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.25'>We shall sleep in our confusion, and our shame shall cover us, because we have sinned against the Lord our God, we and our fathers from our youth even to this day, and we have not hearkened to the voice of theLord our God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.1'>If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, return to me: if thou wilt take away thy stumblingblocks out of my sight, thou shalt not be moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.2'>And thou shalt swear: As the Lord liveth, in truth, and in judgement, and in justice: and the Gentiles shall bless him, and shall praise him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.3'>For thus saith the Lord to the men of Juda and Jerusalem: Break up anew your fallow ground, and sow not upon thorns:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.4'>Be circumcised to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your hearts, ye men of Juda, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my indignation come forth like fire, and burn, and there be none that can quench it: because of the wickedness of your thoughts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.5'>Declare ye in Juda, and make it heard in Jerusalem: speak, and sound with the trumpet in the land: cry aloud, and say: Assemble yourselves, and let us go into strong cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.6'>Set up the standard in Sion. Strengthen yourselves, stay not: for I bring evil from the north, and great destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.7'>The lion is come up out of his den, and the robber of nations hath roused himself: he is come forth out of his place, to make thy land desolate: thy cities shall be laid waste, remaining without an inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.8'>For this gird yourselves with haircloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the Lord is not turned away from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.9'>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord: That the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes: and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall be amazed</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.10'>And I said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, hast thou then deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying: You shall have peace: and behold the sword reacheth even to the soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.11'>At that time it shall be said to this people, and to Jerusalem: A burning wind is in the ways that are in the desert of the way of the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.12'>A full wind from these places shall come to me: and now I will speak my judgments with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.13'>Behold he shall come up as a cloud, and his chariots as a tempest: his horses are swifter than eagles: woe unto us, for we are laid waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.14'>Wash thy heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou mayst be saved: how long shall hurtful thoughts abide in thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.15'>For a voice of one declaring from Dan, and giving notice of the idol from mount Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.16'>Say ye to the nations: Behold it is heard in Jerusalem, that guards are coming from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.17'>They are set round about her, as keepers of fields: because she hath provoked me to wrath, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.18'>They ways, and thy devices have brought these things upon thee: this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it hath touched thy heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.19'>My bowels, my bowels are in pain, the senses of my heart are troubled within me, I will not hold my peace, for my soul hath heard the sound of the trumpet, the cry of battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.20'>Destruction upon destruction is called for, and all the earth is laid waste: my tents are destroyed on a sudden, and my pavilions in a moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.21'>How long shall I see men fleeing away, how long shall I hear the sound of the trumpet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.22'>For my foolish people have not known me: they are foolish and senseless children: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.23'>I beheld the earth, and lo it was void, and nothing: and the heavens, and there was no light in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.24'>I looked upon the mountains, and behold they trembled: and all the hills were troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.25'>I beheld, and lo there was no man: and all the birds of the air were gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.26'>I looked, and behold Carmel was a wilderness: and all its cities were destroyed at the presence of the Lord, and at the presence of the wrath of his indignation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.27'>For thus saith the Lord: All the land shall be desolate, but yet I will not utterly destroy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.28'>The earth shall mourn, and the heavens shall lament from above: because I have spoken, I have purposed, and I have not repented, neither am I turned away from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.29'>At the voice of the horsemen, and the archers, all the city is fled away; they have entered into thickets and have climbed up the rocks: all the cities are forsaken, and there dwelleth not a man in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.30'>But when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do? though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, and paintest thy eyes with stibic stone, thou shalt dress thyself out in vain: thy lovers have despised thee, they will seek thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.31'>For I have heard the voice as of a woman in travail, anguishes as of a woman in labor of a child. The voice of the daughter of Sion, dying away, spreading her hands: Woe is me, for my soul hath fainted because of them that are slain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.1'>Go about through the streets of Jerusalem, and see, and consider, and seek in the broad places thereof, if you can fins a man that executeth judgement, and seeketh faith: and I will be merciful unto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.2'>And though they say: The Lord liveth; this also they will swear falsely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.3'>O Lord, thy eyes are upon truth: thou hast struck them, and they have not grieved: thou hast bruised them, and they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than the rock, and they have refused to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.4'>But I said: Perhaps these are poor and foolish, that know not the way of the Lord, the judgement of their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.5'>I will go therefore to the great men, and I will speak to them: for they known the way of the Lord, the judgement of their God: and behold these have together broken the yoke more, and have burst the bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.6'>Wherefore a lion out of the wood hath slain them, a wolf in the evening, hath spoiled them, a leopard watcheth for their cities: every one that shall go out thence shall be taken, because their transgressions are multiplied, their rebellions are strengthened.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.10.2'>Thus saith the Lord: Learn not according to the ways of the Gentiles: and be not afraid of the signs of heaven, which the heathens fear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.3'>For the laws of the people are vain: for the works of the hand of the workman hath cut a tree out of the forest with an axe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.4'>He hath decked it with silver and gold: he hath put it together with nails and hammers, that it may not fall asunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.5'>They are framed after the likeness of a palm tree, and shall not speak: they must be carried to be removed, because they cannot go. Therefore, fear them not, for they can neither do evil nor good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.6'>There is none like to thee, O Lord: thou art great and great is thy name in might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.7'>Who shall fear thee, O king of nations? for thine is the glory: among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms there is none like unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.8'>They shall all proved together to be senseless and foolish: the doctrine of their vanity is wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.9'>Silver spread into plates is brought from Tharsis, and gold from Ophaz: the work of the artificer, and of the hand of the coppersmith: violet and purple is their clothing: all these things are the work of artificers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.10'>But the Lord is the true God: he is the living God, and the everlasting king, at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his threatening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.11'>Thus then shall you say to them: The gods that have not made heaven and earth, let them perish from the earth, and from among those places that are under heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.12'>He that maketh the earth by his power, that prepareth the world by his wisdom, and stretcheth out the heavens by his knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.13'>At his voice he giveth a multitude of waters in the heaven, and lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings for rain, and bringeth for the wind out of his treasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.14'>Every man is become a fool for knowledge every artist is confounded in his graven idol: for what he hath cast is false, and there is no spirit in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.15'>They are vain things and a ridiculous work: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.16'>The portion of Jacob is not like these: for it is he who formed all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the Lord of hosts is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.17'>Gather up thy shame out of the land, thou that dwellest in a siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.18'>For thus saith the Lord: Behold I will cast away far off the inhabitants of the land at this time: and I will afflict them, so that they may be found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.19'>Woe is me for my destruction, my wound is very grievous. But I said: Truly this is my own evil, and I will bear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.20'>My tabernacle is laid waste, all my cords are broken: my children are gone out from me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.21'>Because the pastors have done foolishly, and have not sought the Lord: therefore have they not understood, and all their flock is scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.22'>Behold the sound of a noise cometh, a great commotion out of the land of the north: to make the cities of Juda a desert, and a dwelling for dragons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.23'>I know, O Lord, that the way of a man is not his: neither is it in a man to walk, and to direct his steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.24'>Correct me, O Lord, but yet with judgement: and not in fury, lest thou bring me to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.25'>Pour out thy indignation upon the nations that have not known thee, and upon the provinces that have not called upon thy name: because they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have destroyed his glory.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.11'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.1'>The word that came from the Lord to Jeremias, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.2'>Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.3'>And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Cursed is the man that shall not hearken to the words of yethis covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.4'>Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying: Hear ye my voice, and do all things that I command you: and you shall be my people, and I will be your God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.5'>That I may accomplish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. And I answered and said: Amen, O Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.6'>And the Lord said to me: Proclaim aloud all these words in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear ye the words of the covenant, and do them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.7'>For protesting I conjured your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt even to this day: rising early I conjured them, and said: Hearken ye to my voice:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.8'>And they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear: but walked every one in the perverseness of his own wicked heart: and I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.9'>And the Lord said to me: A conspiracy is found among the men of Juda, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.10'>They are returned to the former iniquities of their fathers, who refused to hear my words: so these likewise have gone after strange gods, to serve them: the house of Israel, and the house of Juda have made void my covenant, which I made with their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.11'>Wherefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring in evils upon them, which they shall not be able to escape: and they shall cry to me, and I will not hearken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.12'>And the cities of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall go, and cry to the gods to whom they offer sacrifice, and they shall not save them in the time of their affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.13'>For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Juda: and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem thou hast set up altars of confusion, altars to offer sacrifice to Baalim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.14'>Therefore, do not thou pray for this people, and do not take up praise and prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time of their cry to me, in the time of their affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.15'>What is the meaning that my beloved hath wrought muck wickedness in my house? shall the holy flesh take away from thee thy crimes, in which thou hast boasted?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.16'>The Lord called thy name, a plentiful olive tree, fair, fruitful, and beautiful: at the noise of a word, a great fire was kindled in it and the branches thereof are burnt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.17'>And the Lord of hosts that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee: for the evils of the house of Israel, and the house of Juda, which they have done to themselves, to provoke me, offering sacrifice to Baalim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.18'>But thou, O Lord, hast shewn me, and I have known: then thou shewedst me their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.19'>And I was as a meek lamb, that is carried to be a victim: and I knew not that they had devised counsels against me, saying: Let us put wood on his bread, and cut him off from the land of the living, and let his name be remembered no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.20'>But thou, O Lord of Sabaoth, who judgest justly, and triest the reins and hearts, let me see thy revenge on them: for to thee I have revealed my cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.21'>Therefore thus saith the Lord to the men of Anathoth, who seek thy life, and say: Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of the Lord, and thou shalt not die in our hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.22'>Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will visit upon them: and their young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.23'>And there shall be no remains of them: for I will bring in evil upon the men of Anathoth, the year of their visitation.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.12'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.1'>Thou indeed, O Lord, art just, if I plead with thee, but yet I will speak what is just to thee: Why doth the way of the wicked prosper: why is it well with all them that transgress, and do wickedly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.2'>Thou hast planted them, and they have taken root: they prosper and bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.3'>And thou, O Lord, hast known me, thou hast seen me, and proved my heart with thee: gather them together as sheep for a sacrifice, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.4'>How long shall the land mourn, and the herb of every field wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? The beasts and the birds are consumed: because they have said: He shall not see our last end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.5'>If thou hast wearied with running with footmen, how canst thou contend with horses? and if thou hast been secure in a land of peace, what wilt thou do in the swelling of the Jordan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.6'>For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have fought against thee, and have cried after thee with full voice: believe them not when they speak good things to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.7'>I have forsaken my house, I have left my inheritance: I have given my dear soul into the land of her enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.8'>My inheritance is become to me as a lion in the wood: is hath cried out against me, therefore have I hated it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.9'>Is my inheritance to me as a speckled bird? Is it as a bird died throughout? come ye, assemble yourselves, all the beasts of the earth, make haste to devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.10'>Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot: they have changed my delightful portion into a desolate wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.11'>They have laid it waste, and it hath mourned for me. With desolation is all the land made desolate; because there is none that considereth in the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.12'>The spoilers are come upon all the ways of the wilderness, for the sword of the Lord shall devour from one end of the land to the other end thereof: there is no peace for all flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.13'>They have sown wheat, and reaped thorns: they have received an inheritance, and it shall not profit them: you shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce wrath of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.14'>Thus saith the Lord against all my wicked neighbors, that touch the inheritance that I have shared out to my people Israel: Behold I will pluck them out of their land, and I will pluck the house of Juda out of the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.15'>And when I shall have plucked them out, I will return, and have mercy on them: and I will bring them back, every man to his inheritance, and every man to his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.16'>And it shall come to pass, if they will be taught, and will learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name: The Lord liveth, as they have taught my people to swear by baal: that they shall be built up in the midst of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.17'>But if they will not hear, I will utterly pluck out and destroy that nation, saith the Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.13'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.1'>Thus saith the Lord to me: Go, and get thee a linen girdle, and thou shalt put it about thy loins, and shalt not put it into water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.2'>And I got a girdle accoding to the word of the Lord, and put it about my loins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.3'>And the word of the Lord came to me the second time, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.4'>Take the girdle which thou hast got, which is about thy loins, and arise, and go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.5'>And I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord had commanded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.6'>And it came to pass after many days, that the Lord said to me: Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from thence the girdle, which I commanded thee to hide there.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.13.8'>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.9'>Thus saith the Lord: after this manner will I make the pride of Juda, and the great pride of Jerusalem to rot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.10'>This wicked people, that will not hear my words, and that walk in the perverseness of their heart, and have gone after strange gods to serve them, and to adore them: and they shall be as this girdle which is fit for no use.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.11'>For as the girdle sticketh close to the loins of a man, so have I brought close to me all of the house of Israel, and all the house of Juda, saith the Lord: that they might be my people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.</verse>
