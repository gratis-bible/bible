And his hand which he stretched forth against him withered: and he was not able to draw it back again to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The altar also was rent, and the ashes were poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given before in the word of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the king said to the man of God: Entreat the face of the Lord thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me. And the man of God besought the face of the Lord, and the king's hand was restored to him, and it became as it was before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king said to the man of God: Come home with me to dine, and I will make thee presents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the man of God answered the king: If thou wouldst give me half thy house I will not go with thee, nor eat bread, nor drink water in this place:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For so it was enjoined me by the word of the Lord commanding me: Thou shalt not eat bread nor drink water, nor return by the same way that thou camest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So he departed by another way, and returned not by the way that he came into Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now a certain old prophet dwelt in Bethel, and his sons came to him and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: and they told their father the words which he had spoken to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their father said to them: What way went he? His sons shewed him the way by which the man of God went, who came out of Juda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to his sons: Saddle me the ass. And when they had saddled him, he got up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under a turpentine tree: and he said to him: Art thou the man of God that camest from Juda? He answered: I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to him: Come home with me, to eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he said: I must not return, nor go with thee, neither will I eat bread, nor drink water in this place :</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because the Lord spoke to me in the word of the Lord, saying: Thou shalt not eat bread, and thou shalt not drink water there, nor return by the way thou wentest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to him: I also am a prophet like unto thee: and an angel spoke to me in the word of the Lord, saying: Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread, and drink water. He deceived him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And brought him back with him: so he ate bread and drank water in his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as they sat at table, the word of the Lord came to the prophet that brought him back:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he cried out to the man of God who came out of Juda, saying : Thus saith the Lord: Because thou hast not been obedient to the Lord, and hast not kept the commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And hast returned and eaten bread, and drunk water in the place wherein he commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat bread, nor drink water, thy dead body shall not be brought into the sepulchre of thy fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he had eaten and drunk, he saddled his ass for the prophet, whom he had brought back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he was gone, a lion found him in the way, and killed him, and his body was cast in the way: and the ass stood by him, and the lion stood by the dead body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And behold, men passing by saw the dead body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the city, wherein that old prophet dwelt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when that prophet, who had brought him back out of the way, heard of it, he said: It is the man of God, that was disobedient to the mouth of the Lord, and the Lord hath delivered him to the lion, and he hath torn him, and killed him according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to his sons: Saddle me an ass. And when they had saddled it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was gone, he found the dead body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten of the dead body, nor hurt the ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and going back brought it into the city of the old prophet, to mourn for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he laid his dead body in his own sepulchre: and they mourned over him, saying: Alas! alas ! my brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had mourned over him, he said to his sons: When I am dead, bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried: lay my bones beside his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For assuredly the word shall come to pass which he hath foretold in the word of the Lord against the altar that is in Bethel: and against all the temples of the high places, that are in the cities of Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>After these words Jeroboam came not back from his wicked way: but on the contrary he made of the meanest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he filled his hand, and he was made a priest of the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And for this cause did the house of Jeroboam sin, and was cut off and destroyed from the face of the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
