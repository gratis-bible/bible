      <chapter osisID='Zech.1'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.1'>In the eighth month, in the second year of king Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.2'>The Lord hath been exceeding angry with your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.3'>And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Turn ye to me, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will turn to you, saith the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.4'>Be not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have cried, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Turn ye from your evil ways, and from your wicked thoughts: but they did not give ear, neither did they hearken to me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.5'>Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, shall they live always?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.6'>But yet my words, and my ordinances, which I gave in charge to my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers, and they returned, and said: As the Lord of hosts thought to do to us according to our ways, and according to our devices, so he hath done to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.7'>In the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month which is called Sabath, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.8'>I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees, that were in the bottom: and behind him were horses, red, speckled, and white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.9'>And I said: What are these, my Lord ? and the angel that spoke in me, said to me: I will shew thee what these are:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.10'>And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered, and said: These are they, whom the Lord hath sent to walk through the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.11'>And they answered the angel of the Lord, that stood among the myrtle trees, and said: We have walked through the earth, and behold all the earth is inhabited, and is at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.12'>And the angel of the Lord answered, and said: O Lord of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem, and on the cities of Juda, with which thou hast been angry? this is now the seventieth year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.13'>And the Lord answered the angel, that spoke in me, good words, comfortable words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.14'>And the angel that spoke in me, said to me: Cry thou, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I am zealous for Jerusalem, and Sion with a great zeal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.15'>And I am angry with a great anger with the wealthy nations: for I was angry a little, but they helped forward the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.16'>Therefore thus saith the Lord: I will return to Jerusalem in mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the Lord of hosts: and the building line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.17'>Cry yet, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: My cities shall yet flow with good things : and the Lord will yet comfort Sion, and he will yet choose Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.18'>And I lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold four horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.19'>And I said to the angel that spoke to me: What are these? And he said to me: These are the horns that have scattered Juda, and Israel, and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.20'>And the Lord shewed me four smiths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.21'>And I said: What come these to do? and he spoke, saying: These are the horns which have scattered Juda every man apart, and none of them lifted up his head: and these are come to fray them, to cast down the horns of the nations, that have lifted up the horn upon the land of Juda to scatter it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.1'>And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold a man, with a measuring line in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.2'>And I said: Whither goest thou? and he said to me: To measure Jerusalem, and to see how great is the breadth thereof, and how great the length thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.3'>And behold the angel that spoke in me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.4'>And he said to him: Run, speak to this young man, saying: Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls, by reason of the multitude of men, and of the beasts in the midst thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.5'>And I will be to it, saith the Lord, a wall of fire round about: and I will be in glory in the midst thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.6'>O, O flee ye out of the land of the north, saith the Lord, for I have scattered you into the four winds of heaven, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.7'>O Sion, flee, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.8'>For thus saith the Lord of hosts: After the glory he hath sent me to the nations that have robbed you: for he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of my eye:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.9'>For behold I lift up my hand upon them, and they shall be a prey to those that served them: and you shall know that the Lord of hosts sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.10'>Sing praise, and rejoice, O daughter of Sion: for behold I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee: saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.11'>And many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day, and they shall be my people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee: and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.12'>And the Lord shall possess Juda his portion in the sanctified land: and he shall yet choose Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.13'>Let all flesh be silent at the presence of the Lord: for he is risen up out of his .holy habitation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.3'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.1'>And the Lord shewed me Jesus the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord: and Satan stood on his right hand to be his adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.2'>And the Lord said to Satan: The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan: and the Lord that chose Jerusalem rebuke thee: Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.3'>And Jesus was clothed with filthy garments: and he stood before the face of the angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.4'>Who answered, and said to them that stood before him, saying: Take away the filthy garments from him. And he said to him: Behold I have taken away thy iniquity, and have clothed thee with change of garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.5'>And he said: Put a clean mitre upon his head: and they put a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments, and the angel of the Lord stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.6'>And the angel of the Lord protested to Jesus, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.7'>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and Beep my charge, thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt keep my courts, and I will give thee some of them that are now present here to walk with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.8'>Hear, O Jesus thou high priest, then and thy friends that dwell before thee, for they are portending men: for behold I WILL BRING MY SERVANT THE ORIENT.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.9'>For behold the stone that I have laid before Jesus: upon one stone there are seven eyes: behold I will grave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will take away the iniquity of that land in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.10'>In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, every man shell call his friend under the vine and under the fig tree.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.4'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.1'>And the angel that spoke in me came again: and he waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.2'>And he said to me: What seest thou? And I said: I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, and its lamp upon the top of it: and the seven lights thereof upon it: and seven funnels for the lights that were upon the top thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.3'>And two olive trees over it: one upon the right side of the lamp, and the other upon the left side thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.4'>And I answered, and said to the angel that spoke in me, saying: What are these things, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.5'>And the angel that spoke in me answered, and said to me: Knowest thou not what these things are? And I said: No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.6'>And he answered, and spoke to me, saying: This is the word of the Lord to Zorobabel, saying: Not with an army, nor by might, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.7'>Who art thou, O great mountain, before Zorobabel? thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring out the chief stone, and shall give equal grace to the grace thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.8'>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.9'>The hands of Zorobabel have laid the foundations of this house, and his hands shall finish it: and you shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.10'>For who hath despised little days? and they shall rejoice, and shall see the tin plummet in the hand of Zorobabel. These are the seven eyes of the Lord, that run to and fro through the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.11'>And I answered, and said to him: What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick, and upon the left side thereof?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.12'>And I answered again, and said to him: What are the two olive branches, that are by the two golden beaks, in which are the funnels of gold?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.13'>And he spoke to me, saying: Knowest thou not what these are? And I said: No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.14'>And he said: These are two sons of oil who stand before the Lord of the whole earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.5'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.1'>And I turned and lifted up my eyes: and I saw, and behold a volume flying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.2'>And he said to me: What seest thou? And I said: I see a volume flying: the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.3'>And he said to me: This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the earth: for every thief shall be judged as is there written: and every one that sweareth in like manner shall be judged by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.4'>I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts: and it shall come to the house of the thief, and to the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, with the timber thereof, and the stones thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.5'>And the angel went forth that spoke in me, and he said to me: Lift up thy eyes, and see what this is, that goeth forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.6'>And I said: What is it? And he said: This is a vessel going forth. And he said: This is their eye in all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.7'>And behold a talent of lead was carried, and behold a woman sitting in the midst of the vessel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.8'>And he said: This is wickedness. And he cast her into the midst of the vessel, and cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.9'>And I lifted up my eyes and looked: and behold there came out two women, and wind was in their wings, and they had wings like the wings of a kite: and they lifted up the vessel between the earth and the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.10'>And I said to the angel that spoke in me: Whither do these carry the vessel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.11'>And he said to me: That a house may be built for it in the land of Sennaar, and that it may be established, and set there upon its own basis.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.6'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.1'>And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold four chariots came out from the midst of two mountains: and the mountains were mountains of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.2'>In the first chariot were red horses, and in the second chariot black horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.3'>And in the third chariot white horses, and in the fourth chariot grisled horses, and strong ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.4'>And I answered, and said to the an- gel that spoke in me: What are these, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.5'>And the angel answered, and said to me: These are the four winds of the heaven, which go forth to stand before the Lord of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.6'>That in which were the black horses went forth into the land of the north, and the white went forth after them: and the grisled went forth to the land of the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.7'>And they that were most strong, went out, and sought to go, and to run to and fro through all the earth. And he said: Go, walk throughout the earth : and they walked throughout the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.8'>And he called me, and spoke to me, saying: Behold they that go forth into the land of the north, have quieted my spirit in the land of the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.9'>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying :</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.10'>Take of them of the captivity, of Holdai, and of Tobias, and of Idaias; thou shalt come in that day, and shalt go into the house of Josias, the son of Sophonias, who came out of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.11'>And thou shalt take gold and silver: and shalt make crowns, and thou shalt set them on the head of Jesus the son of Josedec, the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.12'>And thou shalt speak to him, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, saying: BEHOLD A MAN, THE ORIENT IS HIS NAME: and under him shall he spring up, and shall build a temple to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.13'>Yea, he shall build a temple to the Lord: and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit, and rule upon his throne: and he shall be a priest upon his throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.14'>And the crowns shall be to Helem, and Tobias, and Idaias, and to Hem, the son of Sophonias, a memorial in the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.15'>And they that are far off, shall come and shall build in the temple of the Lord: and you shall know that the Lord of hosts sent me to you. But this shall come to pass, if hearing you will hear the voice of the Lord your God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.7'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.1'>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, in the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Casleu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.2'>When Sarasar, and Rogommelech, and the men that were with him, sent to the house of God, to entreat the face of the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.3'>To speak to the priests of the house of the Lord of hosts, and to the prophets, saying: Must I weep in the fifth month, or must I sanctify myself as I have now done for many years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.4'>And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.5'>Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying: When you fasted, and mourned in the fifth and the seventh month for these seventy years: did you keep a fast unto me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.6'>And when you did eat and drink, did you not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.7'>Are not these the words which the Lord spoke by the hand of the former prophets, when Jerusalem as yet was inhabited, and was wealthy, both itself and the cities round about it, and there were inhabitants towards the south, and in the plain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.8'>And the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.9'>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, saying: Judge ye true judgment, and shew ye mercy and compassion every man to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.10'>And oppress not the widow, and the fatherless, and the stranger, and the poor: and let not a man devise evil in his heart against his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.11'>But they would not hearken, and they turned away the shoulder to depart: and they stopped their ears, not to hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.12'>And they made their heart as the adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the Lord of hosts sent in his spirit by the hand of the former prophets: so a great indignation came from the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.13'>And it came to pass that as he spoke, and they heard not: so shall they cry, and I will not hear, saith the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.14'>And I dispersed them throughout all kingdoms, which they know not: and the land was left desolate behind them, so that no man passed through or returned: and they changed the delightful land into a wilderness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.8'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.1'>And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.2'>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I have been jealous for Sion with a great jealousy, and with a great indignation have I been jealous for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.3'>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I am returned to Sion, and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth, and the mountain of the Lord of hosts, The sanctified mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.4'>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem: and every man with his staff in his hand through multitude of days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.5'>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls, playing in the streets thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.6'>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: If it seem hard in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days: shall it be hard in my eyes, saith the Lord of hosts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.7'>Thus saith the Lord of hosts : Behold I will save my people from the land of the east, and from the land of the going down of the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.8'>And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God in truth and in justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.9'>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Let your hands be strengthened, you that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, in the day that the house of the Lord of hosts was founded, that the temple might be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.10'>For before those days there was no hire for men, neither was there hire for beasts, neither was there peace to him that came in, nor to him that went out, because of the tribulation: and I let all men go every one against his neighbour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.11'>But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people according to the former days, saith the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.12'>But there shall be the seed of peace: the vine shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew: and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.13'>And it shall come to pass, that as you were a curse among the Gentiles, O house of Juda, and house of Israel: so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing: fear not, let your hands be strengthened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.14'>For thus saith the Lord of hosts: As I purposed to afflict you, when your fathers had provoked me to wrath, saith the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.15'>And I had no mercy: so turning again I have thought in these days to do good to the house of Juda, and Jerusalem: fear not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.16'>These then are the things, which you shall do: Speak ye truth every one to his neighbour: judge ye truth and judgment of peace in your gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.17'>And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his friend: and love not a false oath: for all these are the things that I hate, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.18'>And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.19'>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Juda, joy, and gladness, and great solemnities: only love ye truth and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.20'>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, until people come, and dwell in many cities,</verse>
