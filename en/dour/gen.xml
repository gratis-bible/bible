      <chapter osisID='Gen.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>In the beginning God created heaven, and earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>And God said: Be light made. And light was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning were the second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>God also said: Let the waters that are under the heaven, be gathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it was so done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>And he said: Let the earth bring forth the green herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit having seed each one according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>And the evening and the morning were the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>And God said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven, to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>To shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the earth. And it was so done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>And God made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>And the evening and morning were the fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>God also said: Let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>And God created the great whales, and every living and moving creature, which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>And he blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>And the evening and morning were the fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>And God said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind, cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, according to their kinds. And it was so done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'>And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle, and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>And he said: Let us make man to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'>And God created man to his own image: to the image of God he created him: male and female he created them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'>And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>And God said: Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind, to be your meat:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>And to all the beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they may have to feed upon. And it was so done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'>And God saw all the things that he had made, and they were very good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>And every plant of the field before it spring up in the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew: for the Lord God had not rained upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>But a spring rose out the earth, watering all the surface of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>And a river went out the place of pleasure to water paradise, which from thence is divided into four heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>The name of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold groweth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>And the gold of that land is very good: there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>And the name of the second river is Gehon: the same is it that compasseth all the land of Ethiopia</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>And the name of the third river is Tigris: the same passeth along by the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise for pleasure, to dress it, and keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. for in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>And the Lord God said: It is not good for man to be alone: let us make him a help like unto himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'>And they were both naked: to wit, Adam and his wife: and were not ashamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth which the Lord God made. And he said to the woman: Why hath God commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>And the woman answered him, saying: Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise, God hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband who did eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed together fig leaves, and made themselves aprons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise at the afternoon air, Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>And the Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>And he said to him: And who hath told thee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>And Adam said: The woman, whom thou gavest me to be my companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>And the Lord God said to the woman: Why hast thou done this? And she answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>And the Lord God said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed among all cattle, and the beasts of the earth: upon thy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>To the woman also he said: I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt be under thy husband's power, and he shall have dominion over thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>And to Adam he said: Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work; with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou eat the herbs of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth, out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>And Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she was the mother of all the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife, garments of skins, and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>And he said: Behold Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil: now, therefore, lest perhaps he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>And he cast out Adam; and placed before the paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>And Adam knew Eve his wife: who conceived and brought forth Cain, saying: I have gotten a man through God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>And again she brought forth his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a husbandman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>And it came to pass after many days, that Cain offered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat: and the Lord had respect to Abel, and to his offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect: and Cain was exceedingly angry, and his countenance fell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>And the Lord said to him: Why art thou angry? and why is thy countenance fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but if ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the door? but the lust thereof shall be under thee, and thou shalt have dominion over it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go forth abroad. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy brother Abel? And he answered, I know not: am I my brother's keeper?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>And he said to him: What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>Now, therefore, cursed shalt thou be upon the earth, which hath opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield to thee its fruit: a fugitive and vagabond shalt thou be upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is greater than that I may deserve pardon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth, and I shall be hidden from thy face, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth: everyone, therefore, that findeth me, shall kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>And the Lord said to him: No, it shall not be so: but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall be punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, that whosoever found him should not kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>And Cain went out from the face of the Lord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth, at the east side of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and brought forth Henoch: and he built a city, and called the name thereof by the name of his son Henoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad begot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and Mathusael begot Lamech:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>Who took two wives: the name of the one was Ada, and the name of the other was Sella.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of them that play upon the harp and the organs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who was a hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Noema.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sell: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the wounding of myself, and a stripling to my own bruising.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for Cain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>Adam also knew his wife again: and she brought forth a son, and called his name Seth, saying: God hath given me another seed, for Abel whom Cain slew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>But to Seth also was born a son, whom he called Enos; this man began to call upon the name of the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.1'>This is the book of the generation of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him to the likeness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.2'>He created them male and female; and blessed them: and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.3'>And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son to his own image and likeness, and called his name Seth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.4'>And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth, were eight hundred years: and he begot sons and daughters.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.23.15'>My lord, hear me. The ground which thou desirest, is worth four hundred sicles of silver: this is the price between me and thee: but what is this? bury thy dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.23.16'>And when Abraham had heard this, he weighed out the money that Ephron had asked, in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred sicles of silver of common current money.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.5'>And said to them: I see your father's countenance is not towards me as yesterday and the other day: but the God of my father hath been with me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.7'>Yea, your father also hath overreached me, and hath changes my wages ten times: and yet God hath not suffered him to hurt me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.8'>If at any time he said: The speckled shall be thy wages: all the sheep brought forth speckled: but when he said on the contrary: Thou shalt take all the white ones for thy wages: all the flocks brought forth white ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.9'>And God hath taken your father's substance, and given it to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.10'>For after that time came of the ewes conceiving, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in my sleep that the males which leaped upon the females were of diverse colors, and spotted, and speckled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.13'>I am the God of Bethel, where thou didst anoint the stone, and make a vow to me. Now therefore arise, and go out of this land, and return into thy native country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.14'>And Rachel and Lia answered: Have we anything left among the goods and inheritance of our father's house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.15'>Hath he not counted us as strangers and sold us, and eaten up the price of us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.16'>But God hath taken our father's riches, and delivered them to us, and to our children: wherefore do all that God hath commanded thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.17'>Then Jacob rose up, and having set his children and wives upon camels, went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.18'>And he took all his substance, and flocks, and whatsoever he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and went forward to Isaac his father to the land of Chanaan.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.25'>Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and when he with his brethren had overtaken him, he pitched his tent in the same mount of Galaad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.26'>And he said to Jacob: Why hast thou done thus, to carry away, without my knowledge, my daughters, as captives taken with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.27'>Why wouldst thou run away privately and not acquaint me, that I might have brought thee on the way with joy, and with songs, and with timbrels, and with harps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.28'>Thou hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and daughters: thou hast done foolishly: and now, indeed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.29'>It is in my power to return thee evil: but the God of your father said to me yesterday: Take heed thou speak not any things harshly against Jacob.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.32'>But whereas thou chargest me with theft: with whomsoever thou shalt find thy gods, let him be slain before our brethren. Search, and if thou find any of thy things with me, take them away. Now when he said this, he knew not that Rachel had stolen the idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.33'>So Laban went into the tent of Jacob, and of Lia, and of both the handmaids, and found them not. And when he was entered into Rachel's tent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.34'>She in haste hid the idols under the camel's furniture, and sat upon them: and when he had searched all the tent, and found nothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.35'>She said: Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee, because it has now happened to me, according to the custom of women, So his careful search was in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.36'>And jacob being angry, said in a chiding manner: For what fault of mine, and for what offense on my part hast thou so hotly pursued me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.37'>And searched all my household stuff? What hast thou found of all the substance of thy house? lay it here before my brethren, and thy brethren, and let them judge between me and thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.38'>Have I therefore been with thee twenty years? thy ewes and goats were not barren, the rams of thy flocks I did not eat:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.41'>And in this manner have I served thee in thy house twenty years, fourteen for thy daughters, and six for thy flocks: thou hast changed also my wages ten times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.42'>Unless the God of my father Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had stood by me, peradventure now thou hadst sent me away naked: God beheld my affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesterday.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.43'>Laban answered him: The daughters are mine and the children, and thy flocks, and all things that thou seest are mine: what can I do to my children, and grandchildren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.44'>Come therefore, let us enter into a league: that it may be for a testimony between me and thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.45'>And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a title:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.46'>And he said to his brethren: Bring hither stones. And they gathering stones together, made a heap, and they ate upon it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.53'>The God of Abraham, and the God of Nachor, the God of their father, judge between us. And jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.32.9'>And Jacob said: O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, who saidst to me: Return to thy land and to the place of thy birth, and I will do well for thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.10'>I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of thy truth which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant. With my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I return with two companies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.11'>Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am greatly afraid of him: lest perhaps he come, and kill the mother with the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.12'>Thou didst say that thou wouldst do well by me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.13'>And when he had slept there that night, he set apart, of the things which he had, presents for his brother Esau.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.14'>Two hundred she goats, twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.32.17'>And he commanded the first, saying: If thou meet my brother Esau, and he ask thee: Whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or whose are these before thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.18'>Thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob's: he hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau: and he cometh after us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.19'>In like manner he commanded the second and the third, and all that followed with the droves, saying: Speak ye the same words to Esau, when ye find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.20'>And ye shall add: thy servant Jacob himself also followeth after us: for he said: I will appease him with the presents that go before, and afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be gracious to me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.40.2'>And Pharao being angry with them (now the one was chief butler, the other chief baker)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.3'>He sent them to the prison of the commander of the soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.4'>But the keeper of the prison delivered them to Joseph, and he served them. Some little time passed, and they were kept in custody.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.5'>And they both dreamed a dream the same night, according to the interpretation agreeing to themselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.6'>And when Joseph was come in to them in the morning, and saw them sad,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.7'>He asked them, saying: Why is your oountenance sadder to day than usual?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.8'>They answered: We have dreamed a dream, and there is nobody to interpret it to us. And Joseph said to them: Both not interpretation belong to God? Tell me what you have dreamed. g The chief butler first told his dream: I saw before me a vine,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.40.10'>On which were three branches, which by little and little sent out buds, and after the blossoms brought forth ripe grapes :</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.11'>And the cup of Pharao was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into the cup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.12'>Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three branches are yet three days:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.13'>After which Pharao will remember thy service, and will restore thee to thy former place: and thou shah present him the cup according to thy office, as before thou wast wont to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.14'>Only remember me, when it shall be well with thee, and do me this kindness: to put Pharao in mind to take me out of this prison:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.40.16'>For I was stolen away out of the land I of the Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast into the dungeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.18'>The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a dream, That I bed three baskets of meal upon my heed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.19'>And that in one basket which was uppermost, I carried all meats that are made by the art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.41'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.1'>After two years Pharao had a dream. He thought he stood by the river,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.2'>Out of which came up seven kine, very beautiful and fat: and they fed in marshy places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.3'>Other seven also came up out of the river, ill favoured, and leanfleshed: and they fed on the very bank of the river, in green places:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.4'>And they devoured them, whose bodies were very beautiful and well conditioned. So Pharao awoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.5'>dummy verses inserted by amos</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.6'>He slept again, and dreamed another dream: Seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk full and fair:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.8'>Then seven other ears sprung up thin and blasted,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.9'>And devoured all the beauty of the former. Pharao awaked after his rest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.10'>And when morning was come, being struck with fear, he sent to all the interpreters of Egypt, and to all the wise men: and they being called for, he told them his dream, and there was not any one that could interpret it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.11'>Then at length the chief butler remembering, said: I confess my sin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.12'>The king being angry with his servants, commanded me and the chief baker to be cast into the prison of the captain of the soldiers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.13'>Where in one night both of us dreamed a dream foreboding things to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.14'>There was there a young man a Hebrew, servant to the same captain of the soldiers: to whom we told our dreams,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.15'>And we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be so. For I was restored to my office: and he was hanged upon a gibbet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.16'>Forthwith at the king's command, Joseph was brought out of the prison, and they shaved him, and changing his apparel, brought him in to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.17'>And he said to him: I have dreamed dreams, and there is no one that can expound them: Now I have heard that thou art very wise at interpreting them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.18'>Joseph answered: Without me, God shall give Pharao a prosperous answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.19'>So Pharao told what he had dreamed: Methought I stood upon the bank of the river,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.20'>And seven kine came up out of the river exceeding beautiful and full of flesh: and they grazed on green places in a marshy pasture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.21'>And behold, there followed these, other seven kine, so very ill favoured and lean, that I never saw the like in the land of Egypt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.22'>And the devoured and consumed the former,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.23'>And yet gave no mark of their being full: but were as lean and ill favoured as before. I awoke, and then fell asleep again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.24'>And dreamed a dream: Seven ears of corn grew upon one stalk, full and very fair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.25'>Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung of the stock:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.26'>And they devoured the beauty of the former: I told this dream to the conjecturers, and there is no man that can expound it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.27'>Joseph answered: The king's dream is one: God hath shewn to Pharao what he is about to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.28'>The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full ears, are seven years of plenty: and both contain the same meaning of the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.29'>And the seven lean and thin kine that came up after them, and the seven thin ears that were blasted with the burning wind, are seven years of famine to come:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.30'>Which shall be fulfilled in this order:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.31'>Behold, there shall come seven years of great plenty in the whole land of Egypt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.32'>After which shall follow other seven years of so great scacity, that all the abundance before shall be forgotten: for the famine shall consume all the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.33'>And the greatness of the scarcity shall destroy the greatness of the plenty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.34'>And for that thou didst see the second time a dream pertaining to the same thing: it is a token of the certainty, and that the word of God cometh to pass, and is fulfilled speedily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.35'>Now therefore let the king provide a wise and industrious man, and make him ruler over the land of Egypt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.36'>That he may appoint overseers over all the countries: and gather into barns the fifth part of the fruits, during the seven fruitful years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.37'>That shall now presently ensue: and let all the corn be laid up under Pharao's hands and be reserved in the cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.38'>And let it be in readiness, against the famine of seven years to come, which shall oppress Egypt, and the land shall not consumed with scarcity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.39'>The counsel pleased Pharao and all his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.40'>And he said to them: Can we find such another man, that is full of the spirit of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.41'>He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God hath shewn thee all that thou hast said, can I find one wiser and one like unto thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.42'>Thou shalt be over my house, and at the commandment of thy mouth all the people shall obey: only in the kingly throne will I be above thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.43'>And again Pharao said to Joseph: Behold, I have appointed thee over the whole land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.44'>And he took his ring from his own hand, and gave it into his hand: and he put upon him a robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.45'>And he made him go up into his second chariot, the crier proclaiming that all should bow their knee before him, and that they should know he was made govenor over the whole land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.46'>And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharao; without thy commandment no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.47'>And he turned his name, and called him in the Eyyptian tounge, The saviour of the world. And he gave him to wife Asenth the daughter of Putiphare priest of Heliopolis. Then Joseph went out to the land of Egypt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.48'>(Now he was thirty years old when he stood before king Pharao) and he went round all the countries of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.49'>And the fruitfulness of the seven years came: and the corm being bound up into sheaves was gathered together into the barns of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.50'>And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.51'>And there was so great abundance of wheat, that it was equal to the sand of the sea, and the plenty exceeded measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.52'>And before the famine came, Joseph had two sons born: whom Aseneth the daughter of Putiphare priest of Heliopolis bore unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.53'>And he called the name of the first born Manasses, saying: God hath made me to forget all my labours, and my father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.54'>And he named the second Epharaim, saying: God hath made me to grow in the land of my poverty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.55'>Now when the seven years of the plenty that had been in Egypt were past:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.56'>The seven years of scarcity, which Joseph had foretold, began to come: and the famine prevailed in the whole world, but there was bread in all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.57'>And when there also they began to be famished, the people cried to Pharao for food. And he said to them: Go to Joseph: and do all that he shall say to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.58'>And the famine increased daily in all the land: and Joseph opened all the barns, and sold to the Egyptians: for the famine had oppressed them also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.59'>And all provinces came into Egypt, to buy food, and to seek some relief of their want.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.42'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.1'>And Jacob hearing that food was sold in Egypt, said to his sons: Why are ye careless?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.2'>I have heard that wheat is sold in Egypt: go ye down, and buy us necessaries, that we may live, and not be consumed with want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.3'>So the ten brethren of Joseph went down, to buy corn in Egypt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.4'>Whilst Benjamin was kept at home by Jacob, who said to his brethren: Lest perhaps he take any harm in the journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.5'>And they entered into the land of Egypt with others that went to buy. For the famine was in the land of Chanaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.6'>And Joseph was governor in the land of Egypt, and corn was sold by his direction to the people. And when his brethren had bowed down to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.7'>And he knew them, he spoke as it were to strangers somewhat roughly, asking them: Whence came you? They answered: From the land of Chanaan, to buy necessaries of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.8'>And though he knew his brethren, he was not known by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.9'>And remembering the dreams, which formerly he had dreamed, he said to them: You are spies. You are come to view the weaker parts of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.10'>But they said: It is not so, my lord, but thy servants are come to buy food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.11'>We are all the sons of one man: we are come as peaceable men, neither do thy servants go about any evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.12'>And he answered them: It is otherwise: you are come to consider the unfenced parts of this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.13'>But they said: We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Chanaan: the youngest is with our father, the other is not living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.14'>He saith: This is it that I said: You are spies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.15'>I shall now presently try what you are: by the health of Pharao you shall not depart hence, until your youngest brother come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.16'>Send one of you to fetch him: and you shall be in prison, till what you have said be proved, whether it be true or false: or else by the health of Pharao you are spies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.17'>So he put them in prison three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.18'>And the third day he brought them out of prison, and said: Do as I have said, and you shall live: for I fear God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.19'>If you be peaceable men, let one of your brethren be bound in prison: and go ye your ways and carry the corn that you have bought, unto your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.20'>And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may find your words to be true, and you may not die. They did as he had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.21'>And they talked one to another: We deserve to suffer these things, because we have sinned against our brother, seeing the anguished of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this affliction come upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.22'>And Ruben one of them, said: Did not I say to you: Do not sin against the boy: and you would not hear me? Behold his blood is required.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.23'>And they knew not that Joseph understood, because he spoke to them by an interpreter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.24'>And he turned himself away a little while, and wept: and returning he spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.25'>And taking Simeon, and binking him in their presence, he commanded his servants to fill their sacks with wheat, and to put every man's money again in their sacks, and to give them besides provisions for the way: and they did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.26'>But they having loaded their asses with the corn, went their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.27'>And one of them opening his sack, to give his beast provender in the inn, saw the money in the sack's mouth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.28'>And said to his brethren: My money is given me again, hehold it is in the sack. And thye were astonished, and troubled, and said to one another: What is this that God hath done unto us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.29'>And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Chanaan, and they told him all things that had befallen them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.30'>The lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us to be spies of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.31'>And we answered him: We are peaceable men, and we mean no plot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.32'>We are twelve brethren born of one father: one is not living, the youngest is with our father in the land of Chanaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.33'>And he said to us: Hereby shall I know that you are peaceable men: Leave one of your brethren with me, and take ye necessary provision for your houses, and go your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.34'>And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know you are not spies: and you may receive this man again, that is kept in prison: and afterwards may have leave to buy what you will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.35'>When they had told this, they poured out their corn and every man found his money tied in the mouth of his sack: and all being astonished together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.36'>Their father Jacob said: You have made me to be without children: Joseph is not living, Simeon is kept in bonds, and Benjamin you will take away: all these evils are fallen upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.37'>And Ruben answered him: Kill my two sons if I bring him not again to thee: deliver him unto my hand, and I will restore him to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.38'>But he said: My son shall not go down with you: his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if any mischief befall him in the land to which you go, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to hell.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.43'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.1'>In the mean time the famine was heavy upon all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.2'>And when they had eaten up all the corn, which they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob said to his sons: Go again and buy us a little food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.3'>Juda answered: The man declared unto us with the atteststion of an oath, saying: You shall not see my face, unless you bring your youngest brother with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.4'>If therefore thou wilt send him with us, we will set out together, and will buy necessaries for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.5'>But if thou wilt not, we will not go: for the man, as we have often said, declared unto us, saying: You shall not see my face without your youngest brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.6'>Israel said to them: You have done this for my misery in that you told him you had also another brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.7'>But they answered: The man asked us in order concerning our kindred: if our father lived: if we had a brother: and we answered him regularly, according to what he demanded: Bring hither your brother with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.8'>And Juda said to his father: Send the bou with me, that we may set forward, and may live: lest both we and our children perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.9'>I take the boy upon me, require him at my hand: unless I bring him again, and restore him to thee, I will be guilty of sin against thee for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.10'>If delay had not been made, we had been here again the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.11'>Then Israel said to them: If it must needs be so, do what you will: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down presents to the man, a little balm, and honey, and storax, myrrh, turpentine, and almonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.12'>And take with you double money, and carry back what you found in your sacks, lest perhaps it was done by mistake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.13'>And take also your brother, and go to the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.14'>And may my almighty Bod make him favourable to you; and send back with you your brother, whom he keepeth, and this Benjamin: and as for me I shall be desolate without children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.15'>So the men took the presents, and double money, and Benjamin: and went down into Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.16'>And when he had seen them, and Benjamin with them, he commanded the steward of his house, saying: Bring in the men into the house, and kill victims, and prepare a feast: because they shall eat with me at noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.17'>He did as he was commanded, and brought the men into the house.\</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.18'>And they being much afraid, said there one to another: Because of the money, which we carried back the first time in our sacks, we are brought in: that he may bring upon us a false accusation, and by violence make slaves of us and our asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.19'>Wherefore going up to the steward of the house, at the door,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.20'>They said: Sir, we desire thee to hear us: We came down once before to buy food:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.21'>And when we had bought, and come to the inn, we opened our sacks, and found our money in the mouths of the sacks: which we have now brought again in the same weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.22'>And we have brought other money besides, to buy what we want: we cannot tell who put it in our bags.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.23'>But he answered: Peace be with you, fear not: your God, and the God of your Father hath given you treasure in your sacks. For the money, which you gave me, I have for good. And he brought Simeon out to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.24'>And having brought them into the house, he fetched water, and they washed their feet, and he gave provender to their asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.25'>But they made ready the presents, against Joseph came at noon: for they had heard that they should eat bread there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.26'>Then Joseph came into his house, and they offered him the presents holding them in their hands, and they bowed down with their face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.27'>But he, courteously saluting them again, asked them, saying: Is the old man your father in health, of whom uou told me? Is he yet living?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.28'>And they answered: Thy servant our father is in health, he is yet living. And bowing themselves they made obeisance to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.29'>And Joseph lifting up his eyes, saw Benjamin his brother, by the same mother, and said: Is this your young brother, of whom you told me? And he said: God be gracious to thee, my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.30'>And he made haste becouse his heart was moved upon his brother, and tears gushed out: And going into his chamber he wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.31'>And when he had washed his face, coming out again, he refrained himself, and said: Set bread on the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.32'>And when it was set on, for Joseph apart, and for his brethren apart, for the Egyptians also that ate with him, apart, (for it is unlawful for the Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews, and they think such a feast profane:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.33'>They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his age. And they wondered very much:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.34'>Taking the messes which they received of him: and the greater mess came to Benjamin, so that it exceeded by five parts. And they drank, and were merry with him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.44.1'>And Joseph commanded the steward of his house, saying: Fill their sacks with corn, as much as they can hold: and put the money of every one in the top of his sack.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.2'>And in the mouth of the younger's sack put my silver cup, and the price which he gave for the wheat. And it was so done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.3'>And when the morning arose, they were sent away with their asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.4'>And when they were now departed out of the city, and had gone forward a little way; Joseph sendingfor the steward of his house, said: Arise, and pursue after the men: and when thou hast overtaken them, say to them: Why have you returned evil for good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.5'>The cup which you have stolen is that in which my lord drinketh, and in which he is wont to divine: you have done a very evil thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.6'>He did as he had commanded him. And having overtaken them, he spoke to them the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.7'>And they answered: Why doth our lord speak so, as though thy servants had committed so heinous a fact?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.8'>The money, that we found in the top of our sacks, we brought back to thee from the land of Chanaan: how then should it be that we should steal out of thy lord's house, gold or silver?\</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.9'>With whomsoever of thy servants shall be found that which thou seekest, let him die, and we will be the bondmen of my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.10'>And he said to them: Let it be according to your sentence: with whomsoever it shall be found, let him be my servant, and you shall be blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.11'>Them they speedily took down their sacks to the ground, and every man opened his sack.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.12'>Which when he had searched, beginning at the eldest and ending at the youngest, he found the cup in Benjamin's sack.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.13'>Then they rent their garments, and loading their asses again, returned into the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.14'>And Juda at the head of his brethren went in to Joseph, (for he was not yet gone out of the place, ) and they altogether fell down before him on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.15'>And he said to them: Why would you do so? know you not that there is no one like me in the science of divining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.16'>And Juda said to him: What shall we answer my lord? or what shall we say, or be able justly to allege? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are all bondmen to my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup was found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.17'>Joseph answered: God forbid that should do so: he that stole the cup, he shall be my bondman: and go you away free to your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.18'>Then Juda coming hearer, said boldly: I beseech thee, my lord, let thy servant speak a word in thy ears,and be not angry with thy servant: for after Pharao thou art,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.19'>My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the first time: Have you a father or a brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.20'>And we answered thee, my lord: We have a father an old man, and a young boy, that was born in his old age; whose brother by the mother is dead: and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him tenderly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.21'>And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him hither to me, and I will set my eyes on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.22'>We suggested to my lord: The boy cannot leave his father: for if he leave him, he will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.23'>And thou saidst to thy servants: Except your youngest brother come with you, you shall see my face no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.24'>Therefore when we were gone up to thy servant our father, we told him all that my lord had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.25'>And our father said: Go again, and buy us a little wheat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.26'>And we said to him: We cannot go: if our youngest brother go down with us, we will set out together: otherwise, without him we dare not see the man's face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.27'>Whereunto he answered: You know that my wife bore two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.28'>One went out, and you said: A beast devoured him: and hitherto he appeareth not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.29'>If you take this also, and any thing befall him in the way you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow unto hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.30'>Therefore if I shall go to thy servant our father, and the boy be wanting, (whereas his life dependeth upon the life of him,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.31'>And he shall see that he is not with us, he will die, and thy servants shall bring down his gray hairs with sorrow unto hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.32'>Let me be tht proper servant, who took him into my trust, and promised, saying: If I bring him not again, I will be guilty of sin against my father for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.33'>Therefore I thy servant will stay instead of the boy in the service of my lord, and let the boy go up with his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.34'>For I cannot return to my father without the boy, lest I be a witness of the calamity that will oppress my father.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.45'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.1'>Joseph could no longer refrain himself before many that stood by: whereupon he commanded that all should go out, and no stranger be present at their knowing one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.2'>And he lifted up his voice with weeping, which the Egyptians and all the house of Pharao heard. \</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.3'>And he said to his brethren: I am Joseph: is my father yet living? His brethren could no answer him, being struck with exceeding great fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.4'>And he said mildly to them: Come nearer to me. And when they were come near him, he said: I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.5'>Be not afraid, and let it not seem to you a hard case that you sold me into these countries: for God sent me before you into Egypt for your preservation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.6'>For it is two years since the famine began to be upon the land, and five years more remain, wherein there can be neither ploughing nor reaping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.7'>And God sent me before, that you may be preserved upon the earth, and may have food to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.8'>Not by your counsel was I sent hither, but by the will of God: who hath made me as it were a father to Pharao, and lord of his whold house, and governor in all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.9'>Make haste, and go ye up to my father, and say to him: Thus saith thy son Joseph: God hath made me lord of the whole land of Egypt: come down to me, linger not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.10'>And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gessen: and thou shalt be near me, thou and thy sons, and thy son's sons, thy sheep, and thy gerds, and all things that thou hast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.11'>And there I will feed thee, (for there are yet five years of famine remaining,) lest both thou perish, and thy house, and all things that thou hast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.12'>Behold, your eyes, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my mouth that speaketh to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.13'>You shall tell my father of all my glory, and all things that you have seen in Egypt: make haste and bring him to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.14'>And falling upon the neck of his brother Benjamin, he embraced him and wept: and Benjamin in like manner wept also on his neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.15'>And Joseph kissed all his brethren, and wept upon every one of them: after which they were emboldened to ,peak to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.16'>And it was heard, and the fame was abroad in the king's court: The brethren of Joseph are come: and Pharao with all his family was glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.17'>And he spoke to Joseph that he should give orders to his brethren, saying : Load your beasts, and go into the land of Chanaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.18'>And bring away from thence your father and kindred, and come to me: and I will give you all the good things of Egypt, that you may eat the marrow of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.19'>Give orders also that they take wagons out of the land of Egypt, for/ the carriage of their children and their wives: and say: Take up your father, and make haste to come with all speed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.20'>And leave nothing of your house- hold stuff: for all the riches of Egypt shall be yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.21'>And the sons of Israel did as they were bid. And Joseph gave them wagons according to Pharao's commandment: and provisions for the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.22'>He ordered also to be brought out for every one of them two robes: but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver with Ave robes of the best:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.23'>Sending to his father as much money and raiment, adding besides ten he asses to carry off all the riches of Egypt, and as many she asses, carrying wheat and bread for the journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.24'>So he sent away his brethren, and at their departing said to them: Be not angry in the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.25'>And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Chanaan to their father Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.26'>And they told him, saying: Joseph thy son is living: and he is ruler in all the land of Egypt. Which when Jacob heard, he awaked as it were out of a deep sleep, yet did not believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.27'>They, on the other side, told the whole order of the thing. And when he saw the wagons and all that he had sent his spirit revived,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.45.28'>And he said: It is enough for me, if Joseph my son be yet living: Iwill go and see him before I die.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.46'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.1'>And Israel taking his journey, with all that he had, came to the well of the oath, and killing victims there to the God of his father Isaac,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.2'>He heard him by a vision in the night calling him, and saying to him: Jacob, Jacob. And he answered him: Lo, here I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.3'>God said to him: I am the most mighty God of thy father: fear not, go down into Egypt, for I will make a great nation of thee there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.4'>I will go down with thee thither, and will bring thee back again from thence: Joseph also shall put his hands upon thy eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.5'>And Jacob rose up from the well of the oath: and his sons took him up, with their children and wives in the wagons, which Pharao had sent to carry the old man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.6'>And all that he had in the land of Chanaan, and he came into Egypt with all his seed:"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.46.33'>And when he shall call you, and shall say: What is your occupation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.34'>You shall answer: We thy servants are shepherds, from our infancy until now, both we and our fathers. And this you shall say, that you may dwell in the land of Gessen, because the Egyptians have all shepherds in abomination.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.47'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.1'>Then Joseph went in and told Pharao, saying: My father and brethren, their sheep and their herds, and all that they possess, are come out of the land of Chanaan: and behold they stay in the land of Gessen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.2'>Five men also the last of his brethren, he presented before the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.3'>And he asked them: What is your occupation? They answered: Re thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.4'>We are come to sojourn in thy land, because there is no grass for the flocks of thy servants, the famine being very grievous in the land of Chanaan: and we pray thee to give orders that we thy servants may be in the land of Gessen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.5'>The king therefore said to Joseph: Thy father and thy brethren are come to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.6'>The land of Egypt is before thee: make them dwell in the best place, and give them the land of Gessen. And if thou knowest that there are industrious men among them, make them rulers over my cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.7'>After this Joseph brought in his to the king, and presented him before him: and he blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.8'>And being asked by him: How many are the days of the years of thy life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.9'>He answered: The days of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years, few, and evil, and they are not come up to the days of the pilgrimage of my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.10'>And blessing the king, he went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.11'>But Joseph gave a possession to his father and his brethren in Egypt, in the best place of the land, in Ramesses, as Pharao had commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.12'>And he nourished them, and all his father's house, allowing food to every one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.13'>For in the whole world there was want of bread, and a famine had op- pressed the land: more especially of Egypt and Chanaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.14'>Out of which he gathered up all the money for the corn which they bought, and brought it into the king's treasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.15'>And when the buyers wanted money, all Egypt came to Joseph, saying: Give us bread: why should we die in thy presence, having now net money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.16'>And he answered them: Bring your cattle, and for them I will give you food, if you have no money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.17'>And when they had brought them, he gave them food in exchange for their horses, and sheep, and oxen, end asses and he maintained them that year for the exchange of their cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.18'>And they came the second year, and said to him: We will not hide from our lord, how that our money is spent, and our cattle also are gone: neither art thou ignorant that we have nothing now left but our bodies and our lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.19'>Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes? we will be thins, both we and our lands: buy us to be the king's servants, and give us seed, lest for want of tillers the land be turned into a wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.20'>So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt, every man selling his possessions, because of the greatness of the famine. And he brought it into Pharao's hands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.21'>And all its people from one end of the borders of Egypt, even to the other end thereof,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.22'>Except the land of the priests, which had been given them by the king: to whom also a certain allowance of food was given out of the public stores, and therefore they were not forced to sell their possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.23'>Then Joseph said to the people : Be- hold as you see, both you and your lands belong to Pharao: take seed and sow the fields,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.24'>That you may have corn. The fifth part you shall give to the king: the other four you shall have for seed, and for food for your families and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.25'>And they answered: Our life is in thy hand: only let my lord look favourably upon us, and we will gladly serve the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.26'>From that time unto this day, in the whole land of Egypt, the fifth part is paid to the king, and it is become as a law, except the land of the priests, which was free from this covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.27'>So Israel dwelt in Egypt, that is, in the land of Gessen, and possessed it: and grew, and was multiplied exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.28'>And he lived in it seventeen years: and all the days of his life came to a hundred and forty-seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.29'>And when he saw that the day of his death drew nigh, he called his son Joseph, and said to him: If I have found favour in thy sight, put thy hand under my thigh; and thou shalt shew me this kindness and truth, not to bury me in Egypt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.30'>But I will sleep with my fathers, end thou shalt take me away out of this land, and bury me in the burying place of my ancestors. And Joseph answered him: I will do what thou hast commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.31'>And he said: Swear then to me. And as he was swearing, Israel adored God, turning to the bed's head.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.48'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.1'>After these things, it was told Joseph that his father was sick: and he set out to go to him, taking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.2'>And it was told the old man: Behold I thy son Joseph cometh to thee. And being strengthened he sat on his bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.3'>And when Joseph was come in to him, he said : God Almighty appeared to me at Lute, which is in the land of Chanaan: and he blessed me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.4'>And he said : I will cause thee to increase and multiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of people: and I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.5'>So thy two sons who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came hither to thee, shall be mine: Ephraim and Manasses shall be reputed to me as Ruben and Simeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.6'>But the rest whom thou shalt have after them, shall be thine, and shall be called by the name of their brethren in their possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.7'>For, when I came out of Mesopotamia, Rachel died from me in the land of Ohanaan in the very journey, and it was springtime: and I was going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the way of Ephrata, which by another name is called Bethlehem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.8'>Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who are these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.9'>He answered: They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said: Bring them to me that I may bless them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.10'>For Israel's eyes were dim by reason of his great age, and he could not see clearly. And when they were brought to him, he kissed and embraced them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.11'>And said to his son: I am not deprived of seeing thee: moreover God hath shewed me thy seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.12'>And when Joseph had taken them from his father's lap, he bowed down with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.13'>And he set Ephraim on his right bend, that is, towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses on his left hand, to wit, towards his father's right hand, and brought them near to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.14'>But he stretching forth his right hand, put it upon the head of Ephraim the younger brother; and the left upon the head of Manasses who was the elder, changing his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.15'>And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and said: God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, God that feedeth me from my youth until this day;</verse>
