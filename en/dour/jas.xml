      <chapter osisID='Jas.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.1'>James the servant of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.2'>My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.3'>Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.4'>And patience hath a perfect work; that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.5'>But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men abundantly, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.6'>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.7'>Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.8'>A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.9'>But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.10'>And the rich, in his being low; because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.11'>For the sun rose with a burning heat, and parched the grass, and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.12'>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive a crown of life, which God hath promised to them that love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.13'>Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils, and he tempteth no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.14'>But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.15'>Then when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.16'>Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.17'>Every best gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor shadow of alteration.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.18'>For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some beginning of his creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.19'>You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.20'>For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.21'>Wherefore casting away all uncleanness, and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.22'>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.23'>For if a man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.24'>For he beheld himself, and went his way, and presently forgot what manner of man he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.25'>But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty, and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; this man shall be blessed in his deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.26'>And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.27'>Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation: and to keep one's self unspotted from this world.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.1'>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.2'>For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring, in fine apparel, and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.3'>And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel, and shall say to him: Sit thou here well; but say to the poor man: Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.4'>Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust thoughts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'>Hearken, my dearest brethren: hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.6'>But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by might? and do not they draw you before the judgment seats?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.7'>Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.8'>If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.9'>But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the law as transgressors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.10'>And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.11'>For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.12'>So speak ye, and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.13'>For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy exalteth itself above judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.14'>What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.15'>And if a brother or sister be naked, and want daily food:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.16'>And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.17'>So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.18'>But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.19'>Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.20'>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.21'>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.22'>Seest thou, that faith did co-operate with his works; and by works faith was made perfect?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.23'>And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.24'>Do you see that by works a man is justified; and not by faith only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.25'>And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers, and sending them out another way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.26'>For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also faith without works is dead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.1'>Be ye not many masters, my brethren, knowing that you receive the greater judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.2'>For in many things we all offend. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man. He is able also with a bridle to lead about the whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.3'>For if we put bits into the mouths of horses, that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.4'>Behold also ships, whereas they are great, and are driven by strong winds, yet are they turned about with a small helm, whithersoever the force of the governor willeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.5'>Even so the tongue is indeed a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold how small a fire kindleth a great wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.6'>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is placed among our members, which defileth the whole body, and inflameth the wheel of our nativity, being set on fire by hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.7'>For every nature of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of the rest, is tamed, and hath been tamed, by the nature of man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.8'>But the tongue no man can tame, an unquiet evil, full of deadly poison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.9'>By it we bless God and the Father: and by it we curse men, who are made after the likeness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.10'>Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.11'>Doth a fountain send forth, out of the same hole, sweet and bitter water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.12'>Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear grapes; or the vine, figs? So neither can the salt water yield sweet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.13'>Who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge among you? Let him shew, by a good conversation, his work in the meekness of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.14'>But if you have bitter zeal, and there be contentions in your hearts; glory not, and be not liars against the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.15'>For this is not wisdom, descending from above: but earthly, sensual, devilish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.16'>For where envying and contention is, there is inconstancy, and every evil work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.17'>But the wisdom, that is from above, first indeed is chaste, then peaceable, modest, easy to be persuaded, consenting to the good, full of mercy and good fruits, without judging, without dissimulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.18'>And the fruit of justice is sown in peace, to them that make peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.1'>From whence are wars and contentions among you? Are they not hence, from your concupiscences, which war in your members?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.2'>You covet, and have not: you kill, and envy, and can not obtain. You contend and war, and you have not, because you ask not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.3'>You ask, and receive not; because you ask amiss: that you may consume it on your concupiscences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.4'>Adulterers, know you not that the friendship of this world is the enemy of God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of this world, becometh an enemy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.5'>Or do you think that the scripture saith in vain: To envy doth the spirit covet which dwelleth in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.6'>But he giveth greater grace. Wherefore he saith: God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.7'>Be subject therefore to God, but resist the devil, and he will fly from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.8'>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners: and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.9'>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.10'>Be humbled in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.11'>Detract not one another, my brethren. He that detracteth his brother, or he that judgeth his brother, detracteth the law, and judgeth the law. But if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.12'>There is one lawgiver, and judge, that is able to destroy and to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.13'>But who art thou that judgest thy neighbour? Behold, now you that say: To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and there we will spend a year, and will traffic, and make our gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.14'>Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.15'>For what is your life? It is a vapour which appeareth for a little while, and afterwards shall vanish away. For that you should say: If the Lord will, and if we shall live, we will do this or that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.16'>But now you rejoice in your arrogancies. All such rejoicing is wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.17'>To him therefore who knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.1'>Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl in your miseries, which shall come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.2'>Your riches are corrupted: and your garments are motheaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.3'>Your gold and silver is cankered: and the rust of them shall be for a testimony against you, and shall eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up to yourselves wrath against the last days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.4'>Behold the hire of the labourers, who have reaped down your fields, which by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth: and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.5'>You have feasted upon earth: and in riotousness you have nourished your hearts, in the day of slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.6'>You have condemned and put to death the Just One, and he resisted you not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.7'>Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth: patiently bearing till he receive the early and latter rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.8'>Be you therefore also patient, and strengthen your hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.9'>Grudge not, brethren, one against another, that you may not be judged. Behold the judge standeth before the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.10'>Take, my brethren, for an example of suffering evil, of labour and patience, the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.11'>Behold, we account them blessed who have endured. You have heard of the patience of Job, and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is merciful and compassionate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.12'>But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath. But let your speech be, yea, yea: no, no: that you fall not under judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.13'>Is any of you sad? Let him pray. Is he cheerful in mind? Let him sing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.14'>Is any man sick among you? Let him bring in the priests of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.15'>And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man: and the Lord shall raise him up: and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.16'>Confess therefore your sins one to another: and pray one for another, that you may be saved. For the continual prayer of a just man availeth much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.17'>Elias was a man passible like unto us: and with prayer he prayed that it might not rain upon the earth, and it rained not for three years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.18'>And he prayed again: and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.19'>My brethren, if any of you err from the truth, and one convert him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.20'>He must know that he who causeth a sinner to be converted from the error of his way, shall save his soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.</verse>
