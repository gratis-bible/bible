  <div type='book' osisID='Deut'>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.1'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.1'>These are the words, which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan, in the plain wilderness, over against the Red Sea, between Pharan and Thophel and Laban and Haseroth, where there is very much gold:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>Eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Cadesbarne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>In the fortieth year, the eleventh month, the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel all that the Lord had commanded him to say to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.4'>After that he had slain Sehon king of the Amorrhites, who dwelt in Hesebon: and Og king of Basan who abode in Astaroth, and in Edrai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>l And you answered me: We have sinned against the Lord: we will go up and fight, as the Lord our God hath commanded. And when you went ready armed unto the mountain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>Beyond the Jordan in the land of Moab. And Moses began to expound the law, and to say:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: You have stayed long enough in this mountain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>Turn you, and come to the mountain of the Amorrhites, and to the other places that are next to it, the plains and the hills and the vales towards the south, and by the sea shore, the land of the Chanaanites, and of Libanus, as far as the great river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>Behold, said he, I have delivered it to you: go in and possess it, concerning which the Lord swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he would give it to them, and to their seed after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>And I said to you at that time:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>I alone am not able to bear you: for the Lord your God hath multiplied you, and you are this day as the stars of heaven, for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.13'>(The Lord God of your fathers add to this number many thousands, and bless you as he hath spoken.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.14'>I alone am not able to bear your business, and the charge of you and your differences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.15'>Let me have from among you wise and understanding men, and such whose conversation is approved among your tribes, that I may appoint them your rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.16'>Then you answered me: The thing is good which thou meanest to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.17'>And I took out of your tribes men wise and honourable, and appointed them rulers, tribunes, and centurions, and officers over fifties, and over tens, who might teach you all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.18'>And I commanded them, saying: Hear them, and judge that which is just: whether he be one of your country, or a stranger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.19'>There shall be no difference of persons, you shall hear the little as well as the great: neither shall you respect any man's person, because it is the judgment of God. And if any thing seem hard to you, refer it to me, and I will hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.20'>And I commanded you all things that you were to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.21'>And departing from Horeb, we passed through the terrible and vast wilderness, which you saw, by the way of the mountain of the Amorrhite, as the Lord our God had commanded us. And when we were come into Cadesbarne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.22'>I said to you: You are come to the mountain of the Amorrhite, which the Lord our God will give to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.23'>See the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee: go up and possess it, as the Lord our God hath spoken to thy fathers: fear not, nor be any way discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.24'>And you came all to me, and said: Let us send men who may view the land, and bring us word what way we shall go up, and to what cities we shall go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.25'>And because the saying pleased me, I sent of you twelve men, one of every tribe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.26'>Who, when they had set forward and had gone up to the mountains, came as far as the valley of the cluster: and having viewed the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.27'>Taking of the fruits thereof, to shew its fertility, they brought them to us, and said: The land is good, which the Lord our God will give us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.28'>And you would not go up, but being incredulous to the word of the Lord our God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.29'>You murmured in your tents, and said: The Lord hateth us, and therefore he hath brought us out of the land of Egypt, that he might deliver us into the hand of the Amorrhite, and destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.30'>Whither shall we go up? the messengers have terrified our hearts, saying: The multitude is very great, and taller than we: the cities are great, and walled up td the sky, we have seen the sons of the Enacims there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.31'>And I said to you: Fear not, neither be ye afraid of them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.32'>The Lord God, who is your leader, himself will fight for you, as he did in Egypt in the sight of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.33'>And in the wilderness (as thou hast seen) the Lord thy God hath carried thee, as a man is wont to carry his little son, all the way that you have come, until you came to this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.34'>And yet for all this you did not believe the Lord your God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.35'>Who went before you in the way, and marked out the place, wherein you should pitch your tents, in the night shewing you the way by fire, and in the day by the pillar of a cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.36'>And when the Lord had heard the voice of your words, he was angry and swore, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.37'>Not one of the men of this wicked generation shall see the good land, which I promised with an oath to your fathers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.38'>Except Caleb the son of Jephone: for he shall see it, and to him I will give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath followed the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.39'>Neither is his indignation against the people to be wondered at, since the Lord was angry with me also on your account, and said: Neither shalt thou go in thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.40'>But Josue the son of Nun, thy minister, he shall go in for thee: exhort and encourage him, and he shall divide the land by lot to Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.41'>Your children, of whom you said that they should be led away captives, and your sons who know not this day the difference of good and evil, they shall go in: and to them I will give the land, and they shall possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.42'>But return you and go into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.43'>dummy verses inserted by amos</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.44'>The Lord said to me: Say to them: Go not up, and fight not, for I am not with you: lest you fall before your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.45'>I spoke, and you hearkened not: but resisting the commandment of the Lord, and swelling with pride, you went up into the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.46'>And the Amorrhite that dwelt in the mountains coming out, and meeting you, chased you, as bees do: and made slaughter of you from Seir as far as Horma.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.47'>And when you returned and wept before the Lord, he heard you not, neither would he yield to ;your voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.48'>So you abode in Cadesbarne a long time.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.2'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.1'>And departing from thence we came into the wilderness that leadeth to the Red Sea, as the Lord had spoken to me: and we compassed mount Seir a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.2'>And the Lord said to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.3'>You have compassed this mountain long enough: go toward the north:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.4'>And command thou the people, saying: You shall pass by the borders of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, and they will be afraid of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.5'>Take ye then good heed that you stir not against them. For I will not give you of their land so much as the step of one foot can tread upon, because I have given mount Seir to Esau, for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.6'>You shall buy meats of them for money and shall eat: you shall draw waters for money, and shall drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.7'>The Lord thy God hath blessed thee in every work of thy hands: the Lord thy God dwelling with thee, knoweth thy journey, how thou hast passed through this great wilderness, for forty years, and thou hast wanted nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.8'>And when we had passed by our brethren the children of Esau, that dwelt in Seir, by the way of the plain from Elath and from Asiongaber, we came to the way that leadeth to the desert of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.9'>And the Lord said to me: Fight not against the Moabites, neither go to battle against them: for I will not give thee any of their land, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot in possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.10'>The Emims first were the inhabitants thereof, a people great, and strong, and so tall, that like the race of the Enacims,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.11'>They were esteemed as giants, and were like the sons of the Enacims. But the Moabites call them Emims.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.12'>The Horrhites also formerly dwelt in Seir: who being driven out and destroyed, the children of Esau dwelt there, as Israel did in the land of his possession, which the Lord gave him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.13'>Then rising up to pass the torrent Zared, we came to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.14'>And the time that we journeyed from Cadesbarne till we passed over the torrent Zared, was thirty-eight years: until all the generation of the men that were fit for war was consumed out of the camp, as the Lord had sworn:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.15'>For his hand was against them, that they should perish from the midst of the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.16'>And after all the fighting men were dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.17'>The Lord spoke to me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.18'>Thou shalt pass this day the borders of Moab, the city named Ar:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.19'>And when thou comest nigh the frontiers of the children of Ammon, take heed thou fight not against them, nor once move to battle: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.20'>It was accounted a land of giants: and giants formerly dwelt in it, whom the Ammonites call Zomzommims,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.21'>A people great and many, and of tall stature, like the Enacims whom the Lord destroyed before their face: and he made them to dwell in their stead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.22'>As he had done in favour of the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, destroying the Horrhites, and delivering their land to them, which they possess to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.23'>The Hevites also, that dwelt in Haserim as far as Gaza, were expelled by the Cappadocians: who came out of Cappadocia, and destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.24'>Arise ye, and pass the torrent Arnon: Behold I have delivered into thy hand Sehon king of Hesebon the Amorrhite, and begin thou to possess his land and make war against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.25'>This day will I begin to send the dread and fear of thee upon the nations that dwell under the whole heaven: that when they hear thy name they may fear and tremble, and be in pain like women in travail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.26'>So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Cademoth to Sehon the king of Hesebon with peaceable words, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.27'>We will pass through thy land, we will go along by the highway: we will not turn aside neither to the right hand nor to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.28'>Sell us meat for money, that we may eat: give us water for money and so we will drink. We only ask that thou wilt let us pass through,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.29'>As the children of Esau have done, that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites, that abide in Ar: until we come to the Jordan, and pass to the land which the Lord our God will give us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.30'>And Sehon the king of Hesebon would not let us pass: because the Lord thy God had hardened his spirit, and fixed his heart, that he might be delivered into thy hands, as now thou seest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.31'>And the Lord said to me: Behold I have begun to deliver unto thee Sehon and his land, begin to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.32'>And Sehon came out to meet us with all his people to fight at Jasa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.33'>And the Lord our God delivered him to us: and we slew him with his sons and all his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.34'>And we took all his cities at that time, killing the inhabitants of them, men and women and children. We left nothing of them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.35'>Except the cattle which came to the share of them that took them: and the spoils of the cities, which we took:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.36'>From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Amen, a town that is situate in a valley, as far as Galaad. There was not a village or city, that escaped our hands: the Lord our God delivered all unto us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.37'>Except the land of the children of Ammon, to which we approached not: and all that border upon the torrent Jeboc, and the cities in the mountains, and all the places which the Lord our God forbade us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.3'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.1'>Then we turned and went by the way of Basan: and Og the king of Basan came out to meet us with his people to fight in Edrai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.2'>And the Lord said to me: Fear him not: because he is delivered into thy hand, with all his people and his land: and thou shalt do to him as thou hast done to Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that dwelt in Hesebon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.3'>So the Lord our God delivered into our hands, Og also the king of Basan, and all his people: and we utterly destroyed them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.4'>Wasting all his cities at one time, there was not a town that escaped us: sixty cities, all the country of Argob the kingdom of Og in Basan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.5'>All the cities were fenced with very high walls, and with gates and bars, be- sides innumerable towns that had no walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.6'>And we utterly destroyed them, as we had done to Sehon the king of Hesebon, destroying every city, men and women and children:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.7'>But the cattle and the spoils of the cities we took for our prey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.8'>And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan: from the torrent Amen unto the mount Hermon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.9'>Which the Sidonians call Sarion, and the Amorrhites Sanir:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.10'>All the cities that are situate in the plain, and all the land of Galaad and Basan as far as Selcha and Edrai, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.11'>For only Og king of Basan remained of the race of the giants. His bed of iron is shewn, which is in Rabbath of the children of Ammon, being nine cubits long, and four broad after the measure of the cubit of a man's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.12'>And we possessed the land at that time from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Amen, unto the half of mount Galaad: and I gave the cities thereof to Ruben and Gad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.13'>And I delivered the other part of Galaad, and all Basan the kingdom of Og to the half tribe of Manasses, all the country of Argob: and all Basan is called the Land of giants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.14'>Jair the son of Manasses possessed all the country of d Argob unto the borders of Gessuri, and Machati. And he called Basan by his own name, Havoth Jair, that is to say, the towns of Jair, until this present day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.15'>To Machir also I gave Galaad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.16'>And to the tribes of Ruben and Cad I gave of the land of Galaad as far as the torrent Amen, half the torrent, and the confines even unto the torrent Jeboc, which is the border of the children of Ammon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.17'>And the plain of the wilderness, and the Jordan, and the borders of Cenereth unto the sea of the desert, which is the most salt sea, to the foot of mount Phasga eastward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.18'>And I commanded you at that time, saying: The Lord your God giveth you this land for an inheritance, go ye well appointed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the strong men of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.19'>Leaving your wives and children and cattle. For I know you have much cattle, and they must remain in the cities, which I have delivered to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.20'>Until the Lord give rest to your brethren, as he hath given to you: and they also possess the land, which he will give them beyond the Jordan: then shall every man return to his possession, which I have given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.21'>I commanded Josue also at that time, saying: Thy eyes have seen what the Lord your God hath done to these two kings: so will he do to all the king- dome to which thou shalt pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.22'>Fear them not: for the Lord your God will fight for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.23'>And I besought the Lord at that time, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.24'>Lord God, thou hast begun to shew unto thy servant thy greatness, and most mighty hand, for there is no other God either in heaven or earth, that is able to do thy works, or to be compared to thy strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.25'>I will pass over therefore, and will see this excellent land beyond the Jordan, and this goodly mountain, and Libanus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.26'>And the Lord was angry with me on your account and heard me not, but said to me: It is enough: speak no more to me of this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.27'>Go up to the top of Phasga, and cast thy eyes round about to the west, and to the north, and to the south, and to the east, and behold it, for thou shalt not pass this Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.28'>Command Josue, and encourage and strengthen him: for he shall go before this people, and shall divide unto them the land which thou shalt see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.29'>And we abode in the valley over against the temple of Phogor.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.4'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.1'>And now, O Israel, hear the commandments and judgments which I teach thee: that doing them, thou mayst live, and entering in mayst possess the land which the Lord the God of your fathers will give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.2'>You shall not add to the word that I speak to you, neither shall you take away from it: keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.3'>Your eyes have seen all that the Lord hath done against Beelphegor, how he hath destroyed all his worshippers from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.4'>But you that adhere to the Lord your Cad, are all alive until this present day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.5'>You know that I have taught you statutes and justices, as the Lord my God hath commanded me: so shall you do them in the land which you shall possess:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.6'>And you shall observe, and fulfil them in practice. For this is your wisdom, and understanding in the sight of nations, that hearing all these precepts, they may say: Behold a wise and understanding people, a great nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.7'>Neither is there any other nation so great, that hath gods so nigh them, as our God is present to all our petitions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.8'>For what other nation is there so renowned that hath ceremonies, and just judgments, and all the law, which I will set forth this day before your eyes?</verse>
