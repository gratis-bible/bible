  <div type='book' osisID='2Sam'>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.1'>Now it came to pass, after Saul was dead, that David returned from the slaughter of the Amalecites, and abode two days in Siceleg.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.2'>And on the third day, there appeared a man who came out of Saul's camp, with his garments rent, and dust strewed on his head: and when he came to David, he fell upon his face, and adored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.3'>And David said to him: From whence comest thou? And he said to him: I am fled out of the camp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.4'>And David said unto him: What is the matter that is come to pass? tell me. He said: The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people are fallen and dead: moreover Saul and Jonathan his son are slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.5'>And David said to the young man that told him: How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son, are dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.6'>And the young man that told him, said: I came by chance upon mount Gelboe, and Saul leaned upon his spear: and the chariots and horsemen drew nigh unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.7'>And looking behind him, and seeing me, he called me. And I answered, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.8'>And he said to me: Who art thou? And I said to him: I am an Amalecite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.9'>And he said to me: Stand over me, and kill me: for anguish is come upon me, and as yet my whole life is in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.10'>So standing over him, I killed him: for I knew that he could not live after the fall: and I took the diadem that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them hither to thee, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.11'>Then David took hold of his garments and rent them, and likewise all the men that were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.12'>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel, because they were fallen by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.13'>And David said to the young man that told him: Whence art thou? He answered: I am the son of a stranger of Amalee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.14'>David said to him: Why didst thou not fear to put out thy hand to kill the Lord's anointed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.15'>And David calling one of his servants, said: Go near and fall upon him. And he struck him so that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.16'>And David said to him: Thy blood be upon thy own head: for thy own mouth hath spoken against thee, saying: I have slain the Lord's anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.17'>And David made this kind of lamentation over Saul, and over Jonathan his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.18'>(Also he commanded that they should teach the children of Juda the use of the bow, as it is written in the book of the just.) And he said: Consider, O Israel, for them that are dead, wounded on thy high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.19'>The illustrious of Israel are slain upon thy mountains: how are the valiant fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.20'>Tell it not in Geth, publish it not in the streets of Ascalon: lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.21'>Ye mountains of Gelboe, let neither dew, nor rain come upon you, neither be they fields of firstfruits: for there was cast away the shield of the valiant, the shield of Saul as though he had not been anointed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.22'>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the valiant, the arrow of Jonathan never turned back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.23'>Saul and Jonathan, lovely, and comely in their life, even in death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.24'>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you with scarlet in delights, who gave ornaments of gold for your attire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.25'>How are the valiant fallen in battle? Jonathan slain in the high places?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.26'>I grieve for thee, my brother Jonathan: exceeding beautiful, and amiable to me above the love of women. As the mother loveth her only son, so did I love thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.27'>How are the valiant fallen, and the weapons of war perished?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.1'>And after these things David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go up into one of the cities of Juda? And the Lord said to him: Go up. And David said: Whither shall I go up? And he answered him: Into Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.2'>So David went up, and his two wives, Achinoam the Jezrahelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.3'>And the men also that were with him, David brought up every man with his household: and they abode in the towns of Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.4'>And the men of Juda came, and anointed David there, to be king over the house of Juda. And it was told David, that the men of Jabes Galaad had buried Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.5'>David therefore sent messengers to the men of Jabes Galaad, and said to them: Blessed be you to the Lord, who have shewn this mercy to your master Saul, and have buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.6'>And now the Lord surely will render you mercy and truth, and I also will, requite you for this good turn, because you have done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.7'>Let your hands be strengthened, and be ye men of valour: for although your master Saul be dead, yet the house of Juda hath anointed me to be their king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.8'>But Abner the son of Ner, general of Saul's army, took Isboseth the son of Saul, and led him about through the camp?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.9'>And made him king over Galaad, and, over Gessuri, and over Jezrahel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.10'>Isboseth the son of Saul was forty years old when he began to reign over, Israel, and he reigned two years: and only the house of Juda followed David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.11'>And the number of the days that David abode, reigning in Hebron over the house of Juda, was seven years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.12'>And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Isboseth the son of Saul, went out from the camp to Gabaon</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.13'>And Joab the son of Sarvia, and the servants of David went out, and met them by the pool of Gabaon. And when they were come together, they sat down over against one another: the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.14'>And Abner said to Joab: Let the young men rise, and play before us. And Joab answered: Let them rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.15'>Then there arose and went over twelve in number of Benjamin, of the part of Isboseth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.16'>And every one catching his fellow, by the head, thrust his sword into the side of his adversary, and they fell down together: and the name of the place was called: The field of the valiant, in Gabaon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.17'>And there was a very fierce battle that day: and Abner was put to flight, with the men of Israel, by the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.18'>And there were the three sons of Sarvia there, Joab, and Abisai, and Asael: now Asael was a most swift runner, like one of the roes that abide in the woods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.19'>And Asael pursued after Abner, and turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.20'>And Abner looked behind him, and said: Art thou Asael? And he answered: I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.21'>And Abner said to him: Go to the right hand or to the left, and lay hold on one of the young men and take thee his spoils. But Asael would not leave off following him close.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.22'>And again Abner said to Asael: Go off, and do not follow me, lest I be obliged to stab thee to the ground, and I shall not be able to hold up my face to Joab thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.23'>But he refused to hearken to him, and would not turn aside: wherefore Abner struck him with his spear with a back stroke in the groin, and thrust him through, and he died upon the spot: and all that came to the place where Asael fell down and died stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.24'>Now while Joab and Abisai pursued after Abner, the sun went down: and they came as far as the hill of the aqueduct, that lieth over against the valley by the way of the wilderness in Gabaon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.25'>And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together to Abner: and being joined in one body, they stood on the top of a hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.26'>And Abner cried out to Joab, and said: Shall thy sword rage unto utter destruction? knowest thou not that it is dangerous to drive people to despair? how long dost thou defer to bid the people cease from pursuing after their brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.27'>And Joab said: As the Lord liveth, if thou hadst spoke sooner, even in the morning the people should have retired from pursuing after their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.28'>Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and all the army stood still, and did not pursue after Israel any farther, nor fight any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.29'>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plains: and they passed the Jordan, and having gone through all Beth-horon, came to the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.30'>And Joab returning, after he had left Abner, assembled all the people: and there were wanting of David's servants nineteen men, beside Asael.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.31'>But the servants of David had killed of Benjamin, and of the men that were with Abner, three hundred and sixty, who all died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.32'>And they took Asael, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father in Bethlehem, and Joab, and the men that were with him, marched all the night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.1'>Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: David prospering and growing always stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul decaying daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.2'>And sons were born to David in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon of Achinoam the Jezrahelitess:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.3'>And his second Cheleab of Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel: and the third Absalom the son of Maacha the daughter of Tholmai king of Gessur:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.4'>And the fourth Adonias, the son of Haggith: and the fifth Saphathia the son of Abital:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.5'>And the sixth Jethraam of Egla the wife of David: these were born to David in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.6'>Now while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner the son of Ner ruled the house of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.7'>And Saul had a concubine named Respha, the daughter of Aia. And Isboseth said to Abner:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.8'>Why didst thou go in to my father's concubine? And he was exceedingly angry for the words of Isboseth, and said: Am I a dog's head against Juda this day, who have shewn mercy to the house of Saul thy father, and to his brethren and friends, and have not delivered thee into the hands of David, and hast thou sought this day against me to charge me with a matter concerning a woman?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.9'>So do God to Abner, and more also, unless as the Lord hath sworn to David, so I do to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.10'>That the kingdom be translated from the house of Saul, and the throne of David be set up over Israel, and over Juda from Dan to Bersabee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.11'>And he could not answer him a word, because he feared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.12'>Abner therefore sent messengers to David for himself, saying: Whose is the land? and that they should say: Make a league with me, and my hand shall be with thee: and I will bring all Israel to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.13'>And he said: Very well: I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, saying: Thou shalt not see my face before thou bring Michol the daughter of Saul: and so thou shalt come, and see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.14'>And David sent messengers to Isboseth the son of Saul, saying: Restore my wife Michol, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.15'>And Isboseth sent, and took her from her husband Phaltiel, the son of Lais.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.16'>And her husband followed her, weeping as far as Bahurim: and Abner said to him: Go and return. And he returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.17'>Abner also spoke to the ancients of Israel, saying: Both yesterday and the day before you sought for David that he might reign over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.18'>Now then do it: because the Lord hath spoken to David, saying: By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hands of the Philistines, and of all their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.19'>And Abner spoke also to Benjamin. And he went to speak to David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to all Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.20'>And he came to David in Hebron with twenty men: and David made a feast for Abner, and his men that came with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.21'>And Abner said to David: I will rise, that I may gather all Israel unto thee my lord the king, and may enter into a league with thee, and that thou mayst reign over all as thy soul desireth. Now when David bad brought Abner on his way, and he was gone in peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.22'>Immediately David's servants and Joab came, after having slain the robbers, with an exceeding great booty: and Abner, was not with David in Hebron, for he had now sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.23'>And Joab and all the army that was with him, came afterwards: and it was told Joab, that Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.24'>And Joab went in to the king, and said: What hast thou done? Behold Abner came to thee: Why didst thou send him away, and he is gone and departed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.25'>Knowest thou not Abner the son of Ner, that to this end he came to thee, that he might deceive thee, and to know thy going out, and thy coming in, and to know all thou dost?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.26'>Then Joab going out from David, sent messengers after Abner, and brought him back from the cistern of Sira, David knowing nothing of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.27'>And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate, to speak to him treacherously: and he stabbed him there in the groin, and he died, in revenge of the blood of Asael his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.28'>And when David heard of it, after the thing was now done, he said: I, and my kingdom are innocent before the Lord for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.29'>And may it come upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father's house: and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue of seed, or that is a leper, or that holdeth the distaff, or that falleth by the sword, or that wanteth bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.30'>So Joab and Abisai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asael at Gabaon in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.31'>And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him: Rend your garments, and gird yourselves with sackcloths, and mourn before the funeral of Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.32'>And when they had buried Abner in Hebron, king David lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner: and all the people also wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.33'>And the king mourning and lamenting over Abner, said: Not as cowards are wont to die, hath Abner died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.34'>Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet laden with fetters: but as men fall before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall. And all the people repeating it wept over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.35'>And when all the people came to take meat with David, while it was yet broad day, David swore, saying: So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread or any thing else before sunset.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.36'>And all the people heard, and they were pleased, and all that the king did seemed good in the sight of all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.37'>And all the people, and all Israel understood that day that it was not the king's doing, that Abner the son of Ner was slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.38'>The king also said to his servants: Do you not know that a prince and great man is slain this day in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.39'>But I as yet am tender, though anointed king. And these men the sons of Sarvia are too hard for me: the Lord reward him that doth evil according to his wickedness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.1'>And Isboseth the son of Saul heard that Abner was slain in Hebron: and his hands were weakened, and all Israel was troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.2'>Now the son of Saul had two men captains of his bands, the name of the one was Baana, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Remmon a Berothite of the children of Benjamin: for Beroth also was reckoned in Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.3'>And the Berothites fled into Gethaim, and were sojourners there until that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.4'>And Jonathan the son of Saul bad a son that was lame of his feet: for he was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan from Jezrahel. And his nurse took him up and fled: and as she made haste to flee, he fell and became lame: and his name was Miphiboseth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.5'>And the sons of Remmon the Berothite, Rechab and Baana coming, went into the house of Isboseth in the heat of the day: and he was sleeping upon his bed at noon. And the doorkeeper of the house, who was cleansing wheat, was fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.6'>And they entered into the house secretly taking ears of corn, and Rechab and Baana his brother stabbed him in the groin, and fled away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.7'>For when they came into the house, be was sleeping upon his bed in a parlour, and they struck him and killed him: and taking away his head they went off by the way of the wilderness, walking all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.8'>And they brought the head of Isboseth to David to Hebron: and they said to the king: Behold the head of Isboseth the son of Saul thy enemy who sought thy life: and the Lord hath revenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.9'>But David answered Rechab, and Baana his brother, the sons of Remmon the Berothite, and said to them: As the Lord liveth, who hath delivered my soul out of all distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.10'>The man that told me, and said: Saul is dead, who thought he brought good tidings, I apprehended, and slew him in Siceleg, who should have been rewarded for his news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.11'>How much more now when wicked men have slain an innocent man in his own house, upon his bed, shall I not require his blood at your hand, and take you away from the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.12'>And David commanded his servants and they slew them: and cutting off their hands and feet, hanged them up over the pool in Hebron: but the head of Isboseth they took and buried in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.1'>Then all the tribes of Israel came to David in Hebron, saying: Behold we are thy bone and thy flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.3'>Moreover yesterday also and the day before, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that did lead out and bring in Israel: and the Lord said to thee: Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.4'>The ancients also of Israel came to the king to Hebron, and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord: and they anointed David to be king over Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.10'>And it was told David by some that said: Urias went not to his house. And David said to Urias: Didst thou not come from thy journey? why didst thou not go down to thy house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.11'>And Urias said to David: The ark of God and Israel and Juda dwell in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord abide upon the face of the earth: and shall I go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to sleep with my wife? By thy welfare and by the welfare of thy soul I will not do this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.12'>Then David said to Urias: Tarry here to day, and to morrow I will send thee away. Urias tarried in Jerusalem that day and the next.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.13'>And David called him to eat and to drink before him, and he made him drunk: and he went out in the evening, and slept on his couch with the servants of his lord, and went not down into his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.14'>And when the morning was come, David wrote a letter to Joab: and sent it by the hand of Urias,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.15'>Writing in the letter: Set ye Urias in the front of the battle, where the fight is strongest: and leave ye him, that he may be wounded and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.16'>Wherefore as Joab was besieging the city, he put Urias in the place where he knew the bravest men were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.17'>And the men coming out of the city, fought against Joab, and there fell some of the people of the servants of David, and Urias the Hethite was killed also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.18'>Then Joab sent, and told David all things concerning the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.19'>And he charged the messenger, saying: When thou hast told all the words of the battle to the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.20'>If thou see him to be angry, and he shall say: Why did you approach so near to the wall to fight? knew you not that many darts are thrown from above off the wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.21'>Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerobaal? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, and slew him in Thebes? Why did you go near the wall? Thou shalt say: Thy servant Urias the Hethite is also slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.22'>So the messenger departed, and came and told David all that Joab had commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.23'>And the messenger said to David: The men prevailed against us, and they came out to us into the field: and we vigorously charged and pursued them even to the gate of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.24'>And the archers shot their arrows at thy servants from off the wall above: and some of the king's servants are slain, and thy servant Urias the Hethite is also dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.25'>And David said to the messenger: Thus shalt thou say to Joab: Let not this thing discourage thee: for various is the event of war: and sometimes one, sometimes another is consumed by the sword: encourage thy warriors against The city, and exhort them that thou mayest overthrow it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.26'>And the wife of Urias heard that Urias her husband was dead, and she mourned for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.27'>And the mourning being over, David sent and brought her into his house, and she became his wife, and she bore him a son: and this thing which David had done, was displeasing to the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.1'>And it came to pass after this, that Amnon the son of David loved the sister of Absalom the son of David, who was very beautiful, and her name was Thamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.2'>And he was exceedingly fond of her, so that he fell sick for the love of her: for as she was a virgin, he thought it hard to do any thing dishonestly with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.3'>Now Amnon had a friend, named Jonadab the son of Semmaa the brother of David, a very wise man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.4'>And he said to him: Why dost thou grow so lean from day to day, O son of the king? why dost thou not tell me the reason of it? And Amnon said to him: I am in love with Thamar the sister of my brother Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.5'>And Jonadab said to him: Lie down upon thy bed, and feign thyself sick: and when thy father shall come to visit thee, say to him: Let my sister Thamar, I pray thee, come to me, to give me to eat, and to make me a mess, that I may eat it at her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.6'>So Amnon lay down, and made as if he were sick: and when the king came to visit him, Amnon said to the king: I pray thee let my sister Thamar come, and make in my sight two little messes, that I may eat at her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.7'>Then David sent home to Thamar, saying: Come to the house of thy brother Amnon, and make him a mess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.8'>And Thamar came to the house of Amnon her brother: but he was laid down: and she took meal and tempered it: and dissolving it in his sight she made little messes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.9'>And taking what she had boiled, she poured it out, and set it before him, but he would not eat: and Amnon said: Put out all persons from me. And when they had put all persons out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.10'>Amnon said to Thamar: Bring the mess into the chamber, that I may eat at thy hand. And Thamar took the little messes which she had made, and brought them in to her brother Amnon in the chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.11'>And when she had presented him the meat, he took hold of her, and said: Come lie with me, my sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.12'>She answered him: Do not so, my brother, do not force me: for no such thing must be done in Israel. Do not thou this folly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.13'>For I shall not be able to bear my shame, and thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel: but rather speak to the king, and he will not deny me to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.14'>But he would not hearken to her prayers, but being stronger overpowered her and lay with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.15'>Then Amnon hated her with an exceeding great hatred: so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her before, And Amnon said to her: Arise, and get thee gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.16'>She answered him: This evil which now thou dost against me, in driving me away, is greater than that which thou didst before. And he would not hearken to her:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.17'>But calling the servants that ministered to him, he said: Thrust this woman out from me: and shut the door after her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.18'>And she was clothed with along robe: for the king's daughters that were virgins, used such kind of garments. Then his servant thrust her out: and shut the door after her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.19'>And she put ashes on her head, and rent her long robe and laid her hands upon her head, and went on crying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.20'>And Absalom her brother said to her: Hath thy brother Amnon lain with thee? but now, sister, hold thy peace, he is thy brother: and afflict not thy heart for this thing. So Thamar remained pining away in the house of Absalom her brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.21'>And when king David heard of these things he was exceedingly grieved: and he would not afflict the spirit of his son Amnon, for he loved him, because he was his firstborn.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.26'>And Absalom said: If thou wilt not come, at least let my brother Amnon, I beseech thee, come with us. And the king said to him: It is not necessary that he should go with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.27'>But Absalom pressed him, so that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. And Absalom made a feast as it were the feast of a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.28'>And Absalom had commanded his servants, saying: Take notice when Amnon shall be drunk with wine, and when I shall say to you: Strike him, and kill him, fear not: for it is I that command you: take courage, and be valiant men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.29'>And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded them. And all the king's sons arose and got up every man upon his mule, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.30'>And while they were yet in the way, a rumour came to David, saying: Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.31'>Then the king rose up, and rent his garments: and fell upon the ground, and all his servants, that stood about him, rent their garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.32'>But Jonadab the son of Semmaa David's brother answering, said: Let not my lord the king think that all the king's sons are slain: Amnon only is dead, for he was appointed by the mouth of Absalom from the day that he ravished his sister Thamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.33'>Now therefore let not my lord the king take this thing into his heart, saying: All the king's sons are slain: for Amnon only is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.34'>But Absalom fled away: and the young man that kept the watch, lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold there came much people by a by-way on the side of the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.35'>And Jonadab said to the king: Behold the king's sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.36'>And when he made an end of speaking, the king's sons also appeared: and coming in they lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.37'>But Absalom fled, and went to Tholomai the son of Ammiud the king of Gessur. And David mourned for his son every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.38'>And Absalom after he was fled, and come into Gessur, was there three years. And king David ceased to pursue after Absalom, because he was comforted concerning the death of Amnon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.2'>And Absalom rising up early stood by the entrance of the gate, and when any man had business to come to the king's judgment, Absalom called him to him, and said: Of what city art thou? He answered, and said: Thy servant is of such a tribe of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.3'>And Absalom answered him: Thy words seem to me good and just. But there is no man appointed by the king to hear thee. And Absalom said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.4'>O that they would make me judge over the land, that all that have business might come to me, that I might do them justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.5'>Moreover when any man came to him to salute him, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.6'>And this he did to all Israel that came for judgment, to be heard by the king, and he enticed the hearts of the men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.7'>And after forty years, Absalom said to king David: Let me go, and pay my vows which I have vowed to the Lord in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.8'>For thy servant made avow, when he was in Gessur of Syria, saying: If the Lord shall bring me again into Jerusalem I will offer sacrifice to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.9'>And king David said to him: Go in peace. And he arose, and went to Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.10'>And Absalom sent spies into all the tribes of Israel, saying: As soon as you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, say ye: Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.11'>Now there went with Absalom two hundred men out of Jerusalem that were called, going with simplicity of heart, and knowing nothing of the design.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.12'>Absalom also sent for Achitophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city Gilo. And while he was offering sacrifices, there was a strong conspiracy, and the people running together increased with Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.13'>And there came a messenger to David, saying: All Israel with their whole heart followeth Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.14'>And David said to his servants, that were with him in Jerusalem: Arise and let us flee: for we shall not escape else from the face of Absalom: make haste to go out, lest he come and overtake us, and bring ruin upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.15'>And the king's servants said to him: Whatsoever our lord the king shall command, we thy servants will willingly execute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.16'>And the king went forth, and all his household on foot: and the king left ten women his concubines to keep the house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.17'>And the king going forth and all Israel on foot, stood afar off from the house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.18'>And all his servants walked by him, and the bands of the Cerethi, and the Phelethi, and all the Gethites, valiant warriors, six hundred men who had followed him from Geth on foot, went before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.19'>And the king said to Ethai the Gethite: Why comest thou with us? return and dwell with the king, for thou art a stranger, and art come out of thy own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.20'>Yesterday thou camest, and to day shalt thou be forced to go forth with us? but I shall go whither I am going: return thou, and take back thy brethren with thee, and the Lord will shew thee mercy, and truth, because thou hast shewn grace and fidelity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.21'>And Ethai answered the king, saying: As the Lord liveth, and as my lord the king liveth: in what place soever thou shalt be, my lord, O king, either in death, or in life, there will thy servant be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.22'>And David said to Ethai: Come, and pass over. And Ethai the Gethite passed, and all the men that were with him, and the rest of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.23'>And they all wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself went over the brook Cedron, and all the people marched towards the way that looketh to the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.24'>And Sadoc the priest also came, and all the Levites with him carrying the ark of the covenant of God, and they set down the ark of God: and Abiathar went up, till all the people that was come out of the city had done passing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.25'>And the king said to Sadoc: Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find grace in the sight of the Lord, he will bring me again, and he will shew me it, and his tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.26'>But if he shall say to me: Thou pleasest me not: I am ready, let him do that which is good before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.27'>And the king said to Sadoc the priest: O seer, return into the city in peace: and let Achimaas thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons, be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.28'>Behold I will lie hid in the plains of the wilderness, till there come word from you to certify me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.29'>So Sadoc and Abiathar carried back the ark of God into Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.30'>But David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, going up and weeping, walking barefoot, and with his head covered, and all the people that were with them, went up with their heads covered weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.31'>And it was told David that Achitophel also was in the conspiracy with Absalom, and David said: Infatuate, O Lord, I beseech thee, the counsel of Achitophel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.32'>And when David was come to the top of the mountain, where he was about to adore the Lord, behold Chusai the Arachite, came to meet him with his garment rent and his head covered with earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.33'>And David said to him: If thou come with me, thou wilt be a burden to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.34'>But if thou return into the city, and wilt say to Absalom: I am thy servant, O king: as I have been thy father's servant, so I will be thy servant: thou shalt defeat the counsel of Achitophel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.35'>And thou hast with thee Sadoc, and Abiathar the priests: and what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.36'>And there are with them their two sons Achimaas the son of Sadoc, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar: and you shall send by them to me every thing that you shall hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.37'>Then Chusai the friend of David went into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.16'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.1'>And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold Siba the servant of Miphiboseth came to meet him with two asses, laden with two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs, and a vessel of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.2'>And the king said to Siba: What mean these things? And Siba answered: The asses are for the king's household to sit on: and the loaves and the figs for thy servants to eat, and the wine to drink if any man be faint in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.3'>And the king said: Where is thy master's son? And Siba answered the king: He remained in Jerusalem, saying: To day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.4'>And the king said to Siba: I give thee all that belonged to Miphiboseth. And Siba said: I beseech thee let me find grace before thee, my lord, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.5'>And king David came as far as Bahurim: and behold there came out from thence a man of the kindred of the house of Saul named Semei, the son of Gera, and coming out he cursed as he went on,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.6'>And he threw stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people, and all the warriors walked on the right, and on the left side of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.7'>And thus said Semei when he cursed the king: Come out, come out, thou man of blood, and thou man of Belial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.8'>The Lord hath repaid thee for all the blood of the house of Saul: because thou hast usurped the kingdom in his stead, and the Lord hath given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and behold thy evils press upon thee, because thou art a man of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.9'>And Abisai the son of Sarvia said to the king: Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? I will go, and cut off his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.10'>And the king said: What have I to do with you, ye sons of Sarvia? Let him alone and let him curse: for the Lord hath bid him curse David: and who is he that shall dare say, why hath he done so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.11'>And the king said to Abisai, and to all his servants: Behold my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now a son of Jemini? let him alone that he may curse as the Lord hath bidden him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.12'>Perhaps the Lord may look upon my affliction, and the Lord may render me good for the cursing of this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.13'>And David and his men with him went by the way. And Semei by the hill's side went over against him, cursing, and casting stones at him, and scattering earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.14'>And the king and all the people with him came weary, and refreshed themselves there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.15'>But Absalom and all his people came into Jerusalem, and Achitophel was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.16'>And when Chusai the Arachite, David's friend, was come to Absalom, he said to him: God save thee, O king, God save thee, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.17'>And Absalom said to him: Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Why wentest thou not with thy friend?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.18'>And Chusai answered Absalom: Nay: for I will be his, whom the Lord hath chosen, and all this people, and all Israel, and with him will I abide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.19'>Besides this, whom shall I serve? is it not the king's son? as I have served thy father, so will I serve thee also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.20'>And Absalom said to Achitophel: Consult what we are to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.21'>And Achitophel said to Absalom: Go in to the concubines of thy father, whom he hath left to keep the house: that when all Israel shall hear that thou hast disgraced thy father, their hands may be strengthened with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.22'>So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and he went in to his father's concubines before all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.23'>Now the counsel of Achitophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man should consult God: so was all the counsel of Achitophel, both when he was with David, and when he was with Absalom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.17'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.1'>And Achitophel said to Absalom: I will choose me twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.2'>And coming upon him (for he is now weary, and weak handed) I will defeat him: and when all the people is put to flight that is with him, I will kill the king who will be left alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.3'>And I will bring back all the people, as if they were but one man: for thou seekest but one man: and all the people shall be in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.4'>And his saying pleased Absalom, and all the ancients of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.5'>But Absalom said: Call Chusai the Arachite, and let us hear what he also saith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.6'>And when Chusai was come to Absalom, Absalom said to him: Achitophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do it or not? what counsel dost thou give?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.7'>And Chusai said to Absalom: The counsel that Achitophel hath given this time is not good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.8'>And again Chusai said: Thou knowest thy father, and the men that are with him, that they are very valiant, and bitter in their mind, as a bear raging in the wood when her whelps are taken away: and thy father is a warrior, and will not lodge with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.9'>Perhaps he now lieth hid in pits, or in some other place where he list: and when any one shall fall at the first, every one that heareth it shall say: There is a slaughter among the people that followed Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.10'>And the most valiant man whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall melt for fear: for all the people of Israel know thy father to be a valiant man, and that all who are with him are valiant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.11'>But this seemeth to me to be good counsel: Let all Israel be gathered to thee, from Dan to Bersabee, as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered: and thou shalt be in the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.12'>And we shall come upon him in what place soever he shall be found: and we shall cover him, as the dew falleth upon the ground, and we shall not leave of the men that are with him, not so much as one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.13'>And if he shall enter into any city, all Israel shall cast ropes round about that city, and we will draw it into the river, so that there shall not be found so much as one small stone thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.14'>And Absalom, and all the men of Israel said: The counsel of Chusai the Arachite is better than the counsel of Achitophel: and by the will of the Lord the profitable counsel of Achitophel was defeated, that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.15'>And Chusai said to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests: Thus and thus did Achitophel counsel Absalom, and the ancients of Israel: and thus and thus did I counsel them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.16'>Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying: Tarry not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but without delay pass over: lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.17'>And Jonathan and Achimaas stayed by the fountain Rogel: and there went a maid and told them: and they went forward, to carry the message to king David, for they might not be seen, nor enter into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.18'>But a certain boy saw them, and told Absalom: but they making haste went into the house of a certain man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court, and they went down into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.19'>And a woman took, and spread a covering over the mouth of the well, as it were to dry sodden barley: and so the thing was not known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.20'>And when Absalom's servants were come into the house, they said to the woman: Where is Achimaas and Jonathan? and the woman answered them: They passed on in haste, after they had tasted a little water. But they that sought them, when they found them not, returned into Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.21'>And when they were gone, they came up out of the well, and going on told king David, and said: Arise, and pass quickly over the river: for this manner of counsel has Achitophel given against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.22'>So David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan, until it grew light, and not one of them was left that was not gone over the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.23'>But Achitophel seeing that his counsel was not followed, saddled his ass, and arose and went home to his house and to his city, and putting his house in order, hanged himself, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.24'>But David came to the camp, and Absalom passed over the Jordan, be and all the men of Israel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.25'>Now Absalom appointed Amasa in Joab's stead over the army: and Amasa was the son of a man who was called Jethra of Jezrael, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Naas, the sister of Sarvia who was the mother of Joab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.26'>And Israel camped with Absalom in the land of Galaad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.27'>And when David was come to the camp, Sobi the son of Naas of Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammihel of Lodabar, and Berzellai the Galaadite of Rogelim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.28'>Brought him beds, and tapestry, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and fried pulse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.29'>And honey, and butter, and sheep, and fat calves, and they gave to David and the people that were with him, to eat: for they suspected that the people were faint with hunger and thirst in the wilderness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.18'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.1'>And David having reviewed his people, appointed over them captains of thousands and of hundreds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.2'>And sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abisai the son of Sarvia Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ethai, who was of Geth: and the king said to the people: I also will go forth with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.3'>And the people answered: Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not much mind us: or if half of us should fall, they will not greatly care: for thou alone art accounted for ten thousand: it is better therefore that thou shouldst be in the city to succour us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.4'>And the king said to them: What seemeth good to you, that will I do. And the king stood by the gate: and all the people went forth by their troops, by hundreds and by thousands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.5'>And the king commanded Joab, and Abisai, and Ethai, saying: Save me the boy Absalom. And all the people heard the king giving charge to all the princes concerning Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.6'>So the people went out into the field against Israel and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.7'>And the people of Israel were defeated there by David's army, and a great slaughter was made that day of twenty thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.8'>And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the country, and there were many more of the people whom the forest consumed, than whom the sword devoured that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.9'>And it happened that Absalom met he servants of David, riding on a mule: and as the mule went under a thick and large oak, his head stuck in the oak: and while he hung between the heaven and he earth, the mule on which he rode passed on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.10'>And one saw this and told Joab, saying: I saw Absalom hanging upon an oak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.11'>And Joab said to the man that told him: If thou sawest him, why didst thou not stab him to the ground, and I would have given thee ten sicles of silver, and belt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.12'>And he said to Joab: If thou wouldst have paid down in my hands a thousand pieces of silver, I would not lay my hands upon the king's son: for in our hearing he king charged thee, and Abisai, and Ethai, saying: Save me the boy Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.13'>Yea and if I should have acted boldly against my own life, this could not have been hid from the king, and wouldst thou have stood by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.14'>And Joab said: Not as thou wilt, but will set upon him in thy sight. So he took three lances in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absalom: and whilst he yet panted for life, sticking on the oak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.15'>Ten young men, armourbearers of Joab, ran up, and striking him slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.16'>And Joab sounded the trumpet, and kept back the people from pursuing after Israel in their flight, being willing to spare he multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.17'>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the forest, and they laid an exceeding great heap of stories upon him: but all Israel fled to their own dwellings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.18'>Now Absalom had reared up for himself, in his lifetime, a pillar, which is in the king's valley: for he said: I have no son, and this shall be the monument of my name. And he called the pillar by is own name, and it is called the hand of Absalom, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.19'>And Achimaas the son of Sadoc said: I will run and tell the king, that the Lord hath done judgment for him from the hand of his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.20'>And Joab said to him: Thou shalt not be the messenger this day, but shalt bear tidings another day: this day I will not have thee bear tidings, because the king's son is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.21'>And Joab said to Chusai: Go, and tell the king what thou hast seen. Chusai bowed down to Joab, and ran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.22'>Then Achimaas the son of Sadoc said to Joab again: Why might not I also run after Chusai? And Joab said to him: Why wilt thou run, my son? thou wilt not be the bearer of good tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.23'>He answered: But what if I run? And he said to him: Run. Then Achimaas running by a nearer way passed Chusai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.24'>And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman that was on the top of the gate upon the wall, lifting up his eyes, saw a man running alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.25'>And crying out he told the king: and the king said: If he be alone, there are good tidings in his mouth. And as he was coming apace, and drawing nearer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.26'>The watchman saw another man running, and crying aloud from above, he said: I see another man running alone. And the king said: He also is a good messenger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.27'>And the watchman said: The running of the foremost seemeth to me like the running of Achimaas the son of Sadoc. And the king said: He is a good man: and cometh with good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.28'>And Achimaas crying out, said to the king: God save thee, O king. And falling down before the king with his face to the ground, he said: Blessed be the Lord thy God, who hath shut up the men that have lifted up their hands against the lord my king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.29'>And the king said: Is the young man Absalom safe? And Achimaas said: I saw a great tumult, O king, when thy servant Joab sent me thy servant: I know nothing else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.30'>And the king said to him: Pass, and stand here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.31'>And when he bad passed, and stood still, Chusai appeared: and coming up he said: I bring good tidings, my lord, the king, for the Lord hath judged for thee this day from the hand of all that have risen up against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.32'>And the king said to Chusai: Is the young man Absalom safe? And Chusai answering him, said: Let the enemies of my lord, the king, and all that rise against him unto evil, be as the young man is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.33'>The king therefore being much moved, went up to the high chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went he spoke in this manner: My son Absalom, Absalom my son: would to God that I might die for thee, Absalom my son, my son Absalom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.19'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.1'>And it was told Joab, that the king wept and mourned for his son:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.2'>And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day: The king grieveth for his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.3'>And the people shunned the going into the city that day as a people would do that hath turned their backs, and fled away from the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.4'>And the king covered his head, and cried with a loud voice: O my son Absalom, O Absalom my son, O my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.5'>Then Joab going into the house to the king, said: Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, that have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons, and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.6'>Thou lovest them that hate thee, and thou hatest them that love thee: and thou hast shewn this day that thou carest not for thy nobles, nor for thy servants: and I now plainly perceive that if Absalom had lived, and all we had been slain, then it would have pleased thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.7'>Now therefore arise, and go out, and speak to the satisfaction of thy servants: for I swear to thee by the Lord, that if thou wilt not go forth, there will not tarry with thee so much as one this night: and that will be worse to thee, than all the evils that have befallen thee from thy youth until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.8'>Then the king arose and sat in the gate: and it was told to all the people that the king sat in the gate: and all the people came before the king, but Israel fled to their own dwellings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.9'>And all the people were at strife in all the tribes of Israel, saying: The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines: and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.10'>But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in the battle: how long are you silent, and bring not back the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.11'>And king David sent to Sadoc, and Abiathar the priests, saying: Speak to the ancients of Juda, saying: Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? (For the talk of all Israel was come to the king in his house.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.12'>You are my brethren, you are my bone, and my flesh, why are you the last to bring back the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.13'>And say ye to Amasa: Art not thou my bone, and my flesh? So do God to me and add more, if thou be not the chief captain of the army before me always in the place of Joab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.14'>And be inclined the heart of all the men of Juda, as it were of one man: and they sent to the king, saying: Return thou, and all thy servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.15'>And the king returned and came as far as the Jordan, and all Juda came as far as Galgal to meet the king, and to bring him over the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.16'>And Semei the son of Gera the son of Jemini of Bahurim, made haste and went down with the men of Juda to meet king David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.17'>With a thousand men of Benjamin, and Siba the servant of the house of Saul: and his fifteen sons, and twenty servants were with him: and going over the Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.18'>They passed the fords before the king, that they might help over the king's household, and do according to his commandment. And Semei the son of Gera falling down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.19'>Said to him: Impute not to me, my lord, the iniquity, nor remember the injuries of thy servant on the day that thou, my lord, the king, wentest out of Jerusalem, nor lay it up in thy heart, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.20'>For I thy servant acknowledge my sin: and therefore I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph, and am come down to meet my lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.21'>But Abisai the son of Sarvia answering, said: Shall Semei for these words not be put to death, because he cursed the Lord's anointed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.22'>And David said: What have I to do with you, ye sons of Sarvia? why are you a satan this day to me? shall there any man be killed this day in Israel? do not I know that this day I am made king over Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.23'>And the king said to Semei: Thou shalt not die. And he swore unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.24'>And Miphiboseth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and he had neither washed his feet, nor trimmed his beard: nor washed his garments from the day that the king went out, until the day of his return in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.25'>And when he met the king at Jerusalem, the king said to him: Why camest thou not with me, Miphiboseth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.26'>And he answering, said: My lord, O king, my servant despised me: for I thy servant spoke to him to saddle me an ass, that I might get on and go with the king: for I thy servant am lame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.27'>Moreover he hath also accused me thy servant to thee, my lord the king: but thou my lord the king art as an angel of God, do what pleaseth thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.28'>For all of my father's house were no better than worthy of death before my lord the king; and thou hast set me thy servant among the guests of thy table: what just complaint therefore have I? or what right to cry any more to the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.29'>Then the king said to him: Why speakest thou any more? what I have said is determined: thou and Siba divide the possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.30'>And Miphiboseth answered the king: Yea, let him take all, for as much as my lord the king is returned peaceably into his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.31'>Berzellai also the Galaadite coming down from Rogelim, brought the king over the Jordan, being ready also to wait on him beyond the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.32'>Now Berzellai the Galaadite was of a great age, that is to say, fourscore years old, and he provided the king with sustenance when he abode in the camp: for he was a man exceeding rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.33'>And the king said to Berzellai: Come with me that thou mayest rest secure with me in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.34'>And Berzellai said to the king: How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.35'>I am this day fourscore years old, are my senses quick to discern sweet and bitter? or can meat or drink delight thy servant? or can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? why should thy servant be a burden to my lord, the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.36'>I thy servant will go on a little way from the Jordan with thee: I need not this recompense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.37'>But I beseech thee let thy servant return, and die in my own city, and be buried by the sepulchre of my father, and of my mother. But there is thy servant Chamaam, let him go with thee, my lord, the king, and do to him whatsoever seemeth good to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.38'>Then the king said to him: Let Chamaam go over with me, and I will do for him whatsoever shall please thee, and all that thou shalt ask of me, thou shalt obtain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.39'>And when all the people and the king had passed over the Jordan, the king kissed Berzellai, and blessed him: and he returned to his own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.40'>So the king went on to Galgal, and Chamaam with him. Now all the people of Juda had brought the king over, and only half of the people of Israel were there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.41'>Therefore all the men of Israel running together to the king, said to him: Why have our brethren the men of Juda stolen thee away, and have brought the king and his household over the Jordan, and all the men of David with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.42'>And all the men of Juda answered the men of Israel: Because the king is nearer to me: why art thou angry for this matter? have we eaten any thing of the king's, or have any gifts been given us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.43'>And the men of Israel answered the men of Juda, and said: I have ten parts in the king more than thou, and David belongeth to me more than to thee: why hast thou done me a wrong, and why was it not told me first, that I might bring back my king? And the men of Juda answered more harshly than the men of Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.20'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.1'>And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Seba, the son of Bochri, a man of Jemini: and he sounded the trumpet, and said: We have no part in David, nor inheritance in the son of Isai: return to thy dwellings, O Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.2'>And all Israel departed from David, and followed Seba the son of Bochri: but the men of Juda stuck to their king from the Jordan unto Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.3'>And when the king was come into his house at Jerusalem, he took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, allowing them provisions: and he went not in unto them, but they were shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.4'>And the king said to Amasa: Assemble to me all the men of Juda against the third day, and be thou here present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.5'>So Amasa went to assemble the men of Juda, but he tarried beyond the set time which the king had appointed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.6'>And David said to Abisai: Now will Seba the son of Bochri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou therefore the servants of thy lord, and pursue after him, lest he find fenced cities, and escape us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.7'>So Joab's men went out with him, and the Cerethi and the Phelethi: and all the valiant men went out of Jerusalem to pursue after Seba the son of Bochri.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.8'>And when they were at the great stone which is in Gabaon, Amasa coming met them. And Joab had on a close coat of equal length with his habit, and over it was girded with a sword hanging down to his flank, in a scabbard, made in such manner as to come out with the least motion and strike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.9'>And Joab said to Amasa: God save thee, my brother. And he took Amasa by the chin with his right hand to kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.10'>But Amasa did not take notice of the sword, which Joab had, and he struck him in the side, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and gave him not a second wound, and he died. And Joab, and Abisai his brother pursued after Seba the son of Bochri.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.11'>In the mean time some men of Joab's company stopping at the dead body of Amasa, said: Behold he that would have been in Joab's stead the companion of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.12'>And Amasa imbrued with blood, lay in the midst of the way. A certain man saw this that all the people stood still to look upon him, so he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and covered him with a garment, that they who passed might not stop on his account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.13'>And when he was removed out of the way, all the people went on following Joab to pursue after Seba the son of Bochri.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.14'>Now he had passed through all the tribes of Israel unto Abela and Bethmaacha: and all the chosen men were gathered together unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.15'>And they came, and besieged him in Abela, and in Bethmaacha, and they cast up works round the city, and the city was besieged: and all the people that were with Joab, laboured to throw down the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.16'>And a wise woman cried out from the city: Hear, hear, and say to Joab: Come near hither, and I will speak with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.17'>And when he was come near to her, she said to him: Art thou Joab? And he answered: I am. And she spoke thus to him: Hear the words of thy handmaid. He answered: I do hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.18'>And she again said: A saying was used in the old proverb: They that inquire, let them inquire in Abela: and so they made an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.19'>Am not I she that answer truth in Israel, and thou seekest to destroy the city, and to overthrow a mother in Israel? Why wilt thou throw down the inheritance of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.20'>And Joab answering said: God forbid, God forbid that I should, I do not throw down, nor destroy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.21'>The matter is not so, but a man of mount Ephraim, Seba the son of Bochri by name, hath lifted up his hand against king David: deliver him only, and we will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab: Behold his head shall be thrown to thee from the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.22'>So she went to all the people, and spoke to them wisely: and they cut off the head of Seba the son of Bochri, and cast it out to Joab. And he sounded the trumpet, and they departed from the city, every one to their home: and Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.23'>So Joab was over all the army of Israel: and Banaias the son of Joiada was over the Cerethites and Phelethites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.24'>But Aduram over the tributes: and Josaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.25'>And Siva was scribe: and Sadoc and Abiathar, priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.26'>And Ira the Jairite was the priest of David.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.21'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.1'>And there was a famine in the days of David for three years successively: and David consulted the oracle of the Lord. And the Lord said: It is for Saul, and his bloody house, because he slew the Gabaonites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.2'>Then the king, calling for the Gabaonites, said to them: (Now the Gabaonites were not of the children of Israel, but the remains of the Amorrhites: I and the children of Israel had sworn to them, and Saul sought to slay them out of zeal, as it were for the children of Israel and Juda:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.3'>David therefore said to the Gabaonites: What shall I do for you? and what shall be the atonement for you, that you may bless the inheritance of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.4'>And the Gabaonites said to him: We have no contest about silver and gold, but against Saul and against his house: neither do we desire that any man be slain of Israel. And the king said to them: What will you then that I should do for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.5'>And they said to the king: The man that crushed us and oppressed us unjustly, we must destroy in such manner that there be not so much as one left of his stock in all the coasts of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.6'>Let seven men of his children be delivered unto us, that we may crucify them to the Lord in Gabaa of Saul, once the chosen of the Lord. And the king said: I will give them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.7'>And the king spared Miphiboseth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the oath of the Lord, that had been between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.8'>So the king took the two sons of Respha the daughter of Aia, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni, and Miphiboseth: and the five sons of Michol the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Hadriel the son of Berzellai, that was of Molathi:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.9'>And gave them into the hands of the Gabaonites: and they crucified them on a hill before the Lord: and these seven died together in the first days of the harvest, when the barley began to be reaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.10'>And Respha the daughter of Aia took haircloth, and spread it under her upon the rock from the beginning of the harvest, till water dropped upon them out of heaven: and suffered neither the birds to tear them by day, nor the beasts by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.11'>And it was told David, what Respha the daughter of Aia, the concubine of Saul, had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.12'>And David went, and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabes Galaad, who had stolen them from the street of Bethsan, where the Philistines had hanged them when they had slain Saul in Gelboe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.13'>And he brought from thence the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, and they gathered up the bones of them that were crucified,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.15'>And the Philistines made war again against Israel, and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. And David growing faint,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.16'>Jesbibenob, who was of the race of Arapha, the iron of whose spear weighed three hundred ounces, being girded with a new sword, attempted to kill David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.17'>And Abisai the son of Sarvia rescued him, and striking the Philistine killed him. Then David's men swore unto him, saying: Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, lest thou put out the lamp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.18'>There was also a second battle in Gob against the Philistines: then Sobochai of Husathi slew Saph of the race of Arapha of the family of the giants.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.23'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.1'>Now these are David's last words. David the son of Isai said: The man to whom it was appointed concerning the Christ of the God of Jacob, the excellent psalmist of Israel said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.2'>The spirit of the Lord hath spoken by me and his word by my tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.3'>The God of Israel said to me, the strong one of Israel spoke, the ruler of men, the just ruler in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.4'>As the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, shineth in the morning without clouds, and as the grass springeth out of the earth by rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.5'>Neither is my house so great with God, that he should make with me an eternal covenant, firm in all things and assured. For he is all my salvation, and all my will: neither is there ought thereof that springeth not up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.6'>But transgressors shall all of them be plucked up as thorns: which are not taken away with hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.7'>And if a man will touch them, he must be armed with iron and with the staff of a lance: but they shall be set on fire and burnt to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.8'>These are the names of the valiant men of David. Jesbaham sitting in the chair was the wisest chief among the three, he was like the most tender little worm of the wood, who killed eight hundred men at one onset.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.9'>After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three valiant men that were with David when they defied the Philistines, and they were there gathered together to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.10'>And when the men of Israel were gone away, he stood and smote the Philistines till his hand was weary, and grew stiff with the sword: and the Lord wrought a great victory that day: and the people that were fled away, returned to take spoils of them that were slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.11'>And after him was Semma the son of Age of Arari. And the Philistines were gathered together in a troop: for there was a field full of lentils. And when the people were fled from the face of the Philistines,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.12'>He stood in the midst of the field, and defended it, and defeated the Philistines: and the Lord gave a great victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.13'>Moreover also before this the three who were princes among the thirty, went down and came to David in the harvest time into the cave of Odollam: and the camp of the Philistines was in the valley of the giants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.14'>And David was then in a hold. and there was a garrison of the Philistines then in Bethlehem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.15'>And David longed, and said: O that some man would get me a drink of the water out of the cistern, that is in Bethlehem, by the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.16'>And the three valiant men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the cistern of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and brought it to David: but he would not drink, but offered it to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.17'>Saying: The Lord be merciful to me, that I may not do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that went, and the peril of their lives? therefore he would not drink. These things did these three mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.18'>Abisai also the brother of Joab, the son of Sarvia, was chief among three: and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew, and he was renowned among the three,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.19'>And the noblest of three, and was their chief, but to the three first he attained not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.20'>And Banaias the son of Joiada a most valiant man, of great deeds, of Cabseel: he slew the two lions of Moab, and he went down, and slew a lion in the midst of a pit, in the time of snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.21'>He also slew an Egyptian, a man worthy to be a sight, having a spear in his hand: but he went down to him with a rod, and forced the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian, and slew him with his own spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.22'>These things did Banaias the son of Joiada.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.23'>And he was renowned among the three valiant men, who were the most honourable among the thirty: but he attained riot to the first three: and David made him of his privy council.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.24'>Asael the brother of Joab was one of the thirty, Elehanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.1'>And the anger of the Lord was again kindled against Israel, and stirred up David among them, saying: Go, number Israel and Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.2'>And the king said to Joab the general of his army: Go through all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Bersabee, and number ye the people that I may know the number of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.3'>And Joab said to the king: The Lord thy God increase thy people, and make them as many more as they are now, and again multiply them a hundredfold in the sight of my lord the king: but what meaneth my lord the king by this kind of thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.4'>But the king's words prevailed over the words of Joab, and of the captains of the army: and Joab, and the captains of the soldiers went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.5'>And when they had passed the Jordan, they came to Aroer to the right side of the city, which is in the vale of Gad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.6'>And by Jazer they passed into Galaad, and to the lower land of Hodsi, and they came into the woodlands of Dan. And going about by Sidon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.7'>They passed near the walls of Tyre, and all the land of the Hevite, and the Chanaanite, and they came to the south of Juda into Bersabee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.8'>And having gone through the whole land, after nine months and twenty days, they came to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.9'>And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to the king, and there were found of Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword: and of Juda five hundred thousand fighting men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.10'>But David's heart struck him, after the people were numbered: and David said to the Lord: I have sinned very much in what I have done: but I pray thee, O Lord, to take away the iniquity of thy servant, because I have done exceeding foolishly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.11'>And David arose in the morning, and the word of the Lord came to Gad the prophet and the seer of David, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.12'>Go, and say to David: Thus saith the Lord: I give thee thy choice of three things, choose one of them which thou wilt, that I may do it to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.13'>And when Gad was come to David, he told him, saying: Either seven years of famine shall come to thee in thy land: or thou shalt flee three months before thy adversaries, and they shall pursue thee: or for three days there shall be a pestilence in thy land.

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.16'>And when the angel of the Lord had stretched out his hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord had pity on the affliction, and said to the angel that slew the people: It is enough: now hold thy hand.

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.17'>And David said to the Lord, when he saw the angel striking the people: It is I; I am he that have sinned, I have done wickedly: these that are the sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I beseech thee, be turned against me, and against my father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.18'>And Gad came to David that day, and said: Go up, and build an altar to the Lord in the thrashingfloor of Areuna the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.19'>And David went up according to the word of Gad which the Lord had commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.20'>And Areuna looked, and saw the king and his servants coming towards him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.21'>An going out he worshipped the king, bowing with his face to the earth, and said: Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant?

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.22'>And Areuna said to David: Let my lord the king take, and offer, as it seemeth good to him: thou hast here oxen for a holocaust, and the wain, and the yokes of the oxen for wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.23'>All these things Areuna as a king gave to the king: and Areuna said to the king: The Lord thy God receive thy vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.24'>And the king answered him, and said: Nay, but I will buy it of thee at a price, and I will not offer to the Lord my God holocausts free cost. So David bought the floor, and the oxen, for fifty sicles of silver:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.25'>And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered holocausts and peace offerings: and the Lord became merciful to the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</verse>
