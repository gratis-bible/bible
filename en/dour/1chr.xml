        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.3'>Now over and above the things which I have offered into the house of my God I give of my own proper goods, gold and silver for the temple of my God, beside what things I have prepared for the holy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.4'>Three thousand talents of gold of the gold of Ophir: and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.5'>And gold for wheresoever there is need of gold: and silver for wheresoever there is need of silver, for the works to be made by the hands of the artificers: now if any man is willing to offer, let him fill his hand to day, and offer what he pleaseth to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.6'>Then the heads of the families, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and the overseers of the king's possessions promised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.7'>And they gave for the works of the house of the Lord, of gold, five thousand talents, and ten thousand solids: of silver ten thousand talents: and of brass eighteen thousand talents: and of iron a hundred thousand talents.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.10'>And he blessed the Lord before all the multitude, and he said: Blessed art thou, O Lord the God of Israel, our father from eternity to eternity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.11'>Thine, O Lord, is magnificence, and power, and glory, and victory: and to thee is praise: for all that is in heaven, and in earth, is thine: thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art above all princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.12'>Thine are riches, and thine is glory, thou hast dominion over all, in thy hand is power and might: in thy hand greatness, and the empire of all things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.16'>O Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name, is from thy hand, and all things are thine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.17'>I know my God that thou provest hearts, and lovest simplicity, wherefore I also in the simplicity of my heart, have joyfully offered all these things: and I have seen with great joy thy people, which are here present, offer thee their offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.18'>O Lord God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Israel our fathers, keep for ever this will of their heart, and let this mind remain always for the worship of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.19'>And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, that he may keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy ceremonies, and do all things: and build the house, for which I have provided the charges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.20'>And David commanded all the assembly: Bless ye the Lord our God. And all the assembly blessed the Lord the God of their fathers: and they bowed themselves and worshipped God, and then the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.21'>And they sacrificed victims to the Lord: and they offered holocausts the next day, a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their libations, and with every thing prescribed most abundantly for all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.22'>And they ate, and drank before the Lord that day with great joy. And they anointed the second time Solomon the son of David. And they anointed him to the Lord to be prince, end Sadoc to be high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.23'>And Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father, and he pleased all: and all Israel obeyed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.24'>And all the princes, and men of power, and all the sons of king David gave their hand, and were subject to Solomon the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.25'>And the Lord magnified Solomon over all Israel: and gave him the glory of a reign, such as no king of Israel had before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.26'>So David the son of Isai reigned over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.27'>And the days that he reigned over Israel, were forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem three and thirty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.28'>And he died in a good age, full of days, and riches, and glory. And Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.29'>Now the acts of king David first and last are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.30'>And of all his reign, and his valour, and of the times that passed under him, either in Israel, or in all the kingdoms of the countries.</verse>
