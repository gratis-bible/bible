Be ye therefore wise as serpents and simple as doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But beware of men. For they will deliver you up in councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you shall be brought before governors, and before kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when they shall deliver you up, take no thought how or what to speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The brother also shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the son: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and shall put them to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall be hated by all men for my name's sake: but he that shall persevere unto the end, he shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they shall persecute you in this city, flee into another. Amen I say to you, you shall not finish all the cities of Israel, till the Son of man come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The disciple is not above the master, nor the servant above his lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the goodman of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore fear them not. For nothing is covered that shall not be revealed: nor hid, that shall not be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That which I tell you in the dark, speak ye in the light: and that which you hear in the ear, preach ye upon the housetops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And fear ye not them that kill the body, and are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him that can destroy both soul and body in hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Fear not therefore: better are you than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Every one therefore that shall confess me before men, I will also confess him before my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he that shall deny me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Do not think that I came to send peace upon earth: I came not to send peace, but the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as a man's enemies shall be they of his own household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he that taketh not up his cross, and followeth me, is not worthy of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He that findeth his life, shall lose it: and he that shall lose his life for me, shall find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He that receiveth you, receiveth me: and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive the reward of a prophet: and he that receiveth a just man in the name of a just man, shall receive the reward of a just man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, amen I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
