      <chapter osisID='Lam.1'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.1'>Aleph. How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people! how is the mistress of the Gentiles become as a widow: the princes of provinces made tributary!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.2'>Beth. Weeping she hath wept in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: there is none to comfort her among all them that were dear to her: all her friends have despised her, and are become her enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.3'>Ghimel. Juda hath removed her dwelling place because of her affliction, and the greatness of her bondage: she hath dwelt among the nations, and she hath found no rest: all her persecutors have taken her in the midst of straits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.4'>Daleth. The ways of Sion mourn, because there are none that come to the solemn feast: all her gates are broken down: her priests sigh: her virgins are in affliction, and she is oppressed with bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.5'>He. Her adversaries are become her lords, her enemies are enriched: because the Lord hath spoken against her for the multitude of her iniquities: her children are led into captivity: before the face of the oppressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.6'>Vau. And from the daughter of Sion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like rams that find no pastures: and they are gone away without strength before the face of the pursuer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.7'>Zain. Jerusalem hath remembered the days of her affliction, and prevarication of all her desirable things which she had from the days of old, when her people fell in the enemy's hand, and there was no helper: the enemies have seen her, and have mocked at her sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.8'>Heth. Jerusalem hath grievously sinned, therefore is she become unstable: all that honoured her have despised her, because they have seen her shame: but she sighed and turned backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.9'>Teth. Her filthiness is on her feet, and she hath not remembered her end: she is wonderfully cast down, not having a comforter: behold, O Lord, my affliction, because the enemy is lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.10'>Jod. The enemy hath put out his hand to all her desirable things: for she hath seen the Gentiles enter into her sanctuary, of whom thou gavest commandment that they should not enter into thy church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.11'>Caph. All her people sigh, they seek bread: they have given all their precious things for food to relieve the soul: see, O Lord, and consider, for I am become vile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.12'>Lamed. O all ye that pass by the way, attend, and see if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow: for he hath made a vintage of me, as the Lord spoke in the day of his fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.13'>Mem. From above he hath sent fire into my bones, and hath chastised me: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate, wasted with sorrow all the day long.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.14'>Nun. The yoke of my iniquities hath watched: they are folded together in his hand, and put upon my neck: my strength is weakened: the Lord hath delivered me into a hand out of which I am not able to rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.15'>Samech. The Lord hath taken away all my mighty men out of the midst of me: he hath called against me the time, to destroy my chosen men: the Lord hath trodden the winepress for the virgin daughter of Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.16'>Ain. Therefore do I weep, and my eyes run down with water: because the comforter, the relief of my soul, is far from me: my children are desolate because the enemy hath prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.17'>Phe. Sion hath spread forth her hands, there is none to comfort her: the Lord hath commanded against Jacob, his enemies are round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.18'>Sade. The Lord is just, for I have provoked his mouth to wrath: hear, I pray you, all ye people, and see my sorrow: my virgins, and my young men are gone into captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.19'>Coph. I called for my friends, but they deceived me: my priests and my ancients pined away in the city: while they sought their food, to relieve their souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.20'>Res. Behold, O Lord, for I am in distress, my bowels are troubled: my heart is turned within me, for I am full of bitterness: abroad the sword destroyeth, and at home there is death alike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.21'>Sin. They have heard that I sigh, and there is none to comfort me: all my enemies have heard of my evil, they have rejoiced that thou hast done it: thou hast brought a day of consolation, and they shall be like unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.22'>Thau. Let all their evil be present before thee: and make vintage of them, as thou hast made vintage of me for all my iniquities: for my sighs are many, and my heart is sorrowful.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.2'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.1'>Aleph. How hath the Lord covered with obscurity the daughter of Sion in his wrath! how hath he cast down from heaven to the earth the glorious one of Israel, and hath not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.2'>Beth. The Lord hath cast down headlong, and hath not spared, all that was beautiful in Jacob: he hath destroyed in his wrath the strong holds of the virgin of Juda, and brought them down to the ground: he hath made the kingdom unclean, and the princes thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.3'>Ghimel. He hath broken in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy: and he hath kindled in Jacob as it were a flaming fire devouring round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.4'>Daleth. He hath bent his bow as an enemy, he hath fixed his right hand as an adversary: and he hath killed all that was fair to behold in the tabernacle of the daughter of Sion, he hath poured out his indignation like fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.5'>He. The Lord is become as an enemy: he hath cast down Israel headlong, he hath overthrown all the walls thereof: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath multiplied in the daughter of Juda the afflicted, both men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.6'>Vau. And he hath destroyed his tent as a garden, he hath thrown down his tabernacle: the Lord hath caused feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Sion: and hath delivered up king and priest to reproach, and to the indignation of his wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.7'>Zain. The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath cursed his sanctuary: he hath delivered the walls of the towers thereof into the hand of the enemy: they have made a noise in the house of the Lord, as in the day of a solemn feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.8'>Heth. The Lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Sion: he hath stretched out his line, and hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: and the bulwark hath mourned, and the wall hath been destroyed together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.9'>Teth. Her gates are sunk into the ground: he hath destroyed, and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more, and her prophets have found no vision from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.10'>Jod. The ancients of the daughter of Sion sit upon the ground, they have held their peace: they have sprinkled their heads with dust, they are girded with haircloth, the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.11'>Caph. My eyes have failed with weeping, my bowels are troubled: my liver is poured out upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people, when the children, and the sucklings, fainted away in the streets of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.12'>Lamed. They said to their mothers: Where is corn and wine? when they fainted away as the wounded in the streets of the city: when they breathed out their souls in the bosoms of their mothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.13'>Mem. To what shall I compare thee? or to what shall I liken thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? to what shall I equal thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Sion? for great as the sea is thy destruction: who shall heal thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.14'>Nun. Thy prophets have seen false and foolish things for thee: and they have not laid open thy iniquity, to excite thee to penance: but they have seen for thee false revelations and banishments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.15'>Samech. All they that passed by the way have clapped their hands at thee: they have hissed, and wagged their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying: Is this the city of perfect beauty, the joy of all the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.16'>Phe. All thy enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they have hissed, and gnashed with the teeth, and have said: We will swallow her up: lo, this is the day which we looked for: we have found it, we have seen it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.17'>Ain. The Lord hath done that which he purposed, he hath fulfilled his word, which he commanded in the days of old: he hath destroyed, and hath not spared, and he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee, and hath set up the horn of thy adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.18'>Sade. Their heart cried to the Lord upon the walls of the daughter of Sion: Let tears run down like a torrent day and night: give thyself no rest, and let not the apple of thy eye cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.19'>Coph. Arise, give praise in the night, in the beginning of the watches: pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands to him for the life of thy little children, that have fainted for hunger at the top of all the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.20'>Res. Behold, O Lord, and consider whom thou hast thus dealt with: shall women then eat their own fruit, their children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.21'>Sin. The child and the old man lie without on the ground: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: thou hast slain them in the day of thy wrath: thou hast killed, and shewn them no pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.22'>Thau. Thou hast called as to a festival, those that should terrify me round about, and there was none in the day of the wrath of the Lord that escaped and was left: those that I brought up, and nourished, my enemy hath consumed them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.3'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.1'>Aleph. I am the man that see my poverty by the rod of his indignation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.2'>Aleph. He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, and not into light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.3'>Aleph. Only against me he hath turned, and turned again his hand all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.4'>Beth. My skin and my flesh he hath made old, he hath broken my bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.5'>Beth. He hath built round about me, and he hath compassed me with gall and labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.6'>Beth. He hath set me in dark places as those that are dead for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.7'>Ghimel. He hath built against me round about, that I may not get out: he hath made my fetters heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.8'>Ghimel. Yea, and when I cry, and entreat, he hath shut out my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.9'>Ghimel. He hath shut up my ways with square stones, he hath turned my paths upside down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.10'>Daleth. He is become to me as a bear lying in wait: as a lion in secret places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.11'>Daleth. He hath turned aside my paths, and hath broken me in pieces, he hath made me desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.12'>Daleth. He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for his arrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.13'>He. He hath shot into my reins the daughters of his quiver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.14'>He. I am made a derision to all my people, their song all the day long.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.15'>He. He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath inebriated me with wormwood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.16'>Vau. And he hath broken my teeth one by one, he hath fed me with ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.17'>Vau. And my soul is removed far off from peace, I have forgotten good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.18'>Vau. And I said: My end and my hope is perished from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.19'>Zain. Remember my poverty, and transgression, the wormwood, and the gall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.20'>Zain. I will be mindful and remember, and my soul shall languish within me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.21'>Zain. These things I shall think over in my heart, therefore will I hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.22'>Heth. The mercies of the Lord that we are not consumed: because his commiserations have not failed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.23'>Heth. They are new every morning, great is thy faithfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.24'>Heth. The Lord is my portion, said my soul: therefore will I wait for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.25'>Teth. The Lord is good to them that hope in him, to the soul that seeketh him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.26'>Teth. It is good to wait with silence for the salvation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.27'>Teth. It is good for a man, when he hath borne the yoke from his youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.28'>Jod. He shall sit solitary, and hold his peace: because he hath taken it up upon himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.29'>Jod. He shall put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.30'>Jod. He shall give his cheek to him that striketh him, he shall be filled with reproaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.31'>Caph. For the Lord will not cast off for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.32'>Caph. For if he hath cast off, he will also have mercy, according to the multitude of his mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.33'>Caph. For he hath not willingly afflicted, nor cast off the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.34'>Lamed. To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.35'>Lamed. To turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the most High,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.36'>Lamed. To destroy a man wrongfully in his judgment, the Lord hath not approved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.37'>Mem. Who is he that hath commanded a thing to be done, when the Lord commandeth it not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.38'>Mem. Shall not both evil and good proceed out of the mouth of the Highest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.39'>Mem. Why hath a living man murmured, man suffering for his sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.40'>Nun. Let us search our ways, and seek, and return to the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.3.42'>Nun. We have done wickedly, and provoked thee to wrath: therefore thou art inexorable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.43'>Samech. Thou hast covered in thy wrath, and hast struck us: thou hast killed and hast not spared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.44'>Samech. Thou hast set a cloud before thee, that our prayer may not pass through.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.45'>Samech. Thou hast made me as an outcast, and refuse in the midst of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.46'>Phe. All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.3.49'>Ain. My eye is afflicted, and hath not been quiet, because there was no rest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.50'>Ain. Till the Lord regarded and looked down from the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.51'>Ain. My eye hath wasted my soul because of all the daughters of my city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.52'>Sade. My enemies have chased me and caught me like a bird, without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.53'>Sade. My life is fallen into the pit, and they have laid a stone over me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.54'>Sade. Waters have flowed over my head: I said: I am cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.55'>Coph. I have called upon thy name, O Lord, from the lowest pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.56'>Coph. Thou hast heard my voice: turn not away thy ear from my sighs, and cries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.57'>Coph. Thou drewest near in the day, when I called upon thee, thou saidst: Fear not.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.3.63'>Sin. Behold their sitting down, and their rising up, I am their song.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.64'>Thau. Thou shalt render them a recompense, O Lord, according to the works of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.65'>Thau. Thou shalt give them a buckler of heart, thy labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.66'>Thau. Thou shalt persecute them in anger, and shalt destroy them from under the heavens, O Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.4'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.1'>Aleph. How is the gold become dim, the finest colour is changed, the stones of the sanctuary are scattered in the top of every street?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.2'>Beth. The noble sons of Sion, and they that were clothed with the best gold: how are they esteemed as earthen vessels, the work of the potter's hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.3'>Ghimel. Even the sea monsters have drawn out the breast, they have given suck to their young: the daughter of my people is cruel, like the ostrich in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.4'>Daleth. The tongue of the sucking child hath stuck to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the little ones have asked for bread, and there was none to break it unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.5'>He. They that were fed delicately have died in the streets; they that were brought up in scarlet have embraced the dung.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.6'>Vau. And the iniquity of the daughter of my people is made greater than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, and hands took nothing in her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.7'>Zain. Her Nazarites were whiter than snow, purer than milk, more ruddy than the old ivory, fairer than the sapphire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.8'>Heth. Their face is now made blacker than coals, and they are not known in the streets: their skin hath stuck to their bones, it is withered, and is become like wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.9'>Teth. It was better with them that were slain by the sword, than with them that died with hunger: for these pined away being consumed for want of the fruits of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.10'>Jod. The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.11'>Caph. The Lord hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger: and he hath kindled a fire in Sion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.12'>Lamed. The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world would not have believed, that the adversary and the enemy should enter in by the gates of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.13'>Mem. For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.14'>Nun. They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they were defiled with blood: and when they could not help walking in it, they held up their skirts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.15'>Samech. Depart you that are defiled, they cried out to them: Depart, get ye hence, touch not: for they quarrelled, and being removed, they said among the Gentiles: He will no more dwell among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.16'>Phe. The face of the Lord hath divided them, he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, neither had they pity on the ancient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.17'>Ain. While we were yet standing, our eyes failed, expecting help for us in vain, when we looked attentively towards a nation that was not able to save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.18'>Sade. Our steps have slipped in the way of our streets, our end draweth near: our days are fulfilled, for our end is come.</verse>
