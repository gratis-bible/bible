  <div type='book' osisID='1Kgs'>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>Now king David was old, and advanced in years: and when he was covered with clothes, he was not warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>His servants therefore said to him: Let us seek for our lord the king, a young virgin, and let her stand before the king, and cherish him, and sleep in his bosom, and warm our lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>So they sought a beautiful young woman in all the coasts of Israel, and they found Abisag a Sunamitess, and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>And the damsel was exceeding beautiful, and she slept with the king: and served him, but the king did not know her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>And Adonias the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying: I will be king. And he made himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>Neither did his father rebuke him at any time, saying: Why hast thou done this? And he also was very beautiful, the next in birth after Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>And he conferred with Joab the son of Sarvia, and with Abiathar the priest, who furthered Adonias's side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But Sadoc the priest, and Banaias the son of Joiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Semei, and Rei, and the strength of David's army was not with Adonias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>And Adonias having slain rams and calves, and all fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which was near the fountain Rogel, invited all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Juda, the king's servants:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>But Nathan the prophet, and Banaias, and all the valiant men, and Solomon his brother, he invited not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>And Nathan said to Bethsabee the mother of Solomon: Hast thou not heard that Adonias the son of Haggith reigneth, and our lord David knoweth it not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>Now then come, take my counsel and save thy life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Go, and get thee in to king David, and say to him: Didst not thou, my lord O king, swear to me thy handmaid, saying: Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then doth Adonias reign?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>And while thou art yet speaking there with the king, I will come in after thee, and will fill up thy words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>So Bethsabee went in to the king into the chamber: now the king was very old, and Abisag the Sunamitess ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>Bethsabee bowed herself, and worshipped the king. And the king said to her: What is thy will?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>She answered and said: My lord, thou didst swear to thy handmaid by the Lord thy God, saying: Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>And behold now Adonias reigneth, and thou, my lord the king, knowest nothing of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>He hath killed oxen, and all fat cattle, and many rams, and invited all the king's sons, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the general of the army: but Solomon thy servant he invited not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>And now, my lord O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldst tell them, who shall sit on thy throne, my lord the king, after thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king sleepeth with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>As she was yet speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>And they told the king, saying: Nathan the prophet is here. And when he was come in before the king, and had worshipped, bowing down to the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>Nathan said: My lord O king, hast thou said: Let Adonias reign after me, and let him sit upon my throne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>Because he is gone down to day, and hath killed oxen, and fatlings, and many rams, and invited all the king's sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest: and they are eating and drinking before him, and saying: God save king Adonias:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>But me thy servant, and Sadoc the priest, and Banaias the son of Joiada, and Solomon thy servant he hath not invited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>Is this word come out from my lord the king, and hast thou not told me thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>And king David answered and said: Call to me Bethsabee. And when she was come in to the king, and stood before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>The king swore and said: As the Lord liveth, who hath delivered my soul out of all distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>Even as I swore to thee by the Lord the God of Israel, saying: Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead, so will I do this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>And Bethsabee bowing with her face to the earth worshipped the king, saying: May my lord David live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>King David also said: Call me Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaias the son of Joiada. And when they were come in before the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>He said to them: Take with you the servants of your lord, and set my son Solomon upon my mule: and bring him to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>And let Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and you shall sound the trumpet, and shall say: God save king Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>And you shall come up after him, and he shall come, and shall sit upon my throne, and he shall reign in my stead: and I will appoint him to be ruler over Israel, and over Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>And Banaias the son of Joiada answered the king, saying: Amen: so say the Lord the God of my lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, so be he with Solomon, and make his throne higher than the throne of my lord king David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>So Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet went down, and Banaias the son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and Phelethi: and they set Solomon upon the mule of king David, and brought him to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>And Sadoc the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon: and they sounded the trumpet, and all the people said: God save king Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>And all the multitude went up after him, and the people played with pipes, and rejoiced with a great joy, and the earth rang with the noise of their cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>And Adonias, and all that were invited by him, heard it, and now the feast was at an end: Joab also hearing the sound of the trumpet, said: What meaneth this noise of the city in an uproar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>While he yet spoke, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonias said to him: Come in, because thou art a valiant man, and bringest good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>And Jonathan answered Adonias: Not so: for our lord king David hath appointed Solomon king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>And hath sent with him Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaias the son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and Phelethi, and they have set him upon the king's mule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>And Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are gone up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again: this is the noise that you have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>Moreover Solomon sitteth upon the throne of the kingdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>And the king's servants going in have blessed our lord king David, saying: May God make the name of Solomon greater than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king adored in his bed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>And he said: Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who hath given this day one to sit on my throne, my eyes seeing</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>Then all the guests of Adonias were afraid, and they all arose and every man went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>And Adonias fearing Solomon, arose, and went, and took hold on the horn of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>And they told Solomon, saying: Behold Adonias, fearing king Solomon, hath taken hold of the horn of the altar, saying: Let king Solomon swear to me this day, that he will not kill his servant with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>And Solomon said: If he be a good man, there shall not so much as one hair of his head fall to the ground: but if evil be found in him, he shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>Then king Solomon sent, and brought him out from the altar: and going in he worshipped king Solomon: and Solomon said to him: Go to thy house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>And the days of David drew nigh that he should die, and he charged his son Solomon, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>I am going the way of all flesh: take thou courage, and shew thyself a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and observe his ceremonies, and his precepts, and judgments, and testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses: that thou mayest understand all thou dost, and whithersoever thou shalt turn thyself :</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>That the Lord may confirm his words, which he hath spoken of me, saying: If thy children shall take heed to their ways, and shall walk before me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul, there shall not be taken away from thee a man on the throne of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>Thou knowest also what Joab the son of Sarvia hath done to me, what he did to the two captains of the army of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether: whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head go down to hell in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>But shew kindness to the sons of Berzellai the Galaadite, and let them eat at thy table: t for they met me when I fled from the face of Absalom thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>Thou hast also with thee Semei the son of Gera the son of Jemini of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse, when I went to the camp: but because he came down to meet me when I passed over the Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying: I will not kill thee with a sword:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>Do not thou hold him guiltless. But thou art a wise man, and knowest what to do with him, and thou shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>And the days that David reigned in Israel, were forty gears: in Hebron he reigned seven years, in Jerusalem thirty-three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>And Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was strengthened exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>And Adonias the son of Haggith came to Bethsabee the mother of Solomon. And she said to him: Is thy coming peaceable? he answered: Peaceable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>And he added: I have a word to speak with thee. She said to him: Speak. And he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>Thou knowest that the kingdom was nine, and all Israel had preferred me to be their king: but the kingdom is transferred, and is become my brother's: for it was appointed him by the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>Now therefore I ask one petition of thee: turn not away my face. And she said to him: Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>And he said: I pray thee speak to king Solomon (for he cannot deny thee any thing) to give me Abisag the Sunamitess to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>And Bethsabee said: Well, I will speak for thee to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>Then Bethsabee came to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonias: and the king arose to meet her, and bowed to her, and sat down upon his throne: and a throne was set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>And she said to him: I desire one small petition of thee, do not put me to confusion. And the king said to her: My mother, ask: for I must not turn away thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>And she said: Let Abisag the Sunamitess be given to Adonias thy brother to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>And king Solomon answered, and said to his mother: Why dost thou ask Abisag the Sunamitess for Adonias? ask for him also the kingdom: for he is my elder brother, and hath Abiathar the priest, and Joab the son of Sarvia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>Then king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying: So and so may God do to me, and add more, if Adonias hath not spoken this word against his own life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>And now as the Lord liveth, who hath established me, and placed me upon the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, Adonias shall be put to death this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Banaias the son of Joiada, who slew him, and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>And the king said also to Abiathar the priest: Go to Anathoth to thy lands, for indeed thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst carry the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and hast endured trouble in all the troubles my father endured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>So Solomon cast out Abiathar, from being the priest of the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning the house of Deli in Silo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>And the news came to Joab, because Joab had turned after Adonias, and had not turned after Solomon: and Joab fled into the tabernacle of the Lord and laid hold on the horn of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>And it was told king Solomon, that Joab was fled into the tabernacle of the Lord, and was by the altar: and Solomon sent Banaias the son of Joiada, saying: Go, kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>And Banaias came to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him: Thus saith the king: Come forth. And he said: I will not come forth, but here I will die. Banaias brought word back to the king, saying: Thus saith Joab, and thus he answered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>And the king said to him: Do as he hath said: and kill him, and bury him, and thou shalt remove the innocent blood which hath been shed by Joab, from me, and from the house of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>And the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head, because he murdered two men, just and better than himself: and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing it, Abner the son of Ner, general of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, general of the army of Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>And their blood shall return the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever. But to David and his seed and his house, and to his throne be peace for ever from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.34'>So Banaias the son of Joiada went up, and setting upon him slew him, and he was buried in his house in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.35'>And the king appointed Banaias the son of Joiada in his room over the army, and Sadoc the priest he put in the place of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.36'>The king also sent, and called for Semei, and said to him: Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there: and go not out from thence any whither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.37'>For on what day soever thou shalt go out, and shalt pass over the brook Cedron, know that thou shalt be put to death: thy blood shall be upon thy own head:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.38'>And Semei said to the king: The saying is good : as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Semei dwelt in Jerusalem, many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.39'>And it came to pass after three years, that the servants of Semei ran away to Achis the son of Maacha the king of Geth: and it was told Semei that his servants were gone to Geth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.40'>And Semei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Achis to Geth to seek his servants, and he brought them out of Geth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.41'>And it was told Solomon that Semei had gone from Jerusalem to Geth, and was come back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.42'>And sending he called for him, and said to him: Did I not protest to thee by the Lord, and tell thee before: On what day soever thou shalt go out and walk abroad any whither, know that thou shalt die? And thou answeredst me: The word that I have heard is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.43'>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment that I laid upon thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.44'>And the king said to Semei: Thou knowest all the evil, of which thy heart is conscious, which thou didst to David my father: the Lord hath returned thy wickedness upon thy own head:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.45'>And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.46'>So the king commanded Banaias the son of Joiada: and he went out and struck him, and he died.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon, and he made affinity with Pharao the king of Egypt: for he took his daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>But yet the people sacrificed in the high places: far there was no temple built to the name of the Lord until that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the precepts of David his father, only he sacrificed in the high places: and burnt incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>He went therefore to Gabaon, to sacrifice there: for that was the great high place: a thousand victims for holocausts did Solomon offer upon that altar in Gabaon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.5'>And the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, saying : Ask what thou wilt that I should give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.6'>And Solomon said: Thou hast shewn great mercy to thy servant David my father, even at, he walked before thee in truth, and justice, and an upright heart with thee: and thou hast kept thy great mercy for him, and hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.7'>And now, O Lord God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a child, and know not how to go out and come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.8'>And thy servant is in the midst of the people which thou hast chosen, an immense people, which cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.9'>Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart, to judge thy people, and discern between good and evil. For who shall be able to judge this people, thy people which is so numerous?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.10'>And the word was pleasing to the Lord that Solomon had asked such a thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.11'>And the Lord said to Solomon: Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life or riches, nor the lives of thy enemies, but hast asked for thyself wisdom to discern judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.12'>Behold I have done for thee according to thy words, and have given thee a wise and understanding heart, insomuch that there hath been no one like thee before thee, nor shall arise after thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.13'>Yea and the things also which thou didst not ask, I have given thee: to wit riches and glory, as that no one hath been like thee among the kings in all days heretofore.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.15'>And it came to pass when Jezabel heard that Naboth was stoned, and dead, that she said to Achab: Arise and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezrahelite, who would not agree with thee, and give it thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.16'>And when Achab heard this, to wit, that Naboth was dead, he arose, and went down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezrahelite, to take possession of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.17'>And the word of the Lord came to Elias the Thesbite, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.18'>Arise, and go down to meet Achab king of Israel, who is in Samaria: behold he is going down to the vineyard of Naboth, to take possession of it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.19'>And thou shalt speak to him, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Thou hast slain, moreover also thou hast taken possession. And after these words thou shalt add: Thus saith the Lord: In this place, wherein the dogs have licked the blood of Naboth, they shall lick thy blood also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.20'>And Achab said to Elias: Hast thou found me thy enemy? He said: I have found thee, because thou art sold, to do evil in the sight of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.21'>Behold I will bring evil upon thee, and I will cut down thy posterity, and I will kill of Achab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up, and the last in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.22'>And I will make thy house like the t house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and like the house of Baasa the son of Ahias: for what thou hast done, to provoke me to anger, and for making Israel to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.23'>And of Jezabel also the Lord spoke, saying: The dogs shall eat Jezabel in the field of Jezrahel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.24'>If Achab die in the city, the dogs shall eat him: but if he die in the field, the birds of the air shall eat him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.25'>Now there was not such another as Achab, who was sold to do evil in the sight of the Lord: for his wife Jezabel set him on,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.26'>And he became abominable, insomuch that he followed the idols which the Amorrhites had made, whom the Lord destroyed before the face of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.27'>And when Achab had heard these words, he rent his garments, and put haircloth upon his flesh, and fasted and slept in sackcloth, and walked with his head cast down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.28'>And the word of the Lord came to Elias the Thesbite, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.29'>Hast thou not seen Achab humbled before me? therefore, because he hath humbled himself for my sake, I will not bring the evil in his days, but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.18'>(Then the king of Israel said to Josaphat: Did I not tell thee, that he prophesieth no good to me, but always evil ?)</verse>
