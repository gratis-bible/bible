Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Which is not another, only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I made progress in the Jews' religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when it pleased him, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem, to see Peter, and I tarried with him fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past, doth now preach the faith which once he impugned:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they glorified God in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
