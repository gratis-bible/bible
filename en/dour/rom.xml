  <div type='book' osisID='Rom'>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>Which he had promised before, by his prophets, in the holy scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>Concerning his Son, who was made to him of the seed of David, according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>Who was predestinated the Son of God in power, according to the spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>By whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith, in all nations, for his name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>To all that are at Rome, the beloved of God, called to be saints. Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, for you all, because your faith is spoken of in the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make a commemoration of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>Always in my prayers making request, if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey, by the will of God, to come unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual grace, to strengthen you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>That is to say, that I may be comforted together in you, by that which is common to us both, your faith and mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come unto you, (and have been hindered hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>To the Greeks and to the barbarians, to the wise and to the unwise, I am a debtor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>So (as much as is in me) I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are at Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>For the justice of God is revealed therein, from faith unto faith, as it is written: The just man liveth by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and injustice of those men that detain the truth of God in injustice:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>Because that which is known of God is manifest in them. For God hath manifested it unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; his eternal power also, and divinity: so that they are inexcusable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>Because that, when they knew God, they have not glorified him as God, or given thanks; but became vain in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>For professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and of fourfooted beasts, and of creeping things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Wherefore God gave them up to the desires of their heart, unto uncleanness, to dishonour their own bodies among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>Who changed the truth of God into a lie; and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>For this cause God delivered them up to shameful affections. For their women have changed the natural use into that use which is against nature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>And, in like manner, the men also, leaving the natural use of the women, have burned in their lusts one towards another, men with men working that which is filthy, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was due to their error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And as they liked not to have God in their knowledge, God delivered them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not convenient;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>Being filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice, wickedness, full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity, whisperers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>Detractors, hateful to God, contumelious, proud, haughty, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>Foolish, dissolute, without affection, without fidelity, without mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>Who, having known the justice of God, did not understand that they who do such things, are worthy of death; and not only they that do them, but they also that consent to them that do them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Wherefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them that do such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longsuffering? Knowest thou not, that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath, and revelation of the just judgment of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>Who will render to every man according to his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>To them indeed, who according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>But to them that are contentious, and who obey not the truth, but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>But glory, and honour, and peace to every one that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>For there is no respect of persons with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>For whosoever have sinned without the law, shall perish without the law; and whosoever have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those things that are of the law; these having not the law are a law to themselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to them, and their thoughts between themselves accusing, or also defending one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>But if thou art called a Jew and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>And knowest his will, and approvest the more profitable things, being instructed by the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest not thyself: thou that preachest that men should not steal, stealest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>Thou that sayest, men should not commit adultery, committest adultery: thou that abhorrest idols, committest sacrilege:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>(For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>Circumcision profiteth indeed, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>If, then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For it is not he is a Jew, who is so outwardly; nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>But he is a Jew, that is one inwardly; and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What advantage then hath the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much every way. First indeed, because the words of God were committed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For what if some of them have not believed? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>But God is true; and every man a liar, as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy words, and mayest overcome when thou art judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who executeth wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>(I speak according to man.) God forbid: otherwise how shall God judge this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>And not rather (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil, that there may come good? whose damnation is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have charged both Jews, and Greeks, that they are all under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>As it is written: There is not any man just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>All have turned out of the way; they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, there is not so much as one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>Their feet swift to shed blood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>Destruction and misery in their ways:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>And the way of peace they have not known:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know, that what things soever the law speaketh, it speaketh to them that are in the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be made subject to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now without the law the justice of God is made manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them that believe in him: for there is no distinction:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>For all have sinned, and do need the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption, that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to the shewing of his justice, for the remission of former sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice in this time; that he himself may be just, and the justifier of him, who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>For it is one God, that justifieth circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we, then, destroy the law through faith? God forbid: but we establish the law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What shall we say then that Abraham hath found, who is our father according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>But to him that worketh not, yet believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reputed to justice, according to the purpose of the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>As David also termeth the blessedness of a man, to whom God reputeth justice without works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>This blessedness then, doth it remain in the circumcision only, or in the uncircumcision also? For we say that unto Abraham faith was reputed to justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How then was it reputed? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith, which he had, being uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all them that believe, being uncircumcised, that unto them also it may be reputed to justice:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>And might be the father of circumcision; not to them only, that are of the circumcision, but to them also that follow the steps of the faithful, that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For not through the law was the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world; but through the justice of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, the promise is made of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>For the law worketh wrath. For where there is no law, neither is there transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise might be firm to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>(As it is written: I have made thee a father of many nations,) before God, whom he believed, who quickeneth the dead; and calleth those things that are not, as those that are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>Who against hope believed in hope; that he might be made the father of many nations, according to that which was said to him: So shall thy seed be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>And he was not weak in faith; neither did he consider his own body now dead, whereas he was almost an hundred years old, nor the dead womb of Sara.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust; but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>Most fully knowing, that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now it is not written only for him, that it was reputed to him unto justice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we believe in him, that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>Who was delivered up for our sins, and rose again for our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Being justified therefore by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>By whom also we have access through faith into this grace, wherein we stand, and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only so; but we glory also in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>And patience trial; and trial hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>And hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>For scarce for a just man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God commendeth his charity towards us; because when as yet we were sinners, according to the time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Christ died for us; much more therefore, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only so; but also we glory in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world, and by sin death; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>For until the law sin was in the world; but sin was not imputed, when the law was not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them also who have not sinned after the similitude of the transgression of Adam, who is a figure of him who was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the offence of one, many died; much more the grace of God, and the gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation; but grace is of many offences, unto justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if by one man's offence death reigned through one; much more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift, and of justice, shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation; so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners; so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>Now the law entered in, that sin might abound. And where sin abounded, grace did more abound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>That as sin hath reigned to death; so also grace might reign by justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What shall we say, then? shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>God forbid. For we that are dead to sin, how shall we live any longer therein?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Know you not that all we, who are baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>For we are buried together with him by baptism into death; that as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin may be destroyed, to the end that we may serve sin no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For he that is dead is justified from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall live also together with Christ:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>Neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity unto sin; but present yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of justice unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>For sin shall not have dominion over you; for you are not under the law, but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Know you not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) that the law hath dominion over a man, as long as it liveth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For the woman that hath an husband, whilst her husband liveth is bound to the law. But if her husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>Therefore, whilst her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress, if she be with another man: but if her husband be dead, she is delivered from the law of her husband; so that she is not an adulteress, if she be with another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>Therefore, my brethren, you also are become dead to the law, by the body of Christ; that you may belong to another, who is risen again from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members, to bring forth fruit unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now we are loosed from the law of death, wherein we were detained; so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? God forbid. But I do not know sin, but by the law; for I had not known concupiscence, if the law did not say: Thou shalt not covet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>But sin taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>And I lived some time without the law. But when the commandment came, sin revived,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>And I died. And the commandment that was ordained to life, the same was found to be unto death to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, seduced me, and by it killed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>Wherefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Was that then which is good, made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it may appear sin, by that which is good, wrought death in me; that sin, by the commandment, might become sinful above measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For that which I work, I understand not. For I do not that good which I will; but the evil which I hate, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>If then I do that which I will not, I consent to the law, that it is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>For I know that there dwelleth not in me, that is to say, in my flesh, that which is good. For to will, is present with me; but to accomplish that which is good, I find not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil which I will not, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>Now if I do that which I will not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>I find then a law, that when I have a will to do good, evil is present with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I am delighted with the law of God, according to the inward man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>But I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind, and captivating me in the law of sin, that is in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>Unhappy man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>The grace of God, by Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, I myself, with the mind serve the law of God; but with the flesh, the law of sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>There is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath delivered me from the law of sin and of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh; God sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh and of sin, hath condemned sin in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>For they that are according to the flesh, mind the things that are of the flesh; but they that are according to the spirit, mind the things that are of the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>For the wisdom of the flesh is death; but the wisdom of the spirit is life and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither can it be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>And they who are in the flesh, cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead, because of sin; but the spirit liveth, because of justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you; he that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: Abba (Father).</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>And if sons, heirs also; heirs indeed of God, and joint heirs with Christ: yet so, if we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come, that shall be revealed in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him that made it subject, in hope:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>For we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain, even till now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen, is not hope. For what a man seeth, why doth he hope for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for that which we see not, we wait for it with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity. For we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>And he that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what the Spirit desireth; because he asketh for the saints according to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>And we know that to them that love God, all things work together unto good, to such as, according to his purpose, are called to be saints.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who is against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>He that spared not even his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how hath he not also, with him, given us all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who shall accuse against the elect of God? God that justifieth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who is he that shall condemn? Christ Jesus that died, yea that is risen also again; who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? or distress? or famine? or nakedness? or danger? or persecution? or the sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>(As it is written: For thy sake we are put to death all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>But in all these things we overcome, because of him that hath loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor might,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>For if thou wert cut out of the wild olive tree, which is natural to thee; and, contrary to nature, were grafted into the good olive tree; how much more shall they that are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, (lest you should be wise in your own conceits), that blindness in part has happened in Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles should come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>And so all Israel should be saved, as it is written: There shall come out of Sion, he that shall deliver, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>And this is to them my covenant: when I shall take away their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are most dear for the sake of the fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>For as you also in times past did not believe God, but now have obtained mercy, through their unbelief;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>So these also now have not believed, for your mercy, that they also may obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>For God hath concluded all in unbelief, that he may have mercy on all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his judgments, and how unsearchable his ways!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.34'>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his counsellor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.35'>Or who hath first given to him, and recompense shall be made him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.36'>For of him, and by him, and in him, are all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.12.1'>I BESEECH you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing unto God, your reasonable service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.2'>And be not conformed to this world; but be reformed in the newness of your mind, that you may prove what is the good, and the acceptable, and the perfect will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>For I say, by the grace that is given me, to all that are among you, not to be more wise than it behoveth to be wise, but to be wise unto sobriety, and according as God hath divided to every one the measure of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.4'>For as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.5'>So we being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.6'>And having different gifts, according to the grace that is given us, either prophecy, to be used according to the rule of faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.7'>Or ministry, in ministering; or he that teacheth, in doctrine;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.8'>He that exhorteth, in exhorting; he that giveth, with simplicity; he that ruleth, with carefulness; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.9'>Let love be without dissimulation. Hating that which is evil, cleaving to that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.10'>Loving one another with the charity of brotherhood, with honour preventing one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.11'>In carefulness not slothful. In spirit fervent. Serving the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.12'>Rejoicing in hope. Patient in tribulation. Instant in prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.13'>Communicating to the necessities of the saints. Pursuing hospitality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.14'>Bless them that persecute you: bless, and curse not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.15'>Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.16'>Being of one mind one towards another. Not minding high things, but consenting to the humble. Be not wise in your own conceits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.17'>To no man rendering evil for evil. Providing good things, not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.18'>If it be possible, as much as is in you, have peace with all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.19'>Revenge not yourselves, my dearly beloved; but give place unto wrath, for it is written: Revenge is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.20'>But if thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat; if he thirst, give him to drink. For, doing this, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>Let every soul be subject to higher powers: for there is no power but from God: and those that are, are ordained of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>Therefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God. And they that resist, purchase to themselves damnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good: and thou shalt have praise from the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>For he is God's minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is God's minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>Wherefore be subject of necessity, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>For therefore also you pay tribute. For they are the ministers of God, serving unto this purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>Render therefore to all men their dues. Tribute, to whom tribute is due: custom, to whom custom: fear, to whom fear: honour, to whom honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another. For he that loveth his neighbour, hath fulfilled the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>For Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness: Thou shalt not covet: and if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this word, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.10'>The love of our neighbour worketh no evil. Love therefore is the fulfilling of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.11'>And that knowing the season; that it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.12'>The night is passed, and the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.13'>Let us walk honestly, as in the day: not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and impurities, not in contention and envy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.14'>But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh in its concupiscences.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.1'>Now him that is weak in faith, take unto you: not in disputes about thoughts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.2'>For one believeth that he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat herbs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? To his own lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>For one judgeth between day and day: and another judgeth every day: let every man abound in his own sense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that eateth, eateth to the Lord: for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth thanks to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>For none of us liveth to himself; and no man dieth to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore, whether we live, or whether we die, we are the Lord's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.9'>For to this end Christ died and rose again; that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or thou, why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.11'>For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.12'>Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>Let us not therefore judge one another any more. But judge this rather, that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brother's way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>For if, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now according to charity. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>Let not then our good be evil spoken of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but justice, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>For he that in this serveth Christ, pleaseth God, and is approved of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>Therefore let us follow after the things that are of peace; and keep the things that are of edification one towards another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>Destroy not the work of God for meat. All things indeed are clean: but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>It is good not to eat flesh, and not to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother is offended, or scandalized, or made weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Blessed is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.23'>But he that discerneth, if he eat, is condemned; because not of faith. For all that is not of faith is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.1'>Now we that are stronger, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.2'>Let every one of you please his neighbour unto good, to edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.3'>For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written: The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.4'>For what things soever were written, were written for our learning: that through patience and the comfort of the scriptures, we might have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.5'>Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one mind one towards another, according to Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.6'>That with one mind, and with one mouth, you may glorify God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.7'>Wherefore receive one another, as Christ also hath received you unto the honour of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.8'>For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.9'>But that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and will sing to thy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.10'>And again he saith: Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.11'>And again: Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and magnify him, all ye people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.12'>And again Isaias saith: There shall be a root of Jesse; and he that shall rise up to rule the Gentiles, in him the Gentiles shall hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.13'>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing; that you may abound in hope, and in the power of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.14'>And I myself also, my brethren, am assured of you, that you also are full of love, replenished with all knowledge, so that you are able to admonish one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>But I have written to you, brethren, more boldly in some sort, as it were putting you in mind: because of the grace which is given me from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.16'>That I should be the minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles; sanctifying the gospel of God, that the oblation of the Gentiles may be made acceptable and sanctified in the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.17'>I have therefore glory in Christ Jesus towards God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>For I dare not to speak of any of those things which Christ worketh not by me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>By the virtue of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Ghost, so that from Jerusalem round about as far as unto Illyricum, I have replenished the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>And I have so preached this gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>But as it is written: They to whom he was not spoken of, shall see, and they that have not heard shall understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>For which cause also I was hindered very much from coming to you, and have been kept away till now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>But now having no more place in these countries, and having a great desire these many years past to come unto you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>When I shall begin to take my journey into Spain, I hope that as I pass, I shall see you, and be brought on my way thither by you, if first, in part, I shall have enjoyed you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>But now I shall go to Jerusalem, to minister unto the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a contribution for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>For it hath pleased them; and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also in carnal things to minister to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>When therefore I shall have accomplished this, and consigned to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>And I know, that when I come to you, I shall come in the abundance of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>I beseech you therefore, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the charity of the Holy Ghost, that you help me in your prayers for me to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>That I may be delivered from the unbelievers that are in Judea, and that the oblation of my service may be acceptable in Jerusalem to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.32'>That I may come to you with joy, by the will of God, and may be refreshed with you.</verse>
