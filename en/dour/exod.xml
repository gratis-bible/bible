      <chapter osisID='Exod.1'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.1'>These are the names of the children of Israel, that went into Egypt with Jacob: they went in, every man with his household:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.2'>Ruben, Simeon, Levi, Juda,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.3'>Issachar, Zabulon, and Benjamin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.4'>Dan, and Nephtali, Gad and Aser.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.5'>And all the souls that came out of Jacob's thigh, were seventy: but Joseph was in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.6'>After he was dead, and all his brethren, and all that generation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.7'>The children of Israel increased, and sprung up into multitudes, and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.8'>In the mean time there arose a new king over Egypt, that knew not Joseph:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.9'>And he said to his people: Behold the people of the children of Israel are numerous and stronger than we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.10'>Come, let us wisely oppress them, lest they multiply: and if any war shall rise against us, join with our enemies, and having overcome us, depart out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.11'>Therefore he set over them masters of the works, to afflict them with burdens, and they built for Pharao cities of tabernacles, Phithom and Ramesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.12'>But the more they oppressed them, the more they were multiplied, and increased:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.13'>And the Egyptians hated the children of Israel, and afflicted them and mocked them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.14'>And they made their life bitter with hard works in clay, and brick, and with all manner of service, wherewith they were overcharged in the works of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.15'>And the king of Egypt spoke to the midwives of the Hebrews: of whom one was called Sephora, the other Phua,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.16'>Commanding them: When you shall do the office of midwives to the Hebrew women, and the time of delivery is come: if it be a man child, kill it: if a woman, keep it alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.17'>But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded, but saved the men children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.18'>And the king called for them and said: What is that you meant to do, that you would save the men children ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.19'>They answered: The Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women: for they themselves are skillful in the office of a midwife; and they are delivered before we come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.20'>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied and grew exceedingly strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.21'>And because the midwives feared God, he built them houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.22'>Pharao therefore charged all his people, saying: Whatsoever shall be born of the male sex, ye shall cast into the river: whatsoever of the female, ye shall save alive.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.2'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.1'>After this there went a man of the house of Levi; and took a wife of his own kindred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.2'>And she conceived, and bore a son; and seeing him a goodly child hid him three months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.3'>And when she could hide him no longer, she took a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch: and put the little babe therein, and laid him in the sedges by the river's brink,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.4'>His sister standing afar off, and taking notice what would be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.5'>And behold the daughter of Pharao came down to wash herself in the river: and her maids walked by the river's brink. And when she saw the basket in the sedges, she sent one of her maids for it: and when it was brought,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.6'>She opened it and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it she said: This is one of the babes of the Hebrews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.7'>And the child's sister said to her Shall I go and call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.8'>She answered: Go. The maid went and called her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.9'>And Pharao's daughter said to her. Take this child and nurse him for me: I will give thee thy wages. The woman took, and nursed the child: and when he was grown up, she delivered him to Pharao's daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.10'>And she adopted him for a son, and called him Moses, saying: Because I took him out of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.11'>In those days after Moses was grown up, he went out to his brethren: and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.12'>And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no one there, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.13'>And going out the next day, he saw two Hebrews quarreling: and he said to him that did the wrong: Why strikest thou thy neighbour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.14'>But he answered: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us: wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian? Moses feared, and said: How is this come to be known ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.15'>And Pharao heard of this word and sought to kill Moses: but he fled from his sight, and abode in the land of Madian, and he sat down by a well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.16'>And the priest of Madian had seven daughters, who came to draw water: and when the troughs were filled, desired to water their father's flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.17'>And the shepherds came and drove them away: and Moses arose, and defending the maids, watered their sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.18'>And when they returned to Raguel their father, he said to them: Why are ye come sooner than usual?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.19'>They answered: A man of Egypt delivered us from the hands of the shepherds: and he drew water also with us, and gave the sheep to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.20'>But he said: Where is he? why have you let the man go? call him that he may eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.21'>And Moses swore that he would dwell with him. And he took Sephora his daughter to wife:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.22'>And she bore him a son, whom he called Gersam, saying: I have been a stranger in a foreign country. And she bore another, whom he called Eliezer, saying: For the God of my father, my helper hath delivered me out of the hand of Pharao.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.23'>Now after a long time the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel groaning, cried out because of the works: and their cry went up unto God from the works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.24'>And he heard their groaning, and remembered the covenant which he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.25'>And the Lord looked upon the children of Israel, and he knew them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.3'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.1'>Now Moses fed the sheep of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Madian: and he drove the flock to the inner parts of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, Horeb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.2'>And the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he saw that the bush was on fire and was not burnt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.3'>And Moses said: I will go and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.4'>And when the Lord saw that he went forward to see, he called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said: Moses, Moses. And he answered: Here I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.5'>And he said: Come not nigh hither, put off the shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.6'>And he said: I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Moses hid his face: for he durst not look at God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.7'>And the Lord said to him: I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their cry because of the rigour of them that are over the works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.8'>And knowing their sorrow, I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land into a good and spacious land, into a land that floweth with milk and honey, to the places of the Chanaanite, and Hethite, and Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.9'>For the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have seen their affliction, wherewith they are oppressed by the Egyptians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.10'>But come, and I will send thee to Pharao, that thou mayst bring forth my people, the children of Israel out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.11'>And Moses said to God: Who am I that I should go to Pharao, and should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.12'>And he said to him: I will be with thee: and this thou shalt have for a sign, that I have sent thee: When thou shalt have brought my people out of Egypt, thou shalt offer sacrifice to God upon this mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.13'>Moses said to God: Lo, I shall go to the children of Israel, and say to them: The God of your fathers hath sent me to you. If they should say to me: What is his name? what shall I say to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.14'>God said to Moses: I AM WHO AM. He said: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: HE WHO IS, hath sent me to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.15'>And God said again to Moses: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me to you: This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.16'>Go, gather together the ancients of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying: Visiting I have visited you: and I have seen all that hath befallen you in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.17'>And I have said the word to bring you forth out of the affliction of Egypt, into the land of the Chanaanite, the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and Jebusite, to a land that floweth with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.18'>And they shall hear thy voice: and thou shalt go in, thou and the ancients of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and thou shalt say to him: The Lord God of the Hebrews hath called us: we will go three days' journey into the wilderness, to sacrifice unto the Lord our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.19'>But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, but by a mighty hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.20'>For I will stretch forth my hand and will strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of them: after these he will let you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.21'>And I will give favour to this people, in the sight of the Egyptians: and when you go forth, you shall not depart empty:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.22'>But every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that is in her house, vessels of silver and of gold, and raiment: and you shall put them on your sons and daughters, and shall spoil Egypt.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.4'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.1'>Moses answered and said: They will not believe me, nor hear my voice, but they will say: The Lord hath not appeared to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.2'>Then he said to him: What is that thou holdest in thy hand? He answered: A rod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.3'>And the Lord said: Cast it down upon the ground. He cast it down, and it was turned into a serpent: so that Moses fled from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.4'>And the Lord said: Put out thy hand and take it by the tail. He put forth his hand, and took hold of it, and it was turned into a rod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.5'>That they may believe, saith he, that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.6'>And the Lord said again: Put thy hand into thy bosom. And when he had put it into his bosom, he brought it forth leprous as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.7'>And he said: Put back thy hand into thy bosom. He put it back, and brought it out again, and it was like the other flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.8'>If they will not believe thee, saith he, nor hear the voice of the former sign, they will believe the word of the latter sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.9'>But if they will not even believe these two signs, nor hear thy voice: take of the river water, and pour it out upon the dry land, and whatsoever thou drawest out of the river shall be turned into blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.10'>Moses said: I beseech thee, Lord. I am not eloquent from yesterday and the day before: and since thou hast spoken to thy servant, I have more impediment and slowness of tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.11'>The Lord said to him: Who made man's mouth? or who made the dumb and the deaf, the seeing and the blind? did not I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.12'>Go therefore and I will be in thy mouth: and I will teach thee what thou shalt speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.13'>But he said: I beseech thee, Lord send whom thou wilt send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.14'>The Lord being angry at Moses, said Aaron the Levite is thy brother, I know that he is eloquent: behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and seeing thee shall be glad at heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.15'>Speak to him, and put my words in his mouth: and I will be in thy mouth, and in his mouth, and will shew you what you must do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.16'>He shall speak in thy stead to the people, and shall be thy mouth: but thou shalt be to him in those things that pertain to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.17'>And take this rod in thy hand, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.18'>Moses went his way, and returned to Jethro his father in law and said to him: I will go and return to my brethren into Egypt, that I may see if they be yet alive. And Jethro said to him: Go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.19'>And the Lord said to Moses, in Madian: Go, and return into Egypt: for they are all dead that sought thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.20'>Moses therefore took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass: and returned into Egypt, carrying the rod of God in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.21'>And the Lord said to him as he was returning into Egypt: See that thou do all the wonders before Pharao, which I have put in thy hand: I shall harden his heart, and he will not let the people go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.22'>And thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Israel is my son, my firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.23'>I have said to thee: Let my son go, that he may serve me, and thou wouldst not let him go: behold I will kill thy son, thy firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.24'>And when he was in his journey, in the inn, the Lord met him, and would have killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.25'>Immediately Sephora took a very sharp stone, and circumcised the fore skin of her son, and touched his feet and said: A bloody spouse art thou to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.26'>And he let him go after she had said A bloody spouse art thou to me, because of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.27'>And the Lord said to Aaron: Go into the desert to meet Moses. And he went forth to meet him in the mountain of God, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.28'>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord, by which he had sent him, and the signs that he had commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.29'>And they came together, and they assembled all the ancients of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.30'>And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had said to Moses: and he wrought the signs before the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.31'>And the people believed. And they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel: and that he had looked upon their affliction: and falling down they adored.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.5'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.1'>After these things Moses and Aaron went in, and said to Pharao: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Let my people go that they may sacrifice to me in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.2'>But he answered: Who is the Lord, that I should hear his voice, and let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.3'>And they said: The God of the Hebrews hath called us, to go three days' journey into the wilderness and to sacrifice to the Lord our God: lest a pestilence or the sword fall upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.4'>The king of Egypt said to them: Why do you Moses and Aaron draw off the people from their works? Get you gone to your burdens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.5'>And Pharao said: The people of the land is numerous: you see that the multitude is increased: how much more if you give them rest from their works?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.6'>Therefore he commanded the same day the overseers of the works, and the taskmasters of the people, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.7'>You shall give straw no more to the people to make brick, as before: but let them go and gather straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.8'>And you shall lay upon them the task of bricks, which they did before, neither shall you diminish any thing thereof: for they are idle, and therefore they cry, saying: Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.9'>Let them be oppressed, with works, and let them fulfill them: that they may not regard lying words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.10'>And the overseers of the works and the taskmasters went out and said to the people: Thus saith Pharao, I allow you no straw:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.11'>Go, and gather it where you can find it: neither shall any thing of your work be diminished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.12'>And the people was scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.13'>And the overseers of the works pressed them, saying: Fulfill your work every day as before you were wont to do when straw was given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.14'>And they that were over the works of the children of Israel were scourged by Pharao's taskmasters, saying: Why have you not made up the task of bricks both yesterday and to day as before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.15'>And the officers of the children of Israel came, and cried out to Pharao, saying: Why dealest thou so with thy servants?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.16'>Straw is not given us, and bricks are required of us as before: behold we thy servants are beaten with whips, and thy people is unjustly dealt withal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.17'>And he said: You are idle, and therefore you say: Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.18'>Go therefore, and work: straw shall not be given you, and you shall deliver the accustomed number of bricks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.19'>And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in evil case, because it was said to them: There shall not a whit be diminished of the bricks for every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.20'>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood over against them as they came out from Pharao:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.21'>And they said to them: The Lord see and judge, because you have made our savour to stink before Pharao and his servants, and you have given him a sword to kill us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.22'>And Moses returned to the Lord, and said: Lord, why hast thou afflicted this people? wherefore hast thou sent me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.23'>For since the time that I went in to Pharao to speak in thy name, he hath afflicted thy people: and thou hast not delivered them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.6'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.1'>And the Lord said to Moses: Now thou shalt see what I will do to Pharao: for by a mighty hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he cast them out of his land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.34.2'>Be ready in the morning, that thou mayst forthwith go up into mount Sinai, and thou shalt stand with me upon the top of the mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.3'>Let no man go up with thee: and let not any man be seen throughout all the mount: neither let the oxen nor the sheep feed over against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.4'>Then he cut out two tables of stone, such as had been before: and rising very early he went up into the mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, carrying with him the tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.5'>And when the Lord was come down in a cloud, Moses stood with him, calling upon the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.6'>And when he passed before him, he said: O the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, patient and of much compassion, and true,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.7'>Who keepest mercy unto thousands: who takest away iniquity, and wickedness, and sin, and no man of himself is innocent before thee. Who renderest the iniquity of the fathers to the children, and to the grandchildren, unto the third and fourth generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.8'>And Moses making haste, bowed down prostrate unto the earth, and adoring,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.9'>Said: If I have found grace in thy sight: O Lord, I beseech thee, that thou wilt go with us, (for it is a stiffnecked people,) and take away our iniquities and sin, and possess us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.10'>The Lord answered: I will make a covenant in the sight of all. I will do signs such as were never seen upon the earth, nor in any nation: that this people, in the midst of whom thou art, may see the terrible work of the Lord which I will do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.11'>Observe all things which this day I command thee: I myself will drive out before thy face the Amorrhite, and the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.12'>Beware thou never join in friendship with the inhabitants of that land, which may be thy ruin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.13'>But destroy their altars, break their statues, and cut down their groves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.14'>Adore not any strange god. The Lord his name is Jealous, he is a jealous God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.15'>Make no covenant with the men of those countries lest, when they have committed fornication with their gods, and have adored their idols, some one call thee to eat of the things sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.16'>Neither shalt thou take of their daughters a wife for thy son, lest after they themselves have committed fornication, they make thy sons also to commit fornication with their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.17'>Thou shalt not make to thyself any molten gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.18'>Thou shalt keep the feast of the unleavened bread. Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee in the time of the month of the new corn: for in the month of the springtime thou camest out from Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.19'>All of the male kind, that openeth the womb, shall be mine. Of all beasts, both of oxen and of sheep, it shall be mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.20'>The firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a sheep: but if thou wilt not give a price for it, it shall be slain. The firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem: neither shalt thou appear before me empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.21'>Six days shalt thou work, the seventh day thou shalt cease to plough, and to reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.22'>Thou shalt keep the feast of weeks with the firstfruits of the corn of thy wheat harvest, and the feast when the time of the year returneth that all things are laid in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.23'>Three times in a year all thy males shall appear in the sight of the Almighty Lord the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.24'>For when I shall have taken away the nations from thy face, and shall have enlarged thy borders, no man shall lie in wait against thy land when thou shalt go up, and appear in the sight of the Lord thy God thrice in a year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.25'>Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice upon leaven: neither shall there remain in the morning any thing of the victim of the solemnity of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.26'>The first of the fruits of thy ground thou shalt offer in the house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in the milk of his dam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.27'>And the Lord said to Moses: Write these words by which I have made a covenant both with thee and with Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.28'>And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights: he neither ate bread nor drank water, and he wrote upon the tables the ten words of the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.29'>And when Moses came down from the mount Sinai, he held the two tables of the testimony, and he knew not that his face was horned from the conversation of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.30'>And Aaron and the children of Israel seeing the face of Moses horned, were afraid to come near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.31'>And being called by him, they returned, both Aaron and the rulers of the congregation. And after that he spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.32'>And all the children of Israel came to him: and he gave them in commandment all that he had heard of the Lord in mount Sinai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.33'>And having done speaking, he put a veil upon his face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.34'>But when he went in to the Lord, and spoke with him, he took it away until he came forth, and then he spoke to the children of Israel all things that had been commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.34.35'>And they saw that the face of Moses when he came out was horned, but he covered his face again, if at any time he spoke to them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Exod.35'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.35.1'>And all the multitude of the children of Israel being gathered together, he said to them: These are the things which the Lord hath commanded to be done.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Exod.36'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.1'>Beseleel, therefore, and Ooliab, and every wise man, to whom the Lord gave wisdom and understanding, to know how to work artificially, made the things that are necessary for the uses of the sanctuary, and which the Lord commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.2'>And when Moses had called them, and every skilful man, to whom the Lord had given wisdom, and such as of their own accord had offered themselves to the making of the work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.3'>He delivered all the offerings of the children of Israel unto them. And while they were earnest about the work, the people daily in the morning offered their vows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.4'>Whereupon the workmen being constrained to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.5'>Said to Moses: The people offereth more than is necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.6'>Moses therefore commanded proclamation to be made by the crier's voice: Let neither man nor woman offer any more for the work of the sanctuary. And so they ceased from offering gifts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.7'>Because the things that were offered did suffice, and were too much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.8'>And all the men that were wise of heart, to accomplish the work of the tabernacle, made ten curtains of twisted fine linen, and violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, with varied work, and the art of embroidering:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.9'>The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth four: all the curtains were of the same size.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.10'>And he joined five curtains, one to another, and the other five he coupled one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.11'>He made also loops of violet in the edge of the curtain on both sides, and in the edge of the other curtain in like manner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.12'>That the loops might meet on against another, and might be joined each with the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.13'>Whereupon also he cast fifty rings of gold, that might catch the loops of the curtains, and they might be made one tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.14'>He made also eleven curtains of goats' hair, to cover the roof of the tabernacle:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.15'>One curtain was thirty cubits long and four cubits broad: all the curtains were of one measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.16'>Five of which he joined apart, and the other six apart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.17'>And he made fifty loops in the edge of one curtain, and fifty in the edge of another curtain, that they might be joined one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.18'>And fifty buckles of brass wherewith the roof might be knit together, that of all the curtains there might be made one covering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.19'>He made also a cover for the tabernacle of rams' skins dyed red: and another cover over that of violet skins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.20'>He made also the boards of the tabernacle of setim wood standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.21'>The length of one board was ten cubits: and the breadth was one cubit and a half.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.22'>There were two mortises throughout every board, that one might be joined to the other. And in this manner he made for all the boards of the tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.23'>Of which twenty were at the south side southward,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.24'>With forty sockets of silver, two sockets were put under one board on the two sides of the corners, where the mortises of the sides end in the corners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.25'>At that side also of the tabernacle, that looketh toward the north, he made twenty boards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.26'>With forty sockets of silver, two sockets for every board.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.27'>But against the west, to wit, at that side of the tabernacle, which looketh to the sea, he made six boards,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.28'>And two others at each corner of the tabernacle behind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.29'>Which were also joined from beneath unto the top, and went together into one joint. Thus he did on both sides at the corners:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.30'>So there were in all eight boards and they had sixteen sockets of silver, to wit, two sockets under every board.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.31'>He made also bars of setim wood, five to hold together the boards of one side of the tabernacle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.32'>And five others to join together the boards of the other side: and besides these, five other bars at the west side of the tabernacle towards the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.33'>He made also another bar, that might come by the midst of the boards from corner to corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.34'>And the board works themselves he overlaid with gold, casting for them sockets of silver. And their rings he made of gold, through which the bars might be drawn: and he covered the bars themselves with plates of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.35'>He made also a veil of violet, and purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen, varied and distinguished with embroidery:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.36'>And four pillars of setim wood, which with their heads be overlaid with gold, casting for them sockets of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.37'>He made also a hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen, with the work of an embroiderer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.36.38'>And five pillars with their heads, which he covered with gold, and their sockets he cast of brass.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.37'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.1'>And Beseleel made also the ark of setim wood: it was two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth, and the height was of one cubit and a half: and he overlaid it with the purest gold within and without.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.2'>And he made to it a crown of gold round about,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.3'>Casting four rings of gold at the four corners thereof: two rings in one side, and two in the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.4'>And he made bars of setim wood, which he overlaid with gold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.5'>And he put them into the rings that were at the sides of the ark to carry it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.6'>He made also the propitiatory, that is, the oracle, of the purest gold, two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.7'>Two cherubims also of beaten gold, which he set on the two sides of the propitiatory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.8'>One cherub in the top of one side, and the other cherub in the top of the other side: two cherubims at the two ends of the propitiatory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.9'>Spreading their wings, and covering the propitiatory, and looking one towards the other, and towards it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.10'>He made also the table of setim wood, in length two cubits, and in breadth one cubit, and in height it was a cubit and a half.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.11'>And he overlaid it with the finest gold, and he made to it a golden ledge round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.12'>And to the ledge itself he made a polished crown of gold, of four fingers' breadth, and upon the same another golden crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.13'>And he cast four rings of gold, which he put in the four corners at each foot of the table,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.14'>Over against the crown: and he put the bars into them, that the table might be carried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.15'>And the bars also themselves he made of setim wood, and overlaid them with gold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.16'>And the vessels for the divers uses of the table, dishes, bowls, and cups, and censers of pure gold, wherein the libations are to be offered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.17'>He made also the candlestick of beaten work of the finest gold. From the shaft whereof its branches, its cups, and bowls, and lilies came out:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.37.19'>Three cups in manner of a nut on each branch, and bowls withal and lilies; and three cups of the fashion of a nut in another branch, and bowls withal and lilies. The work of the six branches that went out from the shaft of the candlestick was equal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.20'>And in the shaft itself were four cups after the manner of a nut, and bowls withal at every one, and lilies:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.21'>And bowls under two branches in three places, which together make six branches going out from one shaft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.22'>So both the bowls, and the branches were of the same, all beaten work of the purest gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.23'>He made also the seven lamps with their snuffers, and the vessels where the snuffings were to be put out, of the purest gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.24'>The candlestick with all the vessels thereof weighed a talent of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.25'>He made also the altar of incense of setim wood, being a cubit on every side foursquare, and in height two cubits: from the corners of which went out horns.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.37.27'>And he made to it a crown of gold round about, and two golden rings under the crown at each side, that the bars might be put into them, and the altar be carried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.28'>And the bars themselves he made also of setim wood, and overlaid them with plates of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.37.29'>He compounded also the oil for the ointment of sanctification, and incense of the purest spices, according to the work of a perfumer.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.38.3'>And for the uses thereof, he prepared divers vessels of brass, cauldrons, tongs, fleshhooks, pothooks, and firepans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.38.4'>And he made the grate thereof of brass, in manner of a net, and under it in the midst of the altar a hearth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.38.5'>Casting four rings at the four ends of the net at the top, to put in bars to carry it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.38.6'>And he made the bars of setim wood, and overlaid them with plates of brass:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.38.7'>And he drew them through the rings that stood out in the sides of the altar. And the altar itself was not solid, but hollow, of boards, and empty within.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.38.8'>He made also the laver of brass, with the foot thereof, of the mirrors of the women that watch at the door of the tabernacle.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.38.12'>But on that side that looketh to the west, there were hangings of fifty cubits, ten pillars of brass with their sockets, and the heads of the pillars, and all the graving of the work, of silver.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.38.15'>And on the other side (for between the two he made the entry of the tabernacle) there were hangings equally of fifteen cubits, and three pillars, and as many sockets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.38.16'>All the hangings of the court were woven with twisted linen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.38.17'>The sockets of the pillars were of brass, and their heads with all their gravings of silver: and he overlaid the pillars of the court also with silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.38.18'>And he made in the entry thereof an embroidered hanging of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen, that was twenty cubits long, and five cubits high according to the measure of all the hangings of the court.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.38.20'>The pins also of the tabernacle and of the court round about he made of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.38.21'>These are the instruments of the tabernacle of the testimony, which were counted according to the commandment of Moses, in the ceremonies of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.38.22'>Which Beseleel the son of Uri the son of Hur of the tribe of Juda had made as the Lord commanded by Moses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.38.23'>Having for his companion Ooliab the son of Achisamech of the tribe of Dan: who also was an excellent artificer in wood, and worker in tapestry and embroidery in violet, purple, scarlet, and fine linen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.38.24'>All the gold that was spent in the work of the sanctuary, and that was offered in gifts was nine and twenty talents, and seven hundred and thirty sicles according to the standard of the sanctuary.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.38.26'>There were moreover a hundred talents of silver, whereof were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and of the entry where the veil hangeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.38.27'>A hundred sockets were made of a hundred talents, one talent being reckoned for every socket.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.38.28'>And of the thousand seven hundred and seventy-five he made the heads of the pillars, which also he overlaid with silver.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.38.30'>Of which were cast the sockets in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony, and the altar of brass with the grate thereof, and all the vessels that belong to the use thereof.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.39'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.1'>And he made, of violet and purple, scarlet and fine linen, the vestments for Aaron to wear when he ministered in the holy places, as the Lord commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.2'>So he made an ephod of gold, violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.3'>With embroidered work: and he cut thin plates of gold, and drew them small into threads, that they might be twisted with the woof of the aforesaid colours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.4'>And two borders coupled one to the other in the top on either side,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.5'>And a girdle of the same colours, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.6'>He prepared also two onyx stones, fast set and closed in gold, and graven by the art of a lapidary, with the names of the children of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.7'>And he set them in the sides of the ephod for a memorial of the children of Israel, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.8'>He made also a rational with embroidered work, according to the work of the ephod, of gold, violet, purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.9'>Foursquare, double, of the measure of a span.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.10'>And he set four rows of precious stones in it. In the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.11'>In the second, a carbuncle, a sapphire, and a jasper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.12'>In the third, a ligurius, an agate, and an amethyst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.13'>In the fourth, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a beryl, set and enclosed in gold by their rows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.14'>And the twelve stones were engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, each one with its several name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.15'>They made also in the rational little chains linked one to another of the purest gold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.16'>And two hooks, and as many rings of gold. And they set the rings on either side of the rational,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.17'>On which rings the two golden chains should hang, which they put into the hooks that stood out in the corners of the ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.18'>These both before and behind so answered one another, that the ephod and the rational were bound together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.19'>Being fastened to the girdle and strongly coupled with rings, which a violet fillet joined, lest they should flag loose, and be moved one from the other, as the Lord commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.20'>They made also the tunick of the ephod all of violet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.21'>And a hole for the head in the upper part at the middle, and a woven border round about the hole:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.22'>And beneath at the feet pomegranates of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.23'>And little bells of the purest gold, which they put between the pomegranates at the bottom of the tunick round about:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.24'>To wit, a bell of gold, and a pomegranate, wherewith the high priest went adorned, when he discharged his ministry, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.25'>They made also fine linen tunicks with woven work for Aaron and his sons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.26'>And mitres with their little crowns of fine linen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.27'>And linen breeches of fine linen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.28'>And a girdle of fine twisted linen, violet, purple, and scarlet twice dyed, of embroidery work, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.29'>They made also the plate of sacred veneration of the purest gold, and they wrote on it with the engraving of a lapidary, The Holy of the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.30'>And they fastened it to the mitre with a violet fillet, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.31'>So all the work of the tabernacle and of the roof of the testimony was finished: and the children of Israel did all things which the Lord had commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.32'>And they offered the tabernacle and the roof and the whole furniture, the rings, the boards, the bars, the pillars, and their sockets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.33'>The cover of rams' skins dyed red, and the other cover of violet skins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.34'>The veil, the ark, the bars, the propitiatory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.35'>The table, with the vessels thereof, and the loaves of proposition:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.36'>The candlestick, the lamps, and the furniture of them with the oil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.37'>The altar of gold, and the ointment, and the incense of spices:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.38'>And the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.39'>The altar of brass, the grate, the bars, and all the vessels thereof: the laver with the foot thereof: the hangings of the court, and the pillars with their sockets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.40'>The hanging in the entry of the court, and the little cords, and the pins thereof. Nothing was wanting of the vessels, that were commanded to be made for the ministry of the tabernacle, and for the roof of the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.41'>The vestments also, which the priests, to wit, Aaron and his sons, used in the sanctuary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.42'>The children of Israel offered as the Lord had commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.39.43'>And when Moses saw all things finished, he blessed them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Exod.40'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.1'>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.2'>The first month, the first day of the month, thou shalt set up the tabernacle of the testimony,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.3'>And shalt put the ark in it, and shalt let down the veil before it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.4'>And thou shalt bring in the table, and set upon it the things that are commanded according to the rite. The candlestick shall stand with its lamps,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.5'>And the altar of gold whereon the incense is burnt, before the ark of the testimony. Thou shalt put the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.6'>And before it the altar of holocaust:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.7'>The laver between the altar and the tabernacle, and thou shalt fill it with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.8'>And thou shalt encompass the court with hangings, and the entry thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.9'>And thou shalt take the oil of unction and anoint the tabernacle with its vessels, that they may be sanctified:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.10'>The altar of holocaust and all its vessels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.11'>The laver with its foot: thou shalt consecrate all with the oil of unction, that they may be most holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.12'>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and having washed them with water,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.13'>Thou shalt put on them the holy vestments, that they may minister to me, and that the unction of them may prosper to an everlasting priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.14'>And Moses did all that the Lord had commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.15'>So in the first month of the second year, the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.16'>And Moses reared it up, and placed the boards and the sockets and the bars, and set up the pillars,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.17'>And spread the roof over the tabernacle, putting over it a cover, as the Lord had commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.18'>And he put the testimony in the ark, thrusting bars underneath, and the oracle above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.19'>And when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle, he drew the veil before it to fulfil the commandment of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.20'>And he set the table in the tabernacle of the testimony at the north side without the veil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.21'>Setting there in order the loaves of proposition, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.22'>He set the candlestick also in the tabernacle of the testimony over against the table on the south side,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.40.24'>He set also the altar of gold under the roof of the testimony over against the veil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.25'>And burnt upon it the incense of spices, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.26'>And he put also the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.27'>And the altar of holocaust of the entry of the testimony, offering the holocaust, and the sacrifices upon it, as the Lord had commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.28'>And he set the laver between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar, filling it with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.29'>And Moses and Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.40.31'>He set up also the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, drawing the hanging in the entry thereof. After all things were perfected,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.32'>The cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony, and the glory of the Lord filled it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.33'>Neither could Moses go into the tabernacle of the covenant, the cloud covering all things and the majesty of the Lord shining, for the cloud had covered all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.34'>If at any time the cloud removed from the tabernacle, the children of Israel went forward by their troops:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.35'>If it hung over, they remained in the same place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.36'>For the cloud of the Lord hung over the tabernacle by day, and a fire by night, in the sight of all the children of Israel throughout all their mansions.</verse>
