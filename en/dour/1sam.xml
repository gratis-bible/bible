      <chapter osisID='1Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>There was a man of Ramathaimsophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elcana, the son of Jeroham, the son of Eliu, the son of Thohu, the son of Suph, an Ephraimite:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>And he had two wives, the name of one was Anna, and the name of the other Phenenna. Phenenna had children: but Anna had no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>And this man went up out of his city upon the appointed days, to adore and to offer sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Silo. And the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were there priests of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>Now the day came, and Elcana offered sacrifice, and gave to Phenenna his wife, and to all her sons and daughters, portions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>But to Anna he gave one portion with sorrow, because he loved Anna. And the Lord had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>Her rival also afflicted her, and troubled her exceedingly, insomuch that she upbraided her, that the Lord had shut up her womb:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>And thus she did every year, when the time returned that they went up to the temple of the Lord: and thus she provoked her: but Anna wept, and did not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>Then Elcana her husband said to her: Anna, why weepest thou? and why dost thou not eat? And why dost thou afflict thy heart? Am not I better to thee than ten children?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>So Anna arose after she had eaten and drunk in Silo: And Heli the priest sitting upon a stool, before the door of the temple of the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>As Anna had her heart full of grief, she prayed to the Lord, shedding many tears,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>And she made a vow, saying: O Lord, of hosts, if thou wilt look down on the affliction of thy servant, and wilt be mindful of me, and not forget thy handmaid, and wilt give to thy servant a man child: I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>And it came to pass, as she multiplied prayers before the Lord, that Heli observed her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>Now Anna spoke in her heart, and only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard at all. Heli therefore thought her to be drunk,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>And said to her: How long wilt thou, be drunk? digest a little the wine, of which thou hast taken too much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>Anna answering, said: Not so, my lord: for I am an exceeding unhappy woman, and have drunk neither wine nor any strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>Count not thy handmaid for one of the daughters of Belial: for out of the abundance of my sorrow and grief have I spoken till now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>Then Heli said to her: Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition, which thou hast asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>And she said: Would to God thy handmaid may find grace in thy eyes. So the woman went on her way, and ate, and her countenance was no more changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>And they rose in the morning, and worshipped before the Lord: and they returned, and came into their house at Ramatha. And Elcana knew Anna his wife: and the Lord remembered her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>And it came to pass when the time was come about, Anna conceived and bore a son, and called his name Samuel: because she had asked him of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>And Elcana her husband went up, and all his house, to offer to the Lord the solemn sacrifice, and his vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>But Anna went not up: for she said to her husband: I will not go till the child be weaned, and till I may carry him, that he may appear before the Lord, and may abide always there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>And Elcana her husband said to her: Do what seemeth good to thee, and stay till thou wean him: and I pray that the Lord may fulfil his word. So the woman stayed at home, and gave her son suck, till she weaned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>And after she had weaned him, she carried him with her, with three calves, and three bushels of flour, and a bottle of wine, and she brought him to the house of the Lord in Silo. Now the child was as yet very young:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>And they immolated a calf, and offered the child to Heli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>And Anna said: I beseech thee, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord: I am that woman who stood before thee here praying to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>For this child did I pray, and the Lord hath granted me my petition, which I asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord all the days of his life, he shall be lent to the Lord. And they adored the Lord there. And Anna prayed, and said:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>My heart hath rejoiced in the Lord, and my horn is exalted in my God: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies: because I have joyed in thy salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>There is none holy as the Lord is: for there is no other beside thee, and there is none strong like our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>Do not multiply to speak lofty things, boasting: let old matters depart from your mouth: for the Lord is a God of all knowledge, and to him are thoughts prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>The bow of the mighty is overcome, and the weak are girt with strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>They that were full before have hired out themselves for bread: and the hungry are filled, so that the barren hath borne many: and she that had many children is weakened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>The Lord killeth and maketh alive, he bringeth down to hell and bringeth back again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich, he humbleth and he exalteth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>He raiseth up the needy from the dust, and lifteth up the poor from the dunghill: that he may sit with princes, and hold the throne of glory. For the poles of the earth are the Lord's, and upon them he hath set the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness, because no man shall prevail by his own strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>The adversaries of the Lord shall fear him: and upon them shall he thunder in the heavens. The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth, and he shall give empire to his king, and shall exalt the horn of his Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>And Elcana went to Ramatha, to his house: but the child ministered in the sight of the Lord before the face of Heli the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>Now the sons of Heli were children of Belial, not knowing the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>Nor the office of the priests to the people: but whosoever had offered a sacrifice, the servant of the priest came, while the flesh was in boiling, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>And thrust it into the kettle, or into the caldron, or into the pot, or into the pan: and all that the fleshhook brought up, the priest took to himself. Thus did they to all Israel that came to Silo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>Also before they burnt the fat, the servant of the priest came, and said to the man that sacrificed: Give me flesh to boil for the priest: for I will not take of thee sodden flesh, but raw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>And he that sacrificed said to him: Let the fat first be burnt to day according to the custom, and then take as much as thy soul desireth. But he answered and said to him: Not so: but thou shalt give it me now, or else I will take it by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>Wherefore the sin of the young men was exceeding great before the Lord: because they withdrew men from the sacrifice of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>But Samuel ministered before the face of the Lord: being a child girded with a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>And his mother made him a little coat, which she brought to him on the appointed days, when she went up with her husband, to offer the solemn sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>And Heli blessed Elcana and his wife: and he said to him: The Lord give thee seed of this woman, for the loan thou hast lent to the Lord. And they went to their own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>And the Lord visited Anna, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters: and the child Samuel became great before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>Now Heli was very old, and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel: and how they lay with the women that waited at the door of the tabernacle:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>And he said to them: Why do ye these kinds of things, which I hear, very wicked things, from all the people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>Do not so, my sons: for it is no good report that I hear, that you make the people of the Lord to transgress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>If one man shall sin against another, God may be appeased in his behalf: but if a man shall sin against the Lord, who shall pray for him? And they hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>But the child Samuel advanced, and grew on, and pleased both the Lord and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>And there came a man of God to Heli, and said to him: Thus saith the Lord: Did I not plainly appear to thy father's house, when they were in Egypt in the house of Pharao?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my sitar, and burn incense to me, and to wear the ephod before me: and I gave to thy father's house of all the sacrifices of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>Why have you kicked away my victims, and my gifts which I commanded to be offered in the temple: and thou hast rather honoured thy sons than me, to eat the firstfruits of every sacrifice of my people Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>Wherefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father should minister in my sight, for ever. But now saith the Lord: Far be this from me: but whosoever shall glorify me, him will I glorify: but they that despise me, shall be despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Behold the days come: and I will cut off thy arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>And thou shalt see thy rival in the temple, in all the prosperity of Israel, and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>However I will not altogether take away a man of thee from my altar: but that thy eyes may faint and thy soul be spent: and a great part of thy house shall die when they come to man's estate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>And this shall be a sign to thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, Ophni and Phinees: In one day they shall both of them die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>And I will raise me up a faithful priest, who shall do according to my heart, and my soul, and I will build him a faithful house, and he shall walk all days before my anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall remain in thy house, shall come that he may be prayed for, and shall offer a piece of silver, and a roll of bread, and shall say: Put me, I beseech thee, to somewhat of the priestly office, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>Now the child Samuel ministered to the Lord before Heli, and the word of the Lord was precious in those days, there was no manifest vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.2'>And it came to pass one day when Heli lay in his place, and his eyes were grown dim, that he could not see:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.3'>Before the lamp of God went out, Samuel slept in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.4'>And the Lord called Samuel. And he answered: Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.5'>And he ran to Heli and said: Here am I: for thou didst call me. He said: I did not call: go back and sleep. And he went and slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.6'>And the Lord called Samuel again. And Samuel arose and went to Heli, and said: Here am I: for thou calledst me. He answered: I did not call thee, my son: return and sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.7'>Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither had the word of the Lord been revealed to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.8'>And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose up and went to Heli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.9'>And said: Here am I: for thou didst call me. Then Heli understood that the Lord called the child, and he said to Samuel: Go, and sleep: and if he shall call thee any more, thou shalt say: Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and slept in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.10'>And the Lord came and stood: and he called, as he had called the other times: Samuel, Samuel. And Samuel said: Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.11'>And the Lord said to Samuel: Behold I do a thing in Israel: and whosoever shall hear it, both his ears shall tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.12'>In that day I will raise up against Heli all the things I have spoken concerning his house: I will begin, and I will make an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.13'>For I have foretold unto him, that I will judge his house for ever, for iniquity, because he knew that his sons did wickedly, and did not chastise them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.14'>Therefore have I sworn to the house of Hell, that the iniquity of his house shall not be expiated with victims nor offerings for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.15'>And Samuel slept till morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord. And Samuel feared to tell the vision to Hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.16'>Then Heli called Samuel, and said: Samuel, my son. And he answered: Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.17'>And he asked him: What is the word that the Lord hath spoken to thee? I beseech thee hide it not from me. May God do so and so to thee, and add so and so, if thou hide from me one word of all that were said to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.18'>So Samuel told him all the words, and did not hide them from him. And he answered: It is the Lord: let him do what is good in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.19'>And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and not one of his words fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.20'>And all Israel from Dan to Bersabee, knew that Samuel was a faithful prophet of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.21'>And the Lord again appeared in Silo, for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Silo, according to the word of the Lord. And the word of Samuel came to pass to all Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.1'>And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight: and Israel went out to war against the Philistines, and camped by the Stone of help. And the Philistines came to Aphec,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.2'>And put their army in array against Israel. And when they had joined battle, Israel turned their backs to the Philistines, and there was slain in that fight here and there in the fields about four thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.3'>And the people returned to the camp: and the ancients of Israel said: Why hath the Lord defeated us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch unto us the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Silo, and let it come in the midst of us, that it may save us from the hand of our enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.4'>So the people sent to Silo, and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts sitting upon the cherubims: and the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were with the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.5'>And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord was come into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, and the earth rang again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.6'>And the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, and they said: What is this noise of a great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.7'>And the Philistines were afraid, saying: God is come into the camp. And sighing, they said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.8'>Woe to us: for there was no such great joy yesterday and the day before: Woe to us. Who shall deliver us from the hand of these high gods? these are the gods that struck Egypt with all the plagues in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.9'>Take courage and behave like men, ye Philistines: lest you come to be servants to the Hebrews, as they have served you: take courage and fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.10'>So the Philistines fought, and Israel was overthrown, and every man fled to his own dwelling: and there was an exceeding great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.11'>And the ark of God was taken: and the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.12'>And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Silo the same day, with his clothes rent, and his head strewed with dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.13'>And when he was come, Heli sat upon a stool over against the way watching. For his heart was fearful for the ark of God. And when the man was come into the city, he told it: and all the city cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.14'>And Heli heard the noise of the cry, and he said: What meaneth the noise of this uproar? But he made haste, and came, and told Heli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.15'>Now Heli was ninety and eight years old, and his eyes were dim, and he could not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.16'>And he said to Heli: I am he that came from the battle, and have fled out of the field this day. And he said to him: What is there done, my son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.17'>And he that brought the news answered, and said: Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter of the people: moreover thy two sons, Ophni and Phinees, are dead: and the ark of God is taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.18'>And when he had named the ark of God, he fell from his stool backwards by the door, and broke his neck, and died. For he was an old man, and far advanced in years: and he judged Israel forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.19'>And his daughter in law the wife of Phinees, was big with child, and near her time: and hearing the news that the ark of God was taken, and her father in law, and her husband, were dead, she bowed herself and fell in labour: for her pains came upon her on a sudden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.20'>And when she was upon the point of death, they that stood about her said to her: Fear not, for thou hast borne a son. She answered them not, nor gave heed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.21'>And she called the child Ichabod, saying: The glory is gone from Israel, because the ark of God was taken, and for her father in law, and her husband:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.22'>And she said: The glory is departed from Israel, because the ark of God was taken.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.1'>And the Philistines took the ark of God, and carried it from the Stone of help into Azotus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.2'>And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the temple of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.3'>And when the Azotians arose early the next day, behold Dagon lay upon his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord: and they took Dagon, and set him again in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.4'>And the next day again, when they rose in the morning, they found Dagon lying upon his face on the earth before the ark of the Lord: and the head of Dagon, and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.5'>And only the stump of Dagon remained in its place. For this cause neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that go into the temple tread on the threshold of Dagon in Azotus unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.6'>And the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Azotians, and he destroyed them, and afflicted Azotus and the coasts thereof with emerods. And in the villages and fields in the midst of that country, there came forth a multitude of mice, and there was the confusion of a great mortality in the city.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.3'>And the asses of Cis, Sauls father, were lost: and Cis said to his son Saul: Take one of the servants with thee, and arise, go, and seek the asses. And when they had passed through mount Ephraim,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.3'>And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines which was in Gabaa. And when the Philistines had heard of it, Saul sounded the trumpet over all the land, saying: Let the Hebrews hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.4'>And all Israel heard this report: Saul hath smitten the garrison of the Philistines: and Israel took courage against the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Galgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.5'>The Philistines also were assembled to fight against Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and a multitude of people besides, like the sand on the sea shore for number. And going up they camped in Machmas at the east of Bethaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.6'>And when the men of Israel saw that they were straitened, (for the people were distressed,) they hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in dens, and in pits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.7'>And some of the Hebrews passed over the Jordan into the land of Gad and Galaad. And when Saul was yet in Galgal, all the people that followed him were greatly afraid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.12'>I said: Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Galgal, and I have not appeased the face of the Lord. Forced by necessity, I offered the holocaust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.13'>And Samuel said to Saul: Thou hast done foolishly, and hast not kept the commandments of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee. And if thou hadst not done thus, the Lord would now have established thy kingdom over Israel for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.14'>But thy kingdom shall not continue. The Lord hath sought him a man according to his own heart: and him hath the Lord commanded to be prince over his people, because thou hast not observed that which the Lord commanded.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.4'>Now there were between the ascents, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the garrison of the Philistines, rocks standing up on both sides, and steep cliffs like teeth on the one side, and on the other, the name of the one was Boses, and the name of the other was Sene:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.5'>One rock stood out towards the north over against Machmas, and the other to the south over against Gabaa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.6'>And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour: Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised, it may be the Lord will do for us, because it is easy for the Lord to save either by many, or by few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.7'>And his armourbearer said to him: Do all that pleaseth thy mind: go whither thou wilt, and I will be with thee wheresoever thou hast a mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.8'>And Jonathan said: Behold we will go over to these men. And when we shall be seen by them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.9'>If they shall speak thus to us: Stay till we come to you: let us stand still in our place, and not go up to them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.11'>So both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said: Behold the Hebrews come forth out of the holes wherein they were hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.12'>And the men of the garrison spoke to Jonathan, and to his armourbearer, and said: Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said to his armourbearer: Let us go up, follow me: for the Lord hath delivered them into the hands of I srael.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.13'>And Jonathan went up creeping on his hands and feet, and his armourbearer after him. And some fell before Jonathan, others his armourbearer slew as he followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.14'>And the first slaughter which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was of about twenty men, within half an acre of land, which a yoke of oxen is wont to plough in a day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.15'>And there was a miracle in the camp, through the fields: yea and all the people of their garrison, who had gone out to plunder, were amazed, and the earth trembled: and it happened as a miracle from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.16'>And the watchmen of Saul, who were in Gabaa of Benjamin looked, and behold a multitude overthrown, and fleeing this way and that.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.19'>And while Saul spoke to the priest, there arose a great uproar in the camp of the Philistines: and it increased by degrees, and was heard more clearly. And Saul said to the priest: Draw in thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.20'>Then Saul and all the people that were with him, shouted together, and they came to the place of the fight: and behold every man's sword was turned upon his neighbour, and there was a very great slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.21'>Moreover the Hebrews that had been with the Philistines yesterday and the day before, and went up with them into the camp, returned to be with the Israelites, who were with Saul and Jonathan.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.24'>And the men of Israel were joined together that day; and Saul adjured the people, saying: Cursed be the man that shall eat food till evening, till I be revenged of my enemies. So none of the people tasted any food:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.25'>And all the common people came into a forest, in which there was honey upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.26'>And when the people came into the forest, behold the honey dropped, but no man put his hand to his mouth. For the people feared the oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.27'>But Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people: and he put forth the end of the rod, which he had in his hand, and dipt it in a honeycomb: and he carried his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were enlightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.28'>And one of the people answering, said: Thy father hath bound the people with an oath, saying: Cursed be the man that shall eat any food this day. (And the people were faint.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.29'>And Jonathan said: My father hath troubled the land: you have seen yourselves that my eyes are enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.30'>How much more if the people had eaten of the prey of their enemies, which they found? had there not been made a greater slaughter among the Philistines?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.32'>And falling upon the spoils, they took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people ate them with the blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.33'>And they told Saul that the people had sinned against the Lord, eating with the blood. And he said: You have transgressed: roll here to me now a great stone.</verse>

So all the people brought every man his ox with him till the night: and slew them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.35'>And Saul built an altar to the Lord and he then first began to build an altar to the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.41'>And Saul said to the Lord: O Lord God of Israel, give a sign, by which we may know, what the meaning is, that thou answerest not thy servant to day. If this iniquity be in me, or in my son Jonathan, give a proof: or if this iniquity be in thy people, give holiness. And Jonathan and Saul were taken, and the people escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.42'>And Saul said: Cast lots between me, and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.46'>And Saul went back, and did not pursue after the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own places.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.15'>And Saul said: They have brought them from Amalec: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the herds that they might be sacrificed to the Lord thy God, but the rest we have slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.16'>And Samuel said to Saul: Suffer me, and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night. And he said to him: Speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.17'>And Samuel said: When thou wast a little one in thy own eyes, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And the Lord anointed thee to be king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.18'>And the Lord sent thee on the way, and said: Go, and kill the sinners of Amalec, and thou shalt fight against them until thou hast utterly destroyed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.19'>Why then didst thou not hearken to the voice of the Lord: but hast turned to the prey, and hast done evil in the eyes of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.20'>And Saul said to Samuel: Yea I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord, and have walked in the way by which the Lord sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalec, and Amalec I have slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.21'>But the people took of the spoils sheep and oxen, as the firstfruits of those things that were slain, to offer sacrifice to the Lord their God in Galgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.22'>And Samuel said: Doth the Lord desire holocausts and victims, and not rather that the voice of the Lord should be obeyed? For obedience is better than sacrifices: and to hearken rather than to offer the fat of rams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.23'>Because it is like the sin of witchcraft, to rebel: and like the crime of idolatry, to refuse to obey. Forasmuch therefore as thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord hath also rejected thee from being king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.24'>And Saul said to Samuel: I have sinned because I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words, fearing the people, and obeying their voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.25'>But now bear, I beseech thee, my sin, and return with me, that I may adore the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.26'>And Samuel said to Saul: I will not return with thee, because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.27'>And Samuel turned about to go away: but he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.28'>And Samuel said to him: The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to thy neighbour who is better than thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.29'>But the triumpher in Israel will riot spare, and will not be moved to repentance: for he is not a mail that he should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.30'>Then he said: I have sinned: yet honour me now before the ancients of my people, and before Israel, and return with me, that I may adore the Lord thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.31'>So Samuel turned again after Saul: and Saul adored the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.32'>And Samuel said: Bring hitherto me Agag the king of Amalec. And Agag was presented to him very fat, and trembling. And Agag said: Doth bitter death separate in this manner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.33'>And Samuel said: As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed him in pieces before the Lord in Galgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.34'>And Samuel departed to Ramatha: but Saul went up to his house in Gabaa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.35'>And Samuel saw Saul no more till the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul, because the Lord repented that he had made him king over Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.1'>And the Lord said to Samuel. How It long wilt thou mourn for Saul, whom I have rejected from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and come, that I may send thee to Isai the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.2'>And Samuel said: How shall I go? for Saul will hear of it, and he will kill me. And the Lord said: Thou shalt take with thee a calf of the herd, and thou shalt say: I am come to sacrifice to the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.10'>Isai therefore brought his seven sons before Samuel: and Samuel said to Isai: The Lord hath not chosen any one of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.11'>And Samuel said to Isai: Are here all thy sons? He answered: There remaineth yet a young one, who keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said to Isai: Send, and fetch him, for we will not sit down till he come hither.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.18'>And one of the servants answering, said: Behold I have seen a son of Isai the Bethlehemite, a skilful player, and one of great strength, and a man fit for war, and prudent in his words, and a comely person: and the Lord is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.19'>Then Saul sent messengers to Isai, saying: Send me David thy son, who is in the pastures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.20'>And Isai took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid of the flock, and sent them by the hand of David his son to Saul.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.1'>Now the Philistines gathering together their troops to battle, assembled at Socho of Juda, and camped between Socho and Azeca in the borders of Dommim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.2'>And Saul and the children of Israel being gathered together came to the valley of Terebinth, and they set the army in array to fight against the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.3'>And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.4'>And there went out a man baseborn from the camp of the Philistines named Goliath, of Geth, whose height was six cubits and a span:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.5'>And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clothed with a coat of mail with scales, and the weight of his coat of mail was five thousand sicles of brass:</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.7'>And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the head of his spear weighed six hundred sicles of iron: and his armourbearer went before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.8'>And standing he cried out to the bands of Israel, and said to them: Why are you come out prepared to fight? am not I a Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Choose out a man of you, and let him come down and fight hand to hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.9'>If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, we will be servants to you: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, you shall be servants, and shall serve us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.10'>And the Philistine said: I have defied the bands of Israel this day: Give me a man, and let him fight with me hand to hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.11'>And Saul and all the Israelites hearing these words of the Philistine were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.12'>Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Juda before mentioned, whose name was Isai, who had eight sons, and was an old man in the days of Saul, and of great age among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.13'>And his three eldest sons followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle, were Eliab the firstborn, and the second Abinadab, and the third Samma.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.14'>But David was the youngest. So the three eldest having followed Saul,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.17'>And Isai said to David his son: Take for thy brethren an ephi of frumenty, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren.</verse>

I know thy pride, and the wickedness of thy heart: that thou art come down to see the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.29'>And David said: What have I done? is there not cause to speak?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.30'>And he turned a little aside from him to another: and said the same word. And the people answered him as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.31'>And the words which David spoke were heard, and were rehearsed before Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.32'>And when he was brought to him, he said to him: Let not any man's heart be dismayed in him: I thy servant will go, and will fight against the Philistine.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.34'>And David said to Saul: Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, or a bear, and took a ram out of the midst of the flock:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.35'>And I pursued after them, and struck them, and delivered it out of their mouth: and they rose up against me, and I caught them by the throat, and I strangled and killed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.36'>For I thy servant have killed both a lion and a bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be also as one of them.

        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.37'>And David said: The Lord who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David: Go, and the Lord be with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.38'>And Saul clothed David with his garments, and put a helmet of brass upon his head, and armed him with a coat of mail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.39'>And David having girded his sword upon his armour, began to try if he could walk in armour: for he was not accustomed to it. And David said to Saul: I cannot go thus, for I am not used to it. And he laid them off,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.40'>And he took his staff, which he had always in his hands: and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them into the shepherd's scrip, which he had with him, and he took a sling in his hand, and went forth against the Philistine.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.42'>And when the Philistine looked, and beheld David, he despised him. For he was a young man, ruddy, and of a comely countenance.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.47'>And all this assembly shall know, that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for it is his battle, and he will deliver you into our hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.48'>And when the Philistine arose and was coming, and drew nigh to meet David, David made haste, and ran to the fight to meet the Philistine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.49'>And he put his hand into his scrip, and took a stone, and cast it with the sling, and fetching it about struck the Philistine in the forehead: and the stone was fixed in his forehead, and he fell on his face upon the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.51'>He ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head. And the Philistines seeing that their champion was dead, fled away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.52'>And the men of Israel and Juda rising up shouted, and pursued after the Philistines till they came to the valley and to the gates of Accaron, and there fell many wounded of the Philistines in the way of Saraim, and as far as Geth, and as far as Accaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.53'>And the children of Israel returning, after they had pursued the Philistines, fell upon their camp.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.28'>And Saul saw, and understood that the Lord was with David. And Michol the daughter of Saul loved him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.30'>And the princes of the Philistines went forth: and from the beginning of their going forth, David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul, and his name became very famous.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.19'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.1'>And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan the son of Saul loved David exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.2'>And Jonathan told David, saying: Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: wherefore look to thyself, I beseech thee, in the morning, and thou shalt abide in a secret place and shalt be hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.3'>And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art: and I will speak of thee to my father, and whatsoever I shall see, I will tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.4'>And Jonathan spoke good things of David to Saul his father: and said to him: Sin not, O king, against thy servant, David, because he hath not sinned against thee, and his works are very good towards thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.5'>And he put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the Lord wrought great salvation for all Israel. Thou sawest it and didst rejoice. Why therefore wilt thou sin against innocent blood by killing David, who is without fault?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.6'>And when Saul heard this he was appeased with the words of Jonathan, and swore: As the Lord liveth he shall not be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.7'>Then Jonathan called David and told him all these words: and Jonathan brought in David to Saul, and he was before him, as he had been yesterday and the day before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.8'>And the war began again, and David went out and fought against the Philistines, and defeated them with a great slaughter, and they fled from his face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.9'>And the evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul, and he sat in his house, and held a spear in his hand: and David played with his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.10'>And Saul endeavoured to nail David to the wall with his spear. And David slipt away out of the presence of Saul: and the spear missed him, and was fastened in the wall, and David fled and escaped that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.11'>Saul therefore sent his guards to David's house to watch him, that he might be killed in the morning. And when Michol David's wife had told him this, saying: Unless thou save thyself this night, to morrow thou wilt die,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.12'>She let him down through a window. And he went and fled away and escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.13'>And Michol took an image and laid it on the bed, and put a goat's skin with the hair at the head of it, and covered it with clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.14'>And Saul sent officers to seize David: and it was answered that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.15'>And again Saul sent to see David, saying: Bring him to me in the bed, that he may be slain.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.18'>But David fled and escaped, and came to Samuel in Ramatha, and told him all that Saul had done to him: and he and Samuel went and dwelt in Najoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.19'>And it was told Saul by some, saying: Behold David is in Najoth in Ramatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.20'>So Saul sent officers to take David: and when they saw a company of prophets prophesying, and Samuel presiding over them, the spirit of the Lord came also upon them, and they likewise began to prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.21'>And when this was told Saul, he sent other messengers: but they also prophesied. And again Saul sent messengers the third time: and they prophesied also. And Saul being exceedingly angry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.22'>Went also himself to Ramatha, and came as far as the great cistern, which is in Socho, and he asked, and said: In what place are Samuel and David? And it was told him: Behold they axe in Najoth in Ramatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.23'>And he went to Najoth in Ramatha, and the spirit of the Lord came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied till he came to Najoth in Ramatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.24'>And he stripped himself also of his garments, and prophesied with the rest before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and night. This gave occasion to a proverb: What! is Saul too among the prophets?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.20'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.1'>But David fled from Najoth, which is in Ramatha, and came and said to Jonathan: What have I done? what is my iniquity, and what is my sin against thy father, that he seeketh my life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.2'>And he said to him: God forbid, thou shalt not die: for my father will do nothing great or little, without first telling me: hath then my father hid this word only from me? no, this shall not be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.3'>And he swore again to David. And David said: Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, and he will say: Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved. But truly as the Lord liveth, and thy soul liveth, there is but one step (as I may say) between me and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.4'>And Jonathan said to David: Whatsoever thy soul shall say to me, I will do for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.5'>And David said to Jonathan: Behold to morrow is the new moon, and I according to custom am wont to sit beside the king to eat: let me go then that I may be hid in the field till the evening of the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.6'>If thy father look and inquire for me, thou shalt answer him: David asked me that he might run to Bethlehem his own city: because there are solemn sacrifices there for all his tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.7'>If he shall say, It is well: thy servant shall have peace: but if he be angry, know that his malice is come to its height.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.8'>Deal mercifully then with thy servant: for thou hast brought me thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thee. But if there be any iniquity in me, do thou kill me, and bring me not in to thy father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.9'>And Jonathan said: Far be this from thee: for if I should certainly know that evil is determined by my father against thee, I could do no otherwise than tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.10'>And David answered Jonathan: Who shall bring me word, if thy father should answer thee harshly concerning me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.11'>And Jonathan said to David: Come and let us go out into the field. And when they were both of them gone out into the field,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.12'>Jonathan said to David: O Lord God of Israel, if I shall discover my father's mind, to morrow or the day after, and there be any thing good for David, and I send not immediately to thee, and make it known to thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.13'>May the Lord do so and so to Jonathan and add still more. But if my father shall continue in malice against thee, I will discover it to thy ear, and will send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace, and the Lord be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.14'>And if I live, thou shalt shew me the kindness of the Lord: but if I die,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.16'>Jonathan therefore made a covenant with the house of David: and the Lord required it at the hands of David's enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.17'>And Jonathan swore again to David, because he loved him: for he loved him as his own soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.18'>And Jonathan said to him: To morrow is the new moon, and thou wilt be missed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.19'>For thy seat will be empty till after tomorrow. So thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place, where thou must be hid on the day when it is lawful to work, and thou shalt remain beside the stone, which is called Ezel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.20'>And I will shoot three arrows near it, and will shoot as if I were exercising myself at a mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.21'>And I will send a boy, saying to him: Go and fetch me the arrows.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.23'>And concerning the word which I and thou have spoken, the Lord be between thee and me for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.24'>So David was hid in the field, and the new moon came, and the king sat down to eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.25'>And when the king sat down upon his chair (according to custom) which was beside the wall, Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place appeared empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.26'>And Saul said nothing that day, for he thought it might have happened to him, that he was not clean, nor purified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.27'>And when the second day after the new moon was come, David's place appeared empty again. And Saul said to Jonathan his son: Why cometh not the son of Isai to meat neither yesterday nor to day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.28'>And Jonathan answered Saul: He asked leave of me earnestly to go to Bethlehem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.29'>And he said: Let me go, for there is a solemn sacrifice in the city, one of my brethren hath sent for me: and now if I have found favour in thy eyes, I will go quickly, and see my brethren. For this cause he came not to the king's table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.30'>Then Saul being angry against Jonathan said to him: Thou son of a woman that is the ravisher of a man, do I not know that thou lovest the son of Isai to thy own confusion and to the confusion of thy shameless mother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.31'>For as long as the son of Isai liveth upon earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Therefore now presently send, and fetch him to me: for he is the son of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.32'>And Jonathan answering Saul his father, said: Why shall he die: what hath he done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.33'>And Saul caught up a spear to strike him. And Jonathan understood that it was determined by his father to kill David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.34'>So Jonathan rose from the table in great anger, and did not eat bread on the second day after the new moon. For he was grieved for David, because his father had put him to confusion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.35'>And when the morning came, Jonathan went into the field, according to the appointment with David, and a little boy with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.36'>And he said to his boy: Go, and fetch me the arrows which I shoot. And when the boy ran, he shot another arrow beyond the boy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.37'>The boy therefore came to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot: and Jonathan cried after the boy, and said: Behold the arrow is there further beyond thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.38'>And Jonathan cried again after the boy, saying: Make haste speedily, stand not. And Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and brought them to his master:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.39'>And he knew not at all what was doing: for only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.40'>Jonathan therefore gave his arms to the boy, and said to him: Go, and carry them into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.41'>And when the boy was gone, David rose out of his place, which was towards the south, and falling on his face to the ground, adored thrice: and kissing one another, they wept together, but David more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.42'>And Jonathan said to David: Go in peace: and let all stand that we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord, saying: The Lord be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.5'>And David answered the priest, and said to him: Truly, as to what concerneth women, we have refrained ourselves from yesterday and the day before, when we came out, and the vessels of the young men were holy. Now this way is defiled, but it shall also be sanctified this day in the vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.6'>The priest therefore gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there, but only the loaves of proposition, which had been taken away from before the face of the Lord, that hot loaves might be set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.7'>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, within the tabernacle of the Lord: and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of Saul's herdsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.8'>And David said to Achimelech: Hast thou here at hand a spear, or a sword? for I brought not my own sword, nor my own weapons with me, for the king's business required haste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.9'>And the priest said: Lo, here is the sword of Goliath the Philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of Terebinth, wrapped up in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take this, take it, for here is no other but this. And David said: There is none like that, give it me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.11'>And the servants of Achis, when they saw David, said to him: Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to him in their dances, saying: Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.12'>But David laid up these words in his heart, and was exceedingly afraid at the face of Achis the king of Geth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.13'>And he changed his countenance before them, and slipt down between their hands: and he stumbled against the doors of the gate, and his spittle ran down upon his beard.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.9'>And the woman said to him: Behold thou knowest all that Saul hath done, and how he hath rooted out the magicians and soothsayers from the land: why then dost thou lay a snare for my life, to cause me to be put to death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.10'>And Saul swore unto her by the Lord, saying: As the Lord liveth there shall no evil happen to thee for this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.11'>And the woman said to him: Whom shall I bring up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.12'>And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice, and said to Saul: Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.13'>And the king said to her: Fear not: what hast thou seen? And the woman said to Saul: I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.14'>And he said to her: What form is he of? And she said: An old man cometh up, and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul understood that it was Samuel, and he bowed himself with his face to the ground, and adored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.15'>And Samuel said to Saul: Why hast thou disturbed my rest, that I should be brought up? And Saul said, I am in great distress: for the Philistines fight against me, and God is departed from me, and would not hear me, neither by the hand of prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest shew me what I shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.16'>And Samuel said: Why askest thou me, seeing the Lord has departed from thee, and is gone over to thy rival:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.17'>For the Lord will do to thee as he spoke by me, and he will rend thy kingdom out of thy hand, and will give it to thy neighbour David:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.18'>Because thou didst not obey the voice of the Lord, neither didst thou execute the wrath of his indignation upon Amalec. Therefore hath the Lord done to thee what thou sufferest this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.19'>And the Lord also will deliver Israel with thee into the hands of the Philistines: and to morrow thou and thy sons shall be with me: and the Lord will also deliver the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.20'>And forthwith Saul fell all along on the ground, for he was frightened with the words of Samuel, and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.21'>And the woman came to Saul (for he was very much troubled) and said to him: Behold thy handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand: and I hearkened unto the words which thou spokest to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.22'>Now therefore hear thou also the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set before thee a morsel of bread, that thou mayest eat and recover strength, and be able to go on thy journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.23'>But he refused, and said: I will not eat. But his servants and the woman forced him, and at length hearkening to their voice, he arose from the ground and sat upon the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.24'>Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she made haste and killed it: and taking meal kneaded it, and baked some unleavened bread,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.25'>And set it before Saul, and before his servants. And when they had eaten they rose up, and walked all that night.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.29'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.1'>Now all the troops of the Philistines were gathered together to Aphec: and Israel also camped by the fountain which is in Jezrahel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.2'>And the lords of the Philistines marched with their hundreds and their thousands: but David and his men were in the rear with Achis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.3'>And the princes of the Philistines said to Achis: What mean these Hebrews? And Achis said to the princes of the Philistines: Do you not know David, who was the servant of Saul the king of Israel, and hath been with me many days, or years, and I have found no fault in him, since the day that he fled over to me until this day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.4'>But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him, and they said to him: Let this man return, and abide in his place, which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest he be an adversary to us, when we shall begin to fight: for how can he otherwise appease his master, but with our heads?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.5'>Is not this David, to whom they sung in their dances, saying: Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.6'>Then Achis called David, and said to him: As the Lord liveth, thou art upright and good in my sight: and so is thy going out, and thy coming in with me in the army: and I have not found my evil in thee, since the day that thou camest to me unto this day: but thou pleasest not the lords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.7'>Return therefore, and go in peace, and offend not the eyes of the princes of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.8'>And David said to Achis: But what have I done, and what hast thou found in me thy servant, from the day that I have been in thy sight until this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.9'>And Achis answering said to David: I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: but the princes of the Philistines have said: He shall not go up with us to the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.10'>Therefore arise in the morning, thou, and the servants of thy lord, who came with thee: and when you are up before day, and it shall begin to be light, go on your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.11'>So David and his men arose in the night, that they might set forward in the morning, and returned to the land of the Philistines: and the Philistines went up to Jezrahel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.30'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.1'>Now when David and his men were come to Siceleg on the third day, the Amalecites had made an invasion on the south side upon Siceleg, and had smitten Siceleg, and burnt it with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.2'>And had taken the women captives that were in it, both little and great: and they had not killed any person, but had carried them with them, and went on their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.3'>So when David and his men came to the city, and found it burnt with fire, and that their wives and their sons, and their daughters were taken captives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.4'>David and the people that were with him, lifted up their voices, and wept till they had no more tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.5'>For the two wives also of David were taken captives, Achinoam the Jezrahelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.6'>And David was greatly afflicted: for the people had a mind to stone him, for the soul of every man was bitterly grieved for his sons, and daughters: but David took courage in the Lord his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.7'>And he said to Abiathar the priest the son of Achimelech: Bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought the ephod to David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.8'>And David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I pursue after these robbers, and shall I overtake them, or not? And the Lord said to him: Pursue after them: for thou shalt surely overtake them and recover the prey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.9'>So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and they came to the torrent Besor: and some being weary stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.10'>But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred stayed, who being weary could not go over the torrent Besor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.11'>And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David: and they gave him bread to eat, and water to drink,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.12'>As also a piece of a cake of figs, and two bunches of raisins. And when he had eaten them his spirit returned, and he was refreshed: for he had not eaten bread, nor drunk water three days, and three nights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.13'>And David said to him: To whom dost thou belong? or whence dost thou come? and whither art thou going? He said: I am a young man of Egypt, the servant of an Amalecite, and my master left me, because I began to be sick three days ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.14'>For we made an invasion on the south side of Cerethi, and upon Juda, and upon the south of Caleb, and we burnt Siceleg with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.15'>And David said to him: Canst thou bring me to this company? And he said: Swear to me by God, that thou wilt not kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee to this company. And David swore to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.16'>And when he had brought him, behold they were lying spread upon all the ground, eating and drinking, and as it were keeping a festival day, for all the prey, and the spoils which they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.17'>And David slew them from the evening unto the evening of the next day, and there escaped not a man of them, but four hundred young men, who had gotten upon camels, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.18'>So David recovered all that the Amalecites had taken, and he rescued his two wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.19'>And there was nothing missing small or great, neither of their sons or their daughters, nor of the spoils, and whatsoever they had taken: David recovered all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.20'>And he took all the flocks and the herds, and made them go before him: and they said: This is the prey of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.21'>And David came to the two hundred men, who being weary had stayed, and were not able to follow David, and he had ordered them to abide at the torrent Besor: and they came out to meet David, and the people that were with him. And David coming to the people saluted them peaceably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.22'>Then all the wicked and unjust men that had gone with David answering, said: Because they came not with us, we will not give them any thing of the prey which we have recovered: but let every man take his wife and his children, and be contented with them, and go his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.23'>But David said: You shall not do so, my brethren, with these things, which the Lord hath given us, who hath kept us, and hath delivered the robbers that invaded us into our hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.24'>And no man shall hearken to you in this matter. But equal shall be the portion of him that went down to battle and of him that abode at the baggage, and they shall divide alike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.25'>And this hath been done from that day forward, and since was made a statute, and an ordinance, and as a law in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.26'>Then David came to Siceleg, and sent presents of the prey to the ancients of Juda his neighbours, saying: Receive a blessing of the prey of the enemies of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.27'>To them that were in Bethel, and that were in Ramoth to the south, and to them that were in Jether,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.28'>And to them that were in Aroer and that were in Sephamoth, and that were in Esthamo,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.29'>And that were in Rachal, and that were in the cities of Jerameel, and that were in the cities of Ceni,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.30'>And that were in Arama, and that were in the lake Asan, and that were in Athach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.31'>And that were in Hebron, and to the rest that were in those places, in which David had abode with his men.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.31'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.1'>And the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gelboe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.2'>And the Philistines fell upon Saul, and upon his sons, and they slew Jonathan, and Abinadab and Melchisua the sons of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.3'>And the whole weight of the battle was turned upon Saul: and the archers overtook him, and he was grievously wounded by the archers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.4'>Then Saul said to his armourbearer: Draw thy sword, and kill me: lest these uncircumcised come, and slay me, and mock at me. And his armourbearer would not: for he was struck with exceeding great fear. Then Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.5'>And when his armourbearer saw this, to wit, that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.6'>So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men that same day together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.7'>And the men of Israel, that were beyond the valley, and beyond the Jordan, seeing that the Israelites were fled, and that Saul was dead, and his sons, forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came, and dwelt there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.8'>And on the morrow the Philistines came to strip the slain, and they found Saul and his three sons lying in mount Gelboe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.9'>And they cut off Saul's head, and stripped him of his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the temples of their idols, and among their people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.10'>And they put his armour in the temple of Astaroth, but his body they hung on the wall of Bethsan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.11'>Now when the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad had heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.12'>All the most valiant men arose, and walked all the night, and took the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, from the wall of Bethsan: and they came to Jabes Galaad, and burnt them there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.13'>And they took their bones and buried them in the wood of Jabes: and fasted seven days.</verse>
