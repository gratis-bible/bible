      <chapter osisID='Josh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'>Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke to Josue the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, and said to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'>Moses my servant is dead: arise, and pass over this Jordan, thou and thy people with thee, into the land which I will give to the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'>I will deliver to you every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, as I have said to Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'>From the desert and from Libanus unto the great river Euphrates, all the land of the Hethites unto the great sea toward the going; down of the sun, shall be your border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'>No man shall be able to resist you all the days of thy life: as I have been with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'>Take courage, and be strong: for thou shalt divide by lot to this people the land, for which I swore to their fathers, that I would deliver it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'>Take courage therefore, and be very valiant: that thou mayst observe and do all the law, which Moses my servant hath commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayst understand all things which thou dost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'>Let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth: but thou shalt meditate on it day and night, that thou mayst observe and do all things that are written in it: then shalt thou direct thy way, and understand it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'>Behold I command thee, take courage, end be strong. Fear not and be not dismayed: because the Lord thy God is with thee in all things whatsoever thou shalt go to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'>And Josue commanded the princes of the people, saying: Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, and say:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'>Prepare you victuals: for after the third day you shall pass over the Jordan and shall go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God will give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'>And he said to the Rubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'>Remember the word, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying: The Lord your God hath given you rest, and all this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'>Your wives, and children, and cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan: but pass you over armed before your brethren, all of you that are strong of hand, and fight for them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'>Until the Lord give rest to your brethren as he hath given you, and they also possess the land which the Lord your God will give them: and so you shall return into the land of your possession, and you shall dwell in it, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'>And they made answer to Josue, and said: All that thou hast commanded us we will do; and whithersoever thou shalt send us, we will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'>As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey thee also: only be the Lord thy God with thee, as he was with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'>He that shall gainsay thy mouth, and not obey all thy words, that thou shalt command him, let him die: only take thou courage, and do manfully.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'>And Josue the son of Nun sent from Setim two men, to spy secretly: and said to them: Go, and view the land and the city of Jericho. n They went and entered into the house of a woman that was a harlot named Rahab, and lodged with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'>And it was told the king of Jericho, and was said : Behold there are men come in hither, by night, of the children of Israel, to spy the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying: Bring forth the men that came to thee, and are entered into thy house: for they are spies, and are come to view all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'>And the woman taking the men, hid them, and said: I confess they came to me, but I knew not whence they were:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'>And at the time of shutting the gate in the dark, they also went out together. I know not whither they are gone: pursue after them quickly, and you will overtake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'>But she made the men go up to the top of her house, and covered them with the stalks of flax, which was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'>Now they that were sent, pursued after them, by the way that leadeth to the fords of the Jordan: and as soon as they were gone out, the gate was presently shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'>The men that were hidden were not yet asleep, when behold the woman went up to them, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'>the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea at your going in, when you came out of Egypt: and what things you did to the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan: Sehon and Og whom you slew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'>I know that the Lord hath given this land to you: for the dread of you is fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land have lost all strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'>We have heard that</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'>And hearing these things we were affrighted, and our heart fainted away, neither did there remain any spirit in us at your coming in: for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above, and in the earth beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'>Now therefore swear ye to me by the Lord, that as I have shewn mercy to you, so you also will shew mercy to my father's house: and give me a true token,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'>That you will save my father and mother, my brethren end sisters, and all things that are theirs, and deliver our souls from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'>They answered her: Be our lives for you unto death, only if thou betray us not. And when the Lord shall have delivered us the land, we will shew thee mercy and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'>Then she let them down with a cord out of a window: for her house joined close to the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'>And she said to them: Get ye up to the mountains, lest perhaps they meet you as they return: and there lie ye hid three days, till they come back, and so you shall go on your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'>And they said to her: We shall be blameless of this oath, which thou hast made us swear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'>If when we come into the land, this scarlet cord be a sign, and thou tie it in the window, by which thou hast let us down: and gather together thy father and mother, and brethren and all thy kindred into thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'>Whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house, his blood shall be upon his own head, and we shall be quit. But the blood of all that shall be with thee in the house, shall light upon our head, if any man touch them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'>But if thou wilt betray us, and utter this word abroad, we shall be quit of this oath which thou hast made us swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'>And she answered: As you have spoken, so be it done. And sending them on their way, she hung the scarlet cord in the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'>But they went and came to the mountains, and stayed there three days till they that pursued them were returned. For having sought them through all the way, they found them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.25'>And when they were gone back into the city, the spies returned, and came down from the mountain: and passing over the Jordan, they came to Josue the son of Nun, and told him all that befel them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.26'>And said: The Lord hath delivered all this land into our hands, and all the inhabitants thereof are overthrown with fear.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'>And Josue rose before daylight, and removed the camp: and they departed from Setim, and came to the Jordan, he, and all the children of Israel, and they abode there for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'>After which, the heralds went through the midst of the camp,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'>And began to proclaim: When you shall see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests of the race of Levi carrying it, rise you up also, and follow them as they go before:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'>And let there be between you and the ark the space of two thousand cubits: that you may see it afar off, and know which way you must go: for you have not gone this way before: and take care you come not near the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'>And Josue said to the people: Be ye sanctified: for to morrow the Lord will do wonders among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'>And he said to the priests: Take up the ark of the covenant, and go before the people. And they obeyed his commands, and took it up and walked before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'>And the Lord said to Josue: This day will I begin to exalt thee before Israel: that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I am with thee also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'>And do thou command the priests that carry the ark of the covenant, and say to them: When you shall have entered into part of the water of the Jordan, stand in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'>And Josue said to the children of Israel: Come hither and hear the word of the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'>And again he said: By this you shall know that the Lord the living God is in the midst of you, and that he shall destroy before your sight the Chanaanite and the Hethite, the Hevite and the Pherezite, the Gergesite also and the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'>Behold the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth shall go before you into the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'>Prepare ye twelve men of the tribes of Israel, one of every tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'>And when the priests, that carry the ark of the Lord the God of the whole earth, shall set the soles of their feet in the waters of the Jordan, the waters that are beneath shall run down and go off: and those that come from above, shall stand together upon a heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'>So the people went out of their tents, to pass over the Jordan: and the priests that carried the ark of the covenant. went on before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'>And as soon as they came into the Jordan, and their feet were dipped in part of the water, (now the Jordan, it being harvest time, had filled the banks of its channel,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'>The waters that came down from above stood in one place, and swelling up like a mountain, were seen afar off from the city that is called Adom, to the place of Sarthan: but those that were beneath, ran down into the sea of the wilderness (which now is called the Dead Sea) until they wholly failed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'>And the people marched over against Jericho: and the priests that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, stood girded upon the dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all the people passed over through the channel that was dried up.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'>And when they were passed over, the Lord said to Josue:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'>Choose twelve men, one of every tribe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'>And command them to take out of the midst of the Jordan, where the feet of the priests stood, twelve very hard stones, which you shall set in the place of the camp, where you shall pitch your tents this night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'>And Josue called twelve men, whom he had chosen out of the children of Israel, one out of every tribe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'>And he said to them: Go before the ark of the Lord your God to the midst of the Jordan, and carry from thence every man a stone on your shoulders, according to the number of the children of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'>That it may be a sign among you end when your children shall ask you to morrow, saying: What mean these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'>You shall answer them: The waters of the Jordan ran off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, when it passed over the same: therefore were these atones set for a monument of the children of Israel for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'>The children of Israel therefore did as Josue commanded them, carrying out of the channel of the Jordan twelve stones, as the Lord had commanded him, according to the number of the children of Israel, unto the place wherein they camped, and there they set them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'>And Josue put other twelve stones in the midst of the channel of the Jordan, where the priests stood that carried the ark of the covenant: and they are there until this present day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'>Now the priests that carried the ark, stood in the midst of the Jordan till all things were accomplished which the Lord had commanded Josue to speak to the people, and Moses had said to him. And the people made haste and passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'>And when they had all passed over, the ark also of the Lord passed over, and the priests went before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'>The children of Ruben also and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasses, went armed before the children of Israel as Moses had commanded them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'>And forty thousand fighting men by their troops, and bands, marched through the plains and fields of the city of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'>In that day the Lord magnified Josue in the sight of all Israel, that they should fear him, as they had feared Moses, while he lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.15'>And he said to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.16'>Command the priests, that carry the ark of the covenant, to come up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.17'>And he commanded them, saying: Come ye up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.18'>And when they that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, were come up, and began to tread on the dry ground, the waters returned into the channel, and ran as they were wont before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.19'>And the people came up out of the Jordan, the tenth day of the first month, and camped in Galgal, over against the east side of the city of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.20'>And the twelve stones which they had taken out of the channel of the Jordan, Josue pitched in Galgal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.21'>And said to the children of Israel: When your children shall ask their fathers, to morrow, and shall say to them: What mean these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.22'>You shall teach them and say: Israel passed over this Jordan through the dry channel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.23'>The Lord your God drying up the waters thereof in your sight, until you passed over:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.24'>As he had done before in the Red Sea, which he dried up till we passed through :</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.25'>That all the people of the earth may learn the most mighty hand of the Lord, that you also may fear the Lord your God for ever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'>Now when all the kings of the Amorrhites, who dwelt beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of Chanaan, who possessed the places near the great sea, had heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the children of Israel, till they passed over, their heart failed them, and there remained no spirit in them, fearing the coming in of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'>At that time the Lord said to Josue: Make thee knives of stone, and circumcise the second time the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.3'>He did what the Lord had commanded, and he circumcised the children of Israel in the hill of the foreskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.4'>Now this is the cause of the second circumcision: All the people that came out of Egypt that were males, all the men fit for war, died in the desert, during the time of the long going about in the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.5'>Now these were all circumcised. But the people that were born in the desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.6'>Luring the forty years of the journey in the wide wilderness, were uncircumcised: till all they were consumed that had not heard the voice of the Lord, and to whom he had sworn before, that he would not shew them the land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.7'>The children of these succeeded in the place of their fathers, and were circumcised by Josue: for they were uncircumcised even as they were born, and no one had circumcised them in the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.8'>Now after they were all circumcised, they remained in the same place of the camp, until they were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.9'>And the Lord said to Josue: This day have I taken away from you the reproach of Egypt. And the name of that place was called Galgal, until this present day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.10'>And the children of Israel abode in Galgal, and they kept the phase on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the plains of Jericho:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.11'>And they ate on the next day unleavened bread of the corn of the land, and frumenty of the same year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.12'>And the manna ceased after they ate of the corn of the land, neither did the children of Israel use that food any more, but they ate of the corn of the present year of the land of Chanaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.13'>And when Josue was in the field of the city of Jericho, he lifted up his eyes, and saw a man standing over against him: holding a drawn sword, and he went to him, and said: Art thou one of ours, or of our adversaries?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.14'>And he answered: No: but I am prince of the host of the Lord, and now I am come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.15'>Josue fell on his face to the ground. And worshipping, add: What saith my lord to his servant?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.16'>Loose, saith he, thy shoes from off thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Josue did as was commanded him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.1'>Now Jericho was close shut up and fenced, for fear of the children of Israel, and no man durst go out or come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.2'>And the Lord said to Josue: Behold I have given into thy hands Jericho, and the king thereof, and all the valiant men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.3'>Go round about the city, all ye fighting men, once a day: so shall ye do for six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.4'>And on the seventh day the priests shall take the seven trumpets, which are used in the jubilee, and shall go before the ark of the covenant: and you shall go about the city seven times, and the priests shall sound the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.5'>And when the voice of the trumpet shall give a longer and broken tune, and shall sound in your ears, all the people shall shout together with a very great shout, and the walls of the city shall fall to the ground, and they shall enter in every one at the place against which they shall stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.6'>Then Josue the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them: Take the ark of the covenant: and let seven other priests take the seven trumpets of the jubilee, and march before the ark of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.7'>And he said to the people: Go, and compass the city, armed, marching before the ark of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.8'>And when Josue had ended his words, and the seven priests blew the seven trumpets before the ark of the covenant of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.9'>And all the armed men went before, the rest of the common people followed the ark, and the sound of the trumpets was heard on all sides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.10'>But Josue had commanded the people, saying: You shall not shout, nor shall your voice be heard, nor any word go out of your mouth: until the day come wherein I shall say to you: Cry, and shout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.11'>So the ark of the Lord went about the city once a day, and returning into the camp, abode there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.12'>And Josue rising before day, the priests took the ark of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.13'>And seven of them seven trumpets, which are used in the jubilee: and they went before the ark of the Lord walking and sounding the trumpets: and the armed men went before them, and the rest of the common people followed the ark, and they blew the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.14'>And they went round about the city the second day once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.15'>But the seventh day, rising up early, they went about the city, as it was ordered, seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.16'>And when in the seventh going about the priests sounded with the trumpets, Josue said to all Israel: Shout: for the Lord hath delivered the city to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.17'>And let this city be an anathema, and all things that are in it, to the Lord. Let only Rahab the harlot live, with all that are with her in the house: for she hid the messengers whom we sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.18'>But beware ye lest you touch ought of those things that are forbidden, and you be guilty of transgression, and all the camp of Israel be under sin, and be troubled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.10.2'>He was exceedingly afraid. For Gabaon was a great city, and one of the royal cities, and greater than the town of Hai, and all its fighting men were most valiant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.3'>Therefore Adonisedec king of Jerusalem sent to Oham king of Hebron, and to Pharam king of Jerimoth, and to Japhia king of Lachis, and to Dabir king of Eglon, saying:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.10.5'>So the five kings of the Amorrhites being assembled together went up: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon, they and their armies, and camped about Gabaon, laying siege to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.6'>But the inhabitants of the city of Gabaon which was besieged, sent to Josue, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said to him: Withdraw not thy hands from helping thy servants: come up quickly and save us, and bring us succour: for all the kings of the Amorrhites, who dwell in the mountains, are gathered together against us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.10.25'>He said again to them: Fear not, neither be ye dismayed, take courage and be strong: for so will the Lord do to all your enemies, against whom you fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.26'>And Josue struck, and slew them, and hanged them upon five gibbets, and they hung until the evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.27'>And when the sun was down, he commanded the soldiers to take them down from the gibbets. And after they were taken down, they cast them into the cave where they had lain hid, and put great stones at the mouth thereof, which remain until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.28'>The same day Josue took Maceda and destroyed it, with the edge of the sword, and killed the king and all the inhabitants thereof: he left not in it the least remains. And he did to the king of Maceda, as he had done to the king of Jericho.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.22'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.1'>At the same time Josue called the Rubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.2'>And said to them: You have done all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you: you have also obeyed me in all things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.3'>Neither have you left your brethren this long time, until this present day, keeping the commandment of the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.4'>Therefore as the Lord your God hath given your brethren rest and peace, as he promised: return, and go to your dwellings, and to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.5'>Yet so that you observe attentively, and in work fulfil the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you: that you love the Lord your God, and walk in all his ways, and keep all his commandments, and cleave to him, and serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.6'>And Josue blessed them, and sent them away, and they returned to their dwellings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.7'>Now to half the tribe of Manasses, Moses had given a possession in Basan: and therefore to the half that remained, Josue gave a lot among the rest of their brethren beyond the Jordan to the west. And when he sent them away to their dwellings and had blessed them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.8'>He said to them : With much substance and riches, you return to your settlements, with silver and gold, brass and iron, and variety of raiment: divide the prey of your enemies with your brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.9'>So the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses returned, and parted from the children of Israel in Silo, which is in Chanaan, to go into Galaad the land of their possession, which they had obtained according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.10'>And when they were come to the banks of the Jordan, in the land of Chanaan, they built an altar immensely great near the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.11'>And when the children of Israel had heard of it, and certain messengers had brought them an account that the children of Ruben, and of Cad, and the half tribe of Manasses had built an altar in the land of Chanaan, upon the banks of the Jordan, over against the children of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.12'>They all assembled in Silo, to go up and fight against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.13'>And in the mean time they sent to them into the land of Galaad, Phinees the son of Eleazar the priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.14'>And ten princes with him, one of every tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.15'>Who came to the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses, into the land of Galaad, and said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.16'>Thus saith all the people of the Lord: What meaneth this transgression? Why have you forsaken the Lord the God of Israel, building a sacrilegious altar, and revolting from the worship of him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.17'>Is it a small thing to you that you sinned with Beelphegor, and the stain of that crime remaineth in us to this day? and many of the people perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.18'>And you have forsaken the Lord to day, and to morrow his wrath will rage against all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.19'>But if you think the land of your possession to be unclean, pass over to the land wherein is the tabernacle of the Lord, and dwell among us: only depart not from the Lord, and from our society, by building an altar beside the altar of the Lord our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.20'>Did not Achan the son of Zare transgress the commandment of the Lord, and his wrath lay upon all the people of Israel? And he was but one man, and would to God he alone had perished in his wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.21'>And the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasses answered the princes of the embassage of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.22'>The Lord the most mighty God, the Lord the most mighty God, he knoweth, and Israel also shall understand: If with the design of transgression we have set up this altar, let him not save us, but punish us immediately:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.23'>And if we did it with that mind, that we might lay upon it holocausts, and sacrifice, and victims of peace offerings, let him require and judge:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.24'>And not rather with this thought and design, that we should say: To morrow your children will say to our children: What have you to do with the Lord the God of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.25'>The Lord hath put the river Jordan for a border between us and you, O ye children of Ruben, and ye children of Gad: and therefore you have no part in the Lord. And by this occasion you children shall turn away our children from the fear of the Lord. We therefore thought, it best,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.26'>And said: Let us build us an altar, not for holocausts, nor to offer victims,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.27'>But for a testimony between us and you, and our posterity and yours, that we may serve the Lord, and that we may have a right to offer both holocausts, and victims and sacrifices of peace offerings: and that your children to morrow may not say to our children: You have no part in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.28'>And if they will say so, they shall answer them: Behold the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for holocausts, nor for sacrifice, but for a testimony between us and you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.29'>God keep us from any such wickedness that we should revolt from the Lord, and leave off following his steps, by building an altar to offer holocausts, and sacrifices, and victims, beside the altar of the Lord our God, which is erected before his tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.30'>And when Phinees the priest, and the princes of the embassage, who were with him, had heard this, they were satisfied: and they admitted most willingly the words of the children of Ruben, and Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.31'>And Phinees the priest the son of Eleazar said to them: Now we know that the Lord is with us, because you are not guilty of this revolt, and you have delivered the children of Israel from the hand of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.32'>And he returned with the princes from the children of Ruben and Gad, out of the land of Galaad, into the land of Chanaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.33'>And the saying pleased all that heard it. And the children of Israel praised God, and they no longer said that they would go up against them, and fight, and destroy the land of their possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.34'>And the children of Ruben, and the children of Cad called the altar which they had built, Our testimony, that the Lord is God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.23'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.1'>And when a long time was passed, after that the Lord had given peace to Israel, all the nations round about being subdued, and Josue being now old, and far advanced in years:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.2'>Josue called for all Israel, and for the elders, and for the princes, and for the judges, and for the masters, and said to them: I am old, and far advanced in years:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.3'>And you see all that the Lord your God hath done to all the nations round about, how he himself hath fought for you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.4'>And now since he hath divided to you by lot all the land, from the east of the Jordan unto the great sea, and many nations yet remain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.5'>The Lord your God will destroy them, and take them away from before your face, and you shall possess the land as he hath promised you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.6'>Only take courage, and be careful to observe all things that are written in the book of the law of Moses: and turn not aside from them neither to the right hand nor to the left:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.7'>Lest after that you are come in among the Gentiles, who will remain among you, you should swear by the name of their gods, and serve them, and adore them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.8'>But cleave ye unto the Lord your God: as you have done until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.9'>And then the Lord God will take away before your eyes nations that are great and very strong, and no man shall be able to resist you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.10'>One of you shall chase a thousand men of the enemies: because the Lord your God himself will fight for you, as he hath promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.11'>,11This only take care of with all diligence, that you love the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.12'>But if you will embrace the errors of these nations that dwell among you, and make marriages with them, and join friendships:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.13'>Know ye for a certainty that the Lord your God will not destroy them be- fore your face, but they shall be a pit and a snare in your way, and a stumblingblock at your side, and stakes in your eyes, till he take you away and destroy you from off this excellent land, which he hath given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.14'>Behold this day I am going into the way of all the earth, and you shall know with all your mind that of all the words which the Lord promised to perform for you, not one hath failed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.15'>Therefore as he hath fulfilled in deed, what he promised, and all things prosperous have come: so Will he bring upon you all the evils he hath threatened, till he take you away and destroy you from off this excellent land, which he hath given you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.16'>When you shall have transgressed the covenant of the Lord your God, which he hath made with you, and shall have served strange gods, and adored them : then shall the indignation of the Lord rise up quickly and speedily against you, and you shall be taken away from this excellent land, which he hath delivered to you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.24'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.1'>And Josue gathered together all the tribes of Israel in Sichem, and called for the ancients, and the princes, and the judges, and the masters: and they stood in the sight of the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.2'>And he spoke thus to the people: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Your fathers dwelt of old on the other side of the river, Thare the father of Abraham, and Nachor: and they served strange gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.3'>And I took your father Abraham from the borders of Mesopotamia: and brought him into the land of Chanaan: and I multiplied his seed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.4'>And gave him Isaac: and to him again I gave Jacob and Esau. And I gave to Esau mount Seir for his possession: but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.5'>And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I struck Egypt with many signs and wonders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.6'>And I brought you and your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea: and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen, as far as the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.7'>And the children of Israel cried to the Lord: and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them. Your eyes saw all that I did in Egypt, and you dwelt in the wilderness a long time:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.8'>And I brought you into the land of the Amorrhite, who dwelt beyond the Jordan. And when they fought against you, I delivered them into your hands, and you possessed their land, and slew them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.9'>And Balac son of Sephor king of Moab arose and fought against Israel. And he sent and called for Balaam son of Beor, to curse you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.10'>And I would not hear him, but on the contrary I blessed you by him, and I delivered you out of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.11'>And you passed over the Jordan, and you came to Jericho. And the men of that city fought against you, the Amorrhite, and the Pherezite, and the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Gergesite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite: and I delivered them into your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.12'>And I sent before you hornets: and I drove them out from their places, the two kings of the Amorrhites, not with thy sword nor with thy bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.13'>And I gave you a land, in which you had not laboured, and cities to dwell in which you built not, vineyards and oliveyards, which you planted not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.14'>Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him with a perfect and most sincere heart: and put away the gods which your fathers served in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, and serve the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.15'>But if it seem evil to you to serve the Lord, you have your choice: choose this day that which pleaseth you, whom you would rather serve, whether the gods which your fathers served in Mesopotamia, or the gods of the Amorrhites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.16'>And the people answered, and said: God forbid we should leave the Lord, and serve strange gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.17'>The Lord our God he brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage: and did very great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way by which we journeyed, and among all the people through whom we passed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.18'>And he hath cast out all the nations, the Amorrhite the inhabitant of the land into which we are come. Therefore we will serve the Lord, for he is our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.19'>And Josue said to the people: You will not be able to serve the Lord: for he is a holy God, and mighty and jealous, and will not forgive your wickedness and sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.20'>If you leave the Lord, and serve strange gods, he will turn, and will afflict you, and will destroy you after all the good he hath done you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.21'>And the people said to Josue: No, it shall not be so as thou sayest, but we will serve the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.22'>And Josue said to the people: You are witnesses, that you yourselves have chosen you the Lord to serve him. And they answered: We are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.23'>Now therefore, said he, put away strange gods from among you, and incline your hearts to the Lord the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.24'>And the people said to Josue: We will serve the Lord our God, and we will be obedient to his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.25'>Josue therefore on that day made a covenant, and set before the people commandments and judgments in Sichem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.26'>And he wrote all these things in the volume of the law of the Lord: and he took a great stone, and set it under the oak that was in the sanctuary of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.27'>And he said to all the people: Behold this stone shall be a testimony unto you, that it hath heard all the words of the Lord, which he hath spoken to you: lest perhaps hereafter you will deny it, and lie to the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.28'>And he sent the people away every one to their own possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.29'>And after these things Josue the son of Null the servant of the Lord died, being a hundred and ten years old:</verse>
