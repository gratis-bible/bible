      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.1'>And Moab rebelled against Israel, after the death of Achab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.2'>And Ochozias fell through the lattices of his upper chamber which he had in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, saying to them: Go, consult Beelzebub, the god of Accaron, whether I shall recover of this my illness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.3'>And an angel of the Lord spoke to Elias the Thesbite, saying: Arise, and go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them: Is there not a God in Israel, that ye go to consult Beelzebub the god of Accaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.4'>Wherefore thus saith the Lord: From the bed, on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down, but thou shalt surely die. And Elias went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.5'>And the messengers turned back to Ochozias. And he said to them: Why are you come back?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.6'>But they answered him: A man met us, and said to us: Go, and return to the king, that sent you, and you shall say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Is it because there was no God in Israel that thou sendest to Beelzebub the god of Accaron? Therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed, on which thou art gone up, but then shalt surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.7'>And he said to them: What manner of man was he who met you, and spoke these words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.8'>But they said: A hairy man with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said: It is Elias the Thesbite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.9'>And he sent to him a captain of fifty, and the fifty men that were under him. And he went up to him, and as he was sitting on the top of a hill, said to him: Man of God, the king hath commanded that thou come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.10'>And Elias answering, said to the captain of fifty: If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee, and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him, and the fifty that were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.11'>And again he sent to him another captain of fifty men, and his fifty with him. And he said to him: Man of God, thus saith the king: Make haste and come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.12'>Elias answering, said: If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And fire came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.13'>Again he sent a third captain of fifty men, and the fifty that were with him. And when he was come, he fell upon his knees, before Elias, and besought him and said: Man of God, despise not my life, and the lives of thy servants that are with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.14'>Behold fire came down from heaven, and consumed the two first captains of fifty men, and the fifties that were with them: but now I beseech thee to spare my life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.15'>And the angel of the Lord spoke to Elias, saying: Go down with him, fear not. He arose therefore, and went down with him to the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.16'>And said to him: Thus saith the Lord: Because thou hast sent messengers to consult Beelzebub the god of Accaron, as though there were not a God in Israel, of whom thou mightest inquire the word; therefore from the bed on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down, but thou shalt surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.17'>So he died according to the word of the Lord which Elias spoke, and Joram his brother reigned in his stead, in the second year of Joram the son of Josaphat king of Juda: because he had no son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.18'>But the rest of the acts of Ochozias which he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.1'>And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elias into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elias and Eliseus were going from Galgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.2'>And Elias said to Eliseus: Stay thou here, because the Lord hath sent me as far as Bethel. And Eliseus said to him: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And when they were come down to Bethel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.3'>The sons of the prophets, that were at Bethel, came forth to Eliseus, and said to him: Dost thou know that this day the Lord will take away thy master from thee? And he answered: I also know it: hold your peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.4'>And Elias said to Eliseus: Stay here because the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. And he said: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And when they were come to Jericho,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.5'>The sons of the prophets that were at Jericho, came to Eliseus, and said to him: Dost thou know that this day the Lord will take away thy master from thee? And he said: I also know it: hold your peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.6'>And Elias said to him: Stay here, because the Lord hath sent me as far as the Jordan. And he said: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee; and they two went on together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.7'>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets followed them, and stood in sight at a distance: but they two stood by the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.8'>And Elias took his mantle and folded it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, and they both passed over on dry ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.9'>And when they were gone over, Elias said to Eliseus: Ask what thou wilt have me to do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Eliseus said: I beseech thee that in me may be thy double spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.10'>And he answered: Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee, thou shalt have what thou hast asked: but if thou see me not, thou shalt not have it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.11'>And as they went on, walking and talking together, behold a fiery chariot, and fiery horses parted them both asunder: and Elias went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.12'>And Eliseus saw him, and cried: My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the driver thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own garments, and rent them in two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.13'>And he took up the mantle of Elias, that fell from him: and going back, he stood upon the bank of the Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.14'>And he struck the waters with the mantle of Elias, that had fallen from him, and they were not divided. And he said: Where is now the God of Elias? And he struck the waters, and they were divided, hither and thither, and Eliseus passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.15'>And the sons of the prophets at Jericho, who were over against him, seeing it said: The spirit of Elias hath rested upon Eliseus. And coming to meet him, they worshipped him, falling to the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.16'>And they said to him: Behold, there are with thy servants fifty strong men, that can go, and seek thy master, lest perhaps the spirit of the Lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley. And he said: Do not send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.17'>But they pressed him, till he consented, and said: Send. And they sent fifty men: and they sought three days but found him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.18'>And they came back to him: for he abode at Jericho, and he said to them: Did I not say to you: Do not send?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.19'>And the men of the city said to Eliseus: Behold the situation of this city is very good, as thou, my lord, seest: but the waters are very bad, and the ground barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.20'>And he said: Bring me a new vessel, and put salt into it. And when they had brought it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.21'>He went out to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt into it, and said: Thus saith the Lord: I have healed these waters, and there shall be no more in them death or barrenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.22'>And the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Eliseus, which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.23'>And he went up from thence to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, little boys came out of the city and mocked him, saying: Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.24'>And looking back, he saw them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord: and there came forth two bears out of the forest, and tore of them two and forty boys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.25'>And from thence he went to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.1'>And Joram the son of Achab reigned over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of m Josaphat king of Juda. And he reigned twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.2'>And he did evil before the Lord, but not like his father and his mother: for he took away the statues of Baal, which his father had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.3'>Nevertheless he stuck to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, nor did he depart from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.4'>Now Mesa, king of Moab, nourished many sheep, and he paid to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams with their fleeces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.5'>And when Achab was dead, he broke the league which he had made with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.6'>And king Joram went out that day from Samaria, and mustered all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.7'>And he sent to Josaphat king of Juda, saying: The king of Moab is revolted from me, come with me against him to battle. And he answered: I will come up: he that is mine, is thine: my people, thy people: and my horses, thy horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.8'>And he said: Which way shall we go up? But he answered: By the desert of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.9'>So the king of Israel, and the king of Juda, and the king of Edom went, and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey, and there was no water for the army, and for the beasts, that followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.10'>And the king of Israel said: Alas, alas, alas, the Lord hath gathered us three kings together, to deliver us into the hands of Moab!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.11'>And Josaphat said: Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may beseech the Lord by him? And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered: Here is Eliseus the son of Saphat, who poured water on the hands of Elias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.12'>And Josaphat said: The word of the Lord is with him. And the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, and the king of Edom went down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.13'>And Eliseus said to the king of Israel: What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father, and thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him: Why hath the Lord gathered together these three kings, to deliver them into the hands of Moab?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.14'>And Eliseus said to him: As the Lord of hosts liveth, in whose sight I stand, if I did not reverence the face of Josaphat king of Juda, I would not have hearkened to thee, nor looked on thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.15'>But now bring me hither a minstrel. And when the minstrel played, the hand of the Lord came upon him, and he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.16'>Thus saith the Lord: Make the channel of this torrent full of ditches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.17'>For thus saith the Lord: You shall not see wind, nor rain: and yet this channel shall be filled with waters, and you shall drink, you and your families, and your beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.18'>And this is a small thing in the sight of the Lord: moreover he will deliver also Moab into your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.19'>And you shall destroy every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall cut down every fruitful tree, and shall stop up all the springs of waters, and every goodly field you shall cover with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.20'>And it came to pass in the morning, when the sacrifices used to be offered, that behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.21'>And all the Moabites hearing that the kings were come up to fight against them, gathered together all that were girded with a belt upon them, and stood in the borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.22'>And they rose early in the morning, and the sun being now up, and shining upon the waters, the Moabites saw the waters over against them red, like blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.23'>And they said: It is the blood of the sword: the kings have fought among themselves, and they have killed one another: go now, Moab, to the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.24'>And they went into the camp of Israel: but Israel rising up defeated Moab, who fled before them. And they being conquerors, went and smote Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.25'>And they destroyed the cities: and they filled every goodly field, every man casting his stone: and they stopt up all the springs of waters: and cut down all the trees that bore fruit, so that brick walls only remained: and the city was beset by the slingers, and a great part thereof destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.26'>And when the king of Moab saw this, to wit, that the enemies had prevailed, he took with him seven hundred men that drew the sword, to break in upon the king of Edom: but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.27'>Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall: and there was great indignation in Israel, and presently they departed from him, and returned into their own country.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.1'>Now a certain woman of the wives of the prophets cried to Eliseus, saying: Thy servant my husband is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant was one that feared God, and behold the creditor is come to take away my two sons to serve him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.2'>And Eliseus said to her: What wilt thou have me to do for thee? Tell me, what hast thou in thy house? And she answered: I thy handmaid have nothing in my house but a little oil, to anoint me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.3'>And he said to her: Go, borrow of all thy neighbours empty vessels not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.4'>And go in, and shut thy door, when thou art within, and thy sons: and pour out thereof into all those vessels: and when they are full take them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.5'>So the woman went, and shut the door upon her, and upon her sons: they brought her the vessels, and she poured in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.6'>And when the vessels were full, she said to her son: Bring me yet a vessel. And he answered: I have no more. And the oil stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.7'>And she came, and told the man of God. And he said: Go, sell the oil, and pay thy creditor: and thou and thy sons live of the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.8'>And there was a day when Eliseus passed by Sunam: now there was a great woman there, who detained him to eat bread; and as he passed often that way, he turned into her house to eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.9'>And she said to her husband: I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who often passeth by us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.10'>Let us therefore make him a little chamber, and put a little bed in it for him, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick, that when he cometh to us, he may abide there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.11'>Now there was a certain day when he came and turned in to the chamber, and rested there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.12'>And he said to Giezi his servant Call this Sunamitess. And when he had called her, and she stood before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.13'>He said to his servant: Say to her Behold thou hast diligently served us in all things, what wilt thou have me to de for thee? hast thou any business, and wilt thou that I speak to the king, or to the general of the army? And she answered: I dwell in the midst of my own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.14'>And he said : What will she then that I do for her? And Giezi said: Do not ask, for she hath no son, and her husband is old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.15'>Then he bid him call her: And when she was called, and stood before the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.16'>He said to her: At this time, and this same hour, if life accompany, thou shalt have a son in thy womb. But she answered: Do not, I beseech thee, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.17'>And the woman conceived, and brought forth a son in the time, and at the same hour, that Eliseus had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.18'>And the child grew. And on a certain day, when he went out to his father to the reapers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.19'>He said to his father: My head acheth, my head acheth. But he said to his servant: Take him, and carry him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.20'>And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, she set him on her knees until noon, and then he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.21'>And she went up and laid him upon the bed of the man of God, and shut the door: and going out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.22'>She called her husband, and said: Send with me, I beseech thee, one of thy servants, and an ass that I may run to the man of God, and come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.23'>And he said to her: Why dost thou go to him? to day is neither new moon nor sabbath. She answered: I will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.24'>And she saddled an ass, and commanded her servant: Drive, and make haste, make no stay in going. And do that which I bid thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.25'>So she went forward, and came to the man of God to mount Carmel: and when the mall of God saw her coming towards, he said to Giezi his servant : Behold that Sunamitess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.26'>Go therefore to meet her, and say to her: Is all well with thee, and with thy husband, and with thy son? and she answered: Well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.27'>And when she came to the man of God to the mount, she caught hold on his feet: and Giezi came to remove her. And the man of God said: Let her alone for her soul is in anguish, and the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.28'>And she said to him: Did I ask a son of my lord? did I not say to thee: Do not deceive me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.29'>Then he said to Giezi: Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go. If any man meet thee, salute him not: and if any man salute thee, answer him not: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.30'>But the mother of the child said: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. He arose, therefore, and followed her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.31'>But Giezi was gone before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child, and there was no voice nor sense: and he returned to meet him, and told him, saying: The child is not risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.32'>Eliseus therefore went into the house, and behold the child lay dead on his bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.33'>And going in he shut the door upon him, and upon the child, and prayed to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.34'>And he went up, and lay upon the child: and he put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he bowed himself upon him, and the child's flesh grew warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.35'>Then he returned and walked in the house, once to and fro: and he went up, and lay upon him: and the child gaped seven times, and opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.36'>And he called Giezi, and said to him: Call this Sunamitess. And she being called, went in to him: and he said: Take up thy son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.37'>She came and fell at his feet, and worshipped upon the ground: and took up her son, and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.38'>And Eliseus returned to Galgal, and there was a famine in the land, and the sons of the prophets dwelt before him. And he said to one of his servants: Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.</verse>
