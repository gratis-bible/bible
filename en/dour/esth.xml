      <chapter osisID='Esth.1'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.1'>In the days of Assuerus, who reigned from India to Ethiopia over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.2'>When he sat on the throne of his kingdom, the city Susan was the capital of his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.3'>Now in the third year of his reign he made a great feast for all the princes, and for his servants, for the most mighty of the Persians, and the nobles of the Medes, and the governors of the provinces in his sight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.4'>That he might shew the riches of the glory of his kingdom, and the greatness, and boasting of his power, for a long time, to wit, for a hundred and fourscore days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.5'>And when the days of the feast were expired, he invited all the people that were found in Susan, from the greatest to the least: and commanded a feast to be made seven days in the court of the garden, and of the wood, which was planted by the care and the hand of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.6'>And there were hung up on every side sky coloured, and green, and violet hangings, fastened with cords of silk, and of purple, which were put into rings of ivory, and were held up with marble pillars. The beds also were of gold and silver, placed in order upon a floor paved with porphyry and white marble: which was embellished with painting of wonderful variety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.7'>And they that were invited, drank in golden cups, and the meats were brought in divers vessels one after another. Wine also in abundance and of the best was presented, as was worthy of a king's magnificence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.8'>Neither was there any one to compel them to drink that were not willing, but as the king had appointed, who set over every table one of his nobles, that every man might take what he would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.9'>Also Vasthi the queen made a feast for the women in the palace, where king Assuerus was used to dwell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.10'>Now on the seventh day, when the king was merry, and after very much drinking was well warmed with wine, he commanded Mauman, and Bazatha, and Harbona, and Bagatha, and Abgatha, and Zethar, and Charcas, the seven eunuchs that served in his presence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.11'>To bring in queen Vasthi before the king, with the crown set upon her head, to shew her beauty to all the people and the princes: for she was exceeding beautiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.12'>But she refused, and would not come at the king's commandment, which he had signified to her by the eunuchs. Whereupon the king, being angry, and inflamed with a very great fury,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.13'>Baked the wise men, who according to the custom of the kings, were always near his person, and all he did was by their counsel, who knew the laws, and judgments of their forefathers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.14'>(Now the chief and nearest him were, Charsena, and Sethar, and Admatha, and Tharsis, and Mares, and Marsana, and Mamuchan, seven princes of the Persians, and of the Medes, who saw the face of the king, and were used to sit first after him :)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.15'>What sentence ought to pass upon Vasthi the queen, who had refused to obey the commandment of king Assuerus, which he had sent to her by the eunuchs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.16'>And Mamuchan answered, in the hearing of the king and the princes: Queen Vasthi hath not only injured the king, but also all the people and princes that are in all the provinces of king Assuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.17'>For this deed of the queen will go abroad to all women, so that they will despise their husbands, and will say: King Assuerus commanded that queen Vasthi should come in to him, and she would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.18'>And by this example all the wives of the princes of the Persians and the Medes will slight the commandments of their husbands: wherefore the king's indignation is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.19'>If it please thee, let an edict go out from thy presence, and let it be written according to the law of the Persians and of the Medes, which must not be altered, that Vasthi come in no more to the king, but another, that is better than her, be made queen in her place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.20'>And let this be published through all the provinces of thy empire, (which is very wide,) and let all wives, as well of the greater as of the lesser, give honour to their husbands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.21'>His counsel pleased the king, and the princes: and the king did according to the counsel of Mamuchan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.22'>And he sent letters to all the provinces of his kingdom, as every nation could hear and read, in divers languages and characters, that the husbands should be rulers and masters in their houses: and that this should be published to every people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.1'>After this, when the wrath of king Assuerus was appeased, he remembered Vasthi, and what she had done end what she had suffered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.2'>And the king's servants and his officers said: Let young women be sought for the king, virgins and beautiful,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.3'>And let some persons be sent through all the provinces to look for beautiful maidens and virgins: and let them bring them to the city of Susan, and put them into the house of the women under the hand of Egeus the eunuch, who is the overseer and keeper of the king's women: and let them receive women's ornaments, and other things necessary for their use.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.4'>And whosoever among them all shall please the king's eyes, let her be queen instead of Vasthi. The word pleased the king: and he commanded it should be done as they had suggested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.5'>There was a man in the city of Susan, a Jew, named Mardochai, the son of Jair, the son of Semei, the son of Cis, of the race of Jemini,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.6'>Who had been carried away from Jerusalem at the time that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon carried away Jechonias king of Juda,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.7'>And he had brought up his brother's daughter Edissa, who by another name was called Esther: now she had lost both her parents: and was exceeding fair and beautiful. And her father and mother being dead, Mardochai adopted her for his daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.8'>And when the king's ordinance was noised abroad, and according to his commandment many beautiful virgins were brought to Susan, and were delivered to Egeus the eunuch: Esther also among the rest of the maidens was delivered to him to be kept in the number of the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.9'>And she pleased him, and found favour in his sight. And he commanded the eunuch to hasten the women's ornaments, and to deliver to her her part, and seven of the most beautiful maidens of the king's house, and to adorn and deck out both her and her waiting maids.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.10'>And she would not tell him her people nor her country. For Mardochai had charged her to say nothing at all of that:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.11'>And he walked every day before the court of the house, in which the chosen virgins werre kept, having a care for Esther's welfare, and desiring to know what would befall her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.12'>Now when every virgin's turn came to go in to the king, after all had been done for setting them off to advantage, it was the twelfth month: so that for six months they were anointed with oil of myrrh, and for other six months they used certain perfumes and sweet spices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.13'>And when they were going in to the king, whatsoever they asked to adorn themselves they received: and being decked out, as it pleased them, they passed from the chamber of the women to the king's chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.14'>And she that went in at evening, came out in the morning, and from thence she was conducted to the second house, that was under the hand of Susagaz the eunuch, who had the charge over the king's concubines: neither could she re- turn any more to the king, unless the king desired it, and had ordered her by name to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.15'>And as the time came orderly about, the day was at hand, when Esther, the daughter of Abihail the brother of Mardochai, whom he had adopted for his daughter, was to go in to the king. But she sought not women's ornaments, but whatsoever Egeus the eunuch the keeper of the virgins had a mind, he gave her to adorn her. For she was exceeding fair, and her incredible beauty made her appear agreeable and amiable in the eyes of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.16'>So she was brought to the chamber of king Assuerus the tenth month, which is called Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.17'>And the king loved her more than all the women, and she had favour and kindness before him above all the women, and he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vasthi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.18'>And he commanded a magnificent feast to be prepared for all the princes, and for his servants, for the marriage and wedding of Esther. And he gave rest to all the provinces, and bestowed gifts according to princely magnificence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.19'>And when the virgins were sought the second time, and gathered together, Mardochai stayed at the king's gate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.20'>Neither had Esther as yet declared her country and people, according to his commandment. For whatsoever he commanded, Esther observed: and she did all things in the same manner as she was wont at that time when he brought her up a little one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.21'>At that time, therefore, when Mardochai abode at the king's gate, Bagathan and Thares, two of the king's eunuchs, who were porters, and presided in the first entry of the palace, were angry: and they designed to rise up against the king, and to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.22'>And Mardochai had notice of it, and immediately he told it to queen Esther: and she to the king in Mardochai's name, who had reported the thing unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.23'>It was inquired into, and found out: and they were both hanged on a gibbet. And it was put in the histories, and recorded in the chronicles before the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.1'>After these things, king Assuerus advanced Aman, the son of Amadathi, who was of the race of Agag: and he set his throne above all the princes that were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.2'>And all the king's servants, that were at the doors of the palace, bent their knees, and worshipped Aman: for so the emperor had commanded them, only Mardochai did not bend his knee, nor worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.3'>And the king's servants that were chief at the doors of the palace, said to him: Why dost thou alone not observe the king's commandment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.4'>And when they were saying this often, and he would not hearken to them; they told Aman, desirous to know whether he would continue in his resolution: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.5'>Now when Aman had heard this, and had proved by experience that Mardochai did not bend his knee to him, nor worship him, he was exceeding angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.6'>And he counted it nothing to lay his hands upon Mardochai alone: for he had heard that he was of the nation of the Jews, and he chose rather to destroy all the nation of the Jews that were in the kingdom of Assuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.7'>In the first month (which is called Nisan) in the twelfth year a of the reign of Assuerus, the lot was cast into an urn, which in Hebrew is called Phur, before Aman, on what day and what month the nation of the Jews should be destroyed: and there came out the twelfth month, which is called Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.8'>And Aman said to king Assuerus: There is a people scattered through all the provinces of thy kingdom, and separated one from another, that use new laws and ceremonies, and moreover despise the king's ordinances: and thou knowest very well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they should grow insolent by impunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.9'>If it please thee, decree that they may he destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents to thy treasurers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.10'>And the king took the ring that he used, from his own hand, and gave it to Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy of the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.11'>And he said to him: As to the money which thou promisest, keep it for thyself: and as to the people, do with them as seemeth good to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.12'>And the king's scribes were called in the first month Nisan, on the thirteenth day of the same month: and they wrote, as Aman had commanded, to all the king's lieutenants, and to the judges of the provinces, and of divers nations, as every nation could read, and hear according to their different languages, in the name of king Assuerus: and the letters, sealed with his ring,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.13'>Were sent by the king's messengers to all provinces, to kill and destroy all the Jews, both young and old, little children, and women, in one day, that is, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month, which is called Adar, and to make a spoil of their goods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.14'>And the contents of the letters were to this effect, that all provinces might know and be ready against that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.15'>The couriers that were sent made haste to fulfil the king's commandment. And immediately the edict was hung up in Susan, the king and Aman feasting together, and all the Jews that were in the city weeping.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.1'>Now when Mardochai had heard these things, he rent his garments, and put on sackcloth, strewing ashes on his head: and he cried with a loud voice in the street in the midst of the city, shewing the anguish of his mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.2'>And he came lamenting in this manner even to the gate of the palace: for no one clothed with sackcloth might enter the king's court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.3'>And in all provinces, towns, and places, to which the king's cruel edict was come, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, wailing, and weeping, many using sackcloth and ashes for their bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.4'>Then Esther's maids and her eunuchs went in, and told her. And when she heard it she was in a consternation: and she sent a garment, to clothe him, and to take away the sackcloth: but he would not receive it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.5'>And she called for Athach the eunuch, whom the king had appointed to attend upon her, and she commanded him to go to Mardochai, and learn of him why he did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.6'>And Athach going out went to Mardochai, who was standing in the street of the city, before the palace gate:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.7'>And Mardochai told him all that had happened, how Aman had promised to pay money into the king's treasures, to have the Jews destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.8'>He gave him also a copy of the edict which was hanging up in Susan, that he should shew it to the queen, and admonish her to go in to the king, and to en- treat him for her people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.9'>And Athach went back and told Esther all that Mardochai had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.10'>She answered him, and bade him say to Mardochai:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.11'>,11All the king's servants, and all the provinces that are under his dominion, know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, cometh into the king's inner court, who is not called for, is immediately to be put to death without any delay: except the king shall hold out the golden sceptre to him, in token of clemency, that so he may live. How then can I go in to the king, who for these thirty days now have not been called unto him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.12'>And when Mardochai had heard this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.13'>He sent word to Esther again, saying: Think not that thou mayst save thy life only, because thou art in the king a house, more than all the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.14'>For if thou wilt now hold thy peace, the Jews shall be delivered by some other occasion: and thou, and thy father's house shall perish. And who knoweth whether thou art not therefore come to the kingdom, that thou mightest be ready in such a time as this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.15'>And again Esther sent to Mardochai in these words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.16'>Go, and gather together all the Jews whom thou shalt find in Susan, and pray ye for me. Neither eat nor drink for three days and three nights: and I with my handmaids will fast in like manner, and then I will go in to the king, against the law, not being called, and expose myself to death and to danger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.17'>So Mardochai went, and did all that Esther had commanded him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.5'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.1'>And on the third day Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's hall: now he sat upon his throne in the hall of the palace, over against the door of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.2'>And when he saw Esther the queen standing, she pleased his eyes, and he held out toward her the golden sceptre, which he held in his hand: and she drew near, and kissed the top of his sceptre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.3'>And the king said to her: What wilt then, queen Esther? what is thy request? if thou shouldst even ask one half of the kingdom, it shall be given to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.4'>But she answered: If it please the king. I beseech thee to come to me this day, and Aman with thee to the banquet which I have prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.5'>And the king said forthwith: Call ye Aman quickly, that he may obey Esther's will. So the king and Aman came to the banquet which the queen had prepared for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.6'>And the king said to her, after he had drunk wine plentifully: What dost thou desire should be given thee? and for what thing askest thou? although thou shouldst ask the half of my kingdom, thou shalt have it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.7'>And Esther answered: My petition and request is this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.8'>If I have found favour in the king's sight, and if it please the king to give me what I ask, and to fulfil my petition: let the king and Aman come to the banquet which I have prepared them, and to morrow I will open my mind to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.9'>So Aman went out that day joyful and merry. And when he saw Mardochai sitting before the gate of the palace, and that he not only did not rise up to honour him, but did not so much as move from the place where he sat, he was exceedingly angry:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.10'>But dissembling his anger, and returning into his house, he called together to him his friends, and Zares his wife:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.11'>And he declared to them the greatness of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and with how great glory the king had advanced him above all his princes and servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.12'>And after this he said: Queen Esther also hath invited no other to the banquet with the king, but me: and with her I am also to dine to morrow with the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.13'>And whereas I have all these things, I think I have nothing, so long as I see Mardochai the Jew sitting before the king's gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.14'>Then Zares his wife, and the rest of his friends answered him: Order a great beam to be prepared, fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king, that Mardochai may be hanged upon it, and so thou shalt go full of joy with the king to the banquet. The counsel pleased him, and he commanded a high gibbet to be prepared.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.6'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.1'>That night the king passed without sleep, and he commanded the histories and chronicles of former times to be brought him. And when they were reading them before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.2'>They came to that place where it was written, how Mardochai had discovered the treason of Bagathan and Thares the eunuchs, who sought to kill king Assuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.3'>And when the king heard this, he said: What honour and reward hath Mardochai received for this fidelity? His servants and ministers said to him: He hath received no reward at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.4'>And the king said immediately: Who is in the court? for Aman was coming in to the inner court of the king's house, to speak to the king, that he might order Mardochai to be hanged upon the gibbet which was prepared for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.5'>The servants answered: Aman standeth in the court, and the king said: Let him come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.6'>And when he was come in, he said to him: What ought to be done to the man whom the king is desirous to honour? But Aman thinking in his heart, and supposing that the king would honour no other but himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.7'>Answered: The man whom the king desireth to honour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.8'>Ought to be clothed with the king's apparel, and to be set upon the horse that the king rideth upon, and to have the royal crown upon his head,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.9'>And let the first of the king's princes and nobles hold his horse, and going through the street of the city, proclaim before him and say: Thus shall he be honoured, whom the king hath a mind to honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.10'>And the king said to him: Make haste and take the robe and the horse, and do as thou hast spoken to Mardochai the Jew, who sitteth before the gates of the palace. Beware thou pass over any of those things which thou hast spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.11'>So Aman took the robe and the horse, and arraying Mardochai in the street of the city, and setting him on the horse, went before him, and proclaimed: This honour is he worthy of, whom the king hath a mind to honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.12'>But Mardochai returned to the palace gate: and Aman made haste to go to his house, mourning and having his head covered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.13'>And he told Zares his wife, and his friends, all that had befallen him. And the wise men whom he had in counsel, and his wife answered him: If Mardochai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou canst not resist him, but thou shalt fall in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.14'>As they were yet speaking, the king's eunuchs came, and compelled him to go quickly to the banquet which the queen had prepared.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.7'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.1'>So the king and Aman went in, to drink with the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.2'>And the king said to her again the second day, after he was warm with wine: What is thy petition, Esther, that it may be granted thee? and what wilt thou have done: although thou ask the half of my kingdom, thou shalt have it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.3'>Then she answered: If I have found Favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please thee, give me my life for which I ask, and my people for which I request.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.4'>For we are given up, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. And would God we were sold for bondmen and bondwomen: the evil might be borne with, and I would have mourned in silence: but now we have an enemy, whose cruelty redoundeth upon the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.5'>And king Assuerus answered and said: Who is this, and of what power, that he should do these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.6'>And Esther said: It is this Aman that is our adversary and most wicked enemy. Aman hearing this was forthwith astonished, not being able to bear the countenance of the king and of the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.7'>But the king being angry rose up, and went from the place of the banquet into the garden set with trees. Aman also rose up to entreat Esther the queen for his life, for he understood that evil was prepared for him by the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.8'>And when the king came back out of the garden set with trees, and entered into the place of the banquet, he found Aman was fallen upon the bed on which Esther lay, and he said: He will force the queen also in my presence, in my own house. The word was not yet gone out of the king's mouth, and immediately they covered his face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.9'>And Harbona, one of the eunuchs that stood waiting on the king, said: Behold the gibbet which he hath prepared for Mardochai, who spoke for the king, standeth in Aman's house, being fifty cubits high. And the king said to him: Hang him upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.10'>So Aman was hanged on the gibbet, which he had prepared for Mardochai: and the king's wrath ceased.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.8'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.1'>On that day king Assuerus gave the house of Aman, the Jews' enemy, to queen Esther, and Mardochai came in before the king. For Esther had confessed to him that he was her uncle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.2'>And the king took the ring which he had commanded to be taken again from Aman, and gave it to Mardochai. And Esther set Mardochai over her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.3'>And not content with these things, she fell down at the king's feet and wept, and speaking to him besought him, that he would give orders that the malice of Aman the Agagite, and his most wicked devices which he had invented against the Jews, should be of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.4'>But he, as the manner was, held out the golden sceptre with his hand, which was the sign of clemency: and she arose up and stood before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.5'>And said: If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and my request be not disagreeable to him, I beseech thee, that the former letters of Aman the traitor and enemy of the Jews, by which he commanded that they should be destroyed in all the king's provinces, may be reversed by new letters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.6'>For how call I endure the murdering and slaughter of my people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.7'>And king Assuerus answered Esther the queen, and Mardochai the Jew: I have given Aman's house to Esther, and I have commanded him to be hanged on a gibbet, because he durst lay hands on the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.8'>Write ye therefore to the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king's name, and seal the letters with my ring. For this was the custom, that no man durst gainsay the letters which were sent in the king's name, and were sealed with his ring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.9'>Then the king's scribes and secretaries were called for (now it was the time of the third month which is called Siban) the three and twentieth day of the month, and letters were written, as Mardochai had a mind, to the Jews, and to the governors, and to the deputies, and to the judges, who were rulers over the hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia: to province and province, to people and people, according to their languages and characters, and to the Jews, according as they could read and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.10'>And these letters which were sent in the king's name, were sealed with his ring, and sent by posts: who were to run through all the provinces, to prevent the former letters with new messages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.11'>And the king gave orders to them, to speak to the Jews in every city, and to command them to gather themselves together, and to stand for their lives, and to kill and destroy all their enemies with their wives and children and all their houses, and to take their spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.12'>And one day of revenge was appointed through all the provinces, to wit, the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.13'>And this was the content of the letter, that it should be notified in all lands and peoples that were subject to the empire of king Assuerus, that the Jews were ready to be revenged of their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.14'>So the swift posts went out carrying the messages, and the king's edict was hung up in Susan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.15'>And Mardochai going forth out of the palace, and from the king's presence, shone in royal apparel, to wit, of violet and sky colour, wearing a golden crown on his head, and clothed with a cloak of silk and purple. And all the city rejoiced and was glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.16'>But to the Jews a new light seemed to rise, joy, honour, and dancing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.17'>And in all peoples, cities, and provinces, whithersoever the king's commandments came, there was wonderful rejoicing, feasts and banquets, and keeping holy day: insomuch that many of other nations and religion, joined themselves to their worship and ceremonies. For a great dread of the name of the Jews had fallen upon all.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.9'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.1'>So on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which as we have said above is called Adar, when all the Jews were designed to be massacred, and their enemies were greedy after their blood, the case being altered, the Jews began to have the upper hand, and to revenge themselves of their adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.2'>And they gathered themselves together in every city, and town, and place, to lay their hands on their enemies, and their persecutors. And no one durst withstand them, for the fear of their power had gone through every people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.3'>And the judges of the provinces, and the governors, and lieutenants, and every one in dignity, that presided over every place and work, extolled the Jews for fear of Mardochai:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.4'>For they knew him to be prince of the palace, and to have great power: and the fame of his name increased daily, and was spread abroad through all men's mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.5'>So the Jews made a great slaughter of their enemies, and killed them, repaying according to what they had prepared to do to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.6'>Insomuch that even in Susan they killed five hundred men, besides the ten sons of Aman the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews: whose names are these:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.7'>Pharsandatha, and Delphon, and Esphatha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.8'>And Phoratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.9'>And Phermesta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Jezatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.10'>And when they had slain them, they would not touch the spoils of their goods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.11'>And presently the number of them that were killed in Susan was brought to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.12'>And he said to the queen: The Jews have killed five hundred men in the city of Susan, besides the ten sons of Aman: how many dost thou think they have slain in all the provinces? What askest thou more, and what wilt thou have me to command to be done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.13'>And she answered: If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews, to do to morrow in Susan as they have done to day, and that the ten sons of Aman may be hanged upon gibbets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.14'>And the king commanded that it should be so done. And forthwith the edict was hung up in Susan, and the ten sons of Aman were hanged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.15'>,15And on the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews gathered themselves together, and they killed in Susan three hundred men: but they took not their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.16'>Moreover through all the provinces which were subject to the king's dominion the Jews stood for their lives, and slew their enemies and persecutors: insomuch that the number of them that were Billed amounted to seventy-five thousand, and no man took any of their goods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.17'>Now the thirteenth day of the month Adar was the first day with them all of the slaughter, and on the fourteenth day they left off. Which they ordained to be kept holy day, so that all times hereafter they should celebrate it with feasting, joy, and banquets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.18'>But they that were killing in the city of Susan, were employed in the slaughter on the thirteenth and fourteenth day of the same month: and on the fifteenth day they rested. And therefore they appointed that day to be a holy day of feasting and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.19'>But those Jews that dwelt in towns not walled and in villages, appointed the fourteenth day of the month Adar for banquets and gladness, so as to rejoice on that day, and send one another portions of their banquets and meats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.20'>And Mardochai wrote all these things, and sent them comprised in letters to the Jews that abode in all the king's provinces, both those that lay near and those afar off,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.21'>,21That they should receive the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the month Adar for holy days, and always at the return of the year should celebrate them with solemn honour:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.22'>Because on those days the Jews revenged themselves of their enemies, and their mourning and sorrow were turned into mirth and joy, and that these should be days of feasting and gladness, in which they should send one to another portions of meats; and should give gifts to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.23'>And the Jews undertook to observe with solemnity all they had begun to do at that time, which Mardochai by letters had commanded to be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.24'>For Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy and adversary of the Jews, had devised evil against them, to kill them and destroy them: and had cast Phur, that is, the lot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.25'>And afterwards Esther went in to the king, beseeching him that his endeavours might be made void by the king's letters: and the evil that he had intended against the Jews, might return upon his own head. And so both he and his sons were hanged upon gibbets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.26'>And since that time these days are called Phurim, that is, of lots: because Phur, that is, the lot, was cast into the urn. And all things that were done, are contained in the volume of this epistle, that is, of this book:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.27'>And the things that they suffered, and that were afterwards changed, the Jews took upon themselves and their seed, and upon all that had a mind to be joined to their religion, so that it should be lawful for none to pass these days without solemnity: which the writing testifieth, and certain times require, as the years continually succeed one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.28'>These are the days which shall never be forgot: and which all provinces in the whole world shall celebrate throughout all generations: neither is there any city wherein the days of Phurim, that is, of lots, must not be observed by the Jews, and by their posterity, which is bound to these ceremonies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.29'>And Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mardochai the Jew, wrote also a second epistle, that with all diligence this day should be established a festival for the time to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.30'>And they sent to all the Jews that were in the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of king Assuerus, that they should have peace, and receive truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.31'>And observe the days of lots, and celebrate them with joy in their proper time: as Mardochai and Esther had appointed, and they undertook them to be observed by themselves and by their seed, fasts, and cries, and the days of lots,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.32'>And all things which are contained in the history of this book, which is called Esther.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.10'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.1'>And king Assuerus made all the land, and all the islands of the sea tributary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.2'>And his strength and his empire, and the dignity and greatness wherewith he exalted Mardochai, are written in the books of the Medes, and of the Persians:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.3'>And how Mardochai of the race of the Jews, was next after king Assuerus: and great among the Jews, and acceptable to the people of his brethren, seeking the good of his people, and speaking those things which were for the welfare of his seed.</verse>
