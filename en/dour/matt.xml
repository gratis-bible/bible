      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham begot Isaac. And Isaac begot Jacob. And Jacob begot Judas and his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>And Judas begot Phares and Zara of Thamar. And Phares begot Esron. And Esron begot Aram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>And Aram begot Aminadab. And Aminadab begot Naasson. And Naasson begot Salmon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>And Salmon begot Booz of Rahab. And Booz begot Obed of Ruth. And Obed begot Jesse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>And Jesse begot David the king. And David the king begot Solomon, of her that had been the wife of Urias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>And Solomon begot Roboam. And Roboam begot Abia. And Abia begot Asa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>And Asa begot Josaphat. And Josaphat begot Joram. And Joram begot Ozias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>And Ozias begot Joatham. And Joatham begot Achaz. And Achaz begot Ezechias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>And Ezechias begot Manasses. And Manesses begot Amon. And Amon begot Josias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>And Josias begot Jechonias and his brethren in the transmigration of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the transmigration of Babylon, Jechonias begot Salathiel. And Salathiel begot Zorobabel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>And Zorobabel begot Abiud. And Abiud begot Eliacim. And Eliacim begot Azor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>And Azor begot Sadoc. And Sadoc begot Achim. And Achim begot Eliud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>And Eliud begot Eleazar. And Eleazar begot Mathan. And Mathan begot Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations, from Abraham to David, are fourteen generations. And from David to the transmigration of Babylon, are fourteen generations: and from the transmigration of Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the generation of Christ was in this wise. When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child, of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Whereupon Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing publicly to expose her, was minded to put her away privately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But while he thought on these things, behold the angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, saying: Joseph, son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her, is of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she shall bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name JESUS. For he shall save his people from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>Behold a virgin shall be with child, and bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>And Joseph rising up from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and took unto him his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>And he knew her not till she brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>When Jesus therefore was born in Bethlehem of Juda, in the days of king Herod, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>Saying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to adore him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>And king Herod hearing this, was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And assembling together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he inquired of them where Christ should be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>But they said to him: In Bethlehem of Juda. For so it is written by the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And thou Bethlehem the land of Juda art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come forth the captain that shall rule my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod, privately calling the wise men, learned diligently of them the time of the star which appeared to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And sending them into Bethlehem, said: Go and diligently inquire after the child, and when you have found him, bring me word again, that I also may come to adore him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>Who having heard the king, went their way; and behold the star which they had seen in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>And seeing the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And entering into the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and falling down they adored him; and opening their treasures, they offered him gifts; gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And having received an answer in sleep that they should not return to Herod, they went back another way into their country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>And after they were departed, behold an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph, saying: Arise, and take the child and his mother, and fly into Egypt: and be there until I shall tell thee. For it will come to pass that Herod will seek the child to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>Who arose, and took the child and his mother by night, and retired into Egypt: and he was there until the death of Herod:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>That it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet, saying: Out of Egypt have I called my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod perceiving that he was deluded by the wise men, was exceeding angry; and sending killed all the men children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>A voice in Rama was heard, lamentation and great mourning; Rachel bewailing her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But when Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>Saying: Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel. For they are dead that sought the life of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>Who arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But hearing that Archelaus reigned in Judea in the room of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither: and being warned in sleep retired into the quarters of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And coming he dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was said by prophets: That he shall be called a Nazarene.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>And in those days cometh John the Baptist preaching in the desert of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>And saying: Do penance: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he that was spoken of by Isaias the prophet, saying: A voice of one crying in the desert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>And the same John had his garment of camels' hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins: and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the country about Jordan:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>And were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them: Ye brood of vipers, who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of penance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father. For I tell you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doth not yield good fruit, shall be cut down, and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed baptize you in the water unto penance, but he that shall come after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor and gather his wheat into the barn; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan, unto John, to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John stayed him, saying: I ought to be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>And Jesus answering, said to him: Suffer it to be so now. For so it becometh us to fulfill all justice. Then he suffered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And Jesus being baptized, forthwith came out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened to him: and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And behold a voice from heaven, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led by the spirit into the desert, to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And the tempter coming said to him: If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>Who answered and said: It is written, Not in bread alone doth man live, but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil took him up into the holy city, and set him upon the pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>And said to him: If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written: That he hath given his angels charge over thee, and in their hands shall they bear thee up, lest perhaps thou dash thy foot against a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him: It is written again: Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again the devil took him up into a very high mountain, and shewed him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>And said to him: All these will I give thee, if falling down thou wilt adore me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus saith to him: Begone, Satan: for it is written, The Lord thy God shalt thou adore, and him only shalt thou serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left him; and behold angels came and ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>And when Jesus had heard that John was delivered up, he retired into Galilee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And leaving the city Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capharnaum on the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>That it might be fulfilled which was said by Isaias the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>Land of Zabulon and land of Nephthalim, the way of the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people that sat in darkness, hath seen great light: and to them that sat in the region of the shadow of death, light is sprung up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say: Do penance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishers).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he saith to them: Come ye after me, and I will make you to be fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And they immediately leaving their nets, followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets: and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>And they forthwith left their nets and father, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom: and healing all manner of sickness and every infirmity, among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And his fame went throughout all Syria, and they presented to him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and such as were possessed by devils, and lunatics, and those that had palsy, and he cured them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And much people followed him from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain, and when he was set down, his disciples came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>And opening his mouth, he taught them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed are the meek: for they shall possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after justice: for they shall have their fill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed are the clean of heart: for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blesses are the peacemakers: for they shall be called children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed are they that suffer persecution for justice' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Blessed are ye when they shall revile you, and persecute you, and speak all that is evil against you, untruly, for my sake:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Be glad and rejoice, for your reward is very great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets that were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt lose its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is good for nothing any more but to be cast out, and to be trodden on by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. A city seated on a mountain cannot be hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but upon a candlestick, that it may shine to all that are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Do not think that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets. I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For amen I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot, or one tittle shall not pass of the law, till all be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>He therefore that shall break one of these least commandments, and shall so teach men, shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But he that shall do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I tell you, that unless your justice abound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>You have heard that it was said to them of old: Thou shalt not kill. And whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say to you, that whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment. And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council. And whosoever shall say, Thou Fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>If therefore thou offer thy gift at the altar, and there thou remember that thy brother hath any thing against thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>Leave there thy offering before the altar, and go first to be reconciled to thy brother: and then coming thou shalt offer thy gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Be at agreement with thy adversary betimes, whilst thou art in the way with him: lest perhaps the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Amen I say to thee, thou shalt not go out from thence till thou repay the last farthing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>You have heard that it was said to them of old: Thou shalt not commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>And if thy right eye scandalize thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee. For it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish, rather than that thy whole body be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if thy right hand scandalize thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish, rather than that thy whole body be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>And it hath been said, Whoseoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say to you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, excepting for the cause of fornication, maketh her to commit adultery: and he that shall marry her that is put away, committeth adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Again you have heard that it was said to them of old, Thou shalt not forswear thyself: but thou shalt perform thy oaths to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I say to you not to swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool: nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your speech be yea, yea: no, no: and that which is over and above these, is of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>You have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say to you not to resist evil: but if one strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And if a man will contend with thee in judgment, and take away thy coat, let go thy cloak also unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And whosoever will force thee one mile, go with him other two,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to him that asketh of thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>You have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thy enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I say to you, Love your enemies: do good to them that hate you: and pray for them that persecute and calumniate you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>That you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven, who maketh his sun to rise upon the good, and bad, and raineth upon the just and the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>For if you love them that love you, what reward shall you have? do not even the publicans this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>And if you salute your brethren only, what do you more? do not also the heathens this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>Be you therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect.</verse>
      </chapter>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>Take heed that you do not your justice before men, to be seen by them: otherwise you shall not have a reward of your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>Therefore when thou dost an almsdeed, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be honoured by men. Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But when thou dost alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>That thy alms may be in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret will repay thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>And when ye pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, that love to stand and pray in the synagogues and corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men: Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But thou when thou shalt pray, enter into thy chamber, and having shut the door, pray to thy Father in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret will repay thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>And when you are praying, speak not much, as the heathens. For they think that in their much speaking they may be heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Be not you therefore like to them, for your Father knoweth what is needful for you, before you ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>Thus therefore shall you pray: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>Give us this day our supersubstantial bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.12'>And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.13'>And lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from evil. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.14'>For if you will forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father will forgive you also your offences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.15'>But if you will not forgive men, neither will your Father forgive you your offences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>And when you fast, be not as the hypocrites, sad. For they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.17'>But thou, when thou fastest anoint thy head, and wash thy face;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.18'>That thou appear not to men to fast, but to thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret, will repay thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.19'>Lay not up to yourselves treasures on earth: where the rust, and moth consume, and where thieves break through and steal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.20'>But lay up to yourselves treasures in heaven: where neither the rust nor moth doth consume, and where thieves do not break through, nor steal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.21'>For where thy treasure is, there is thy heart also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.22'>The light of thy body is thy eye. If thy eye be single, thy whole body shall be lightsome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.23'>But if thy eye be evil thy whole body shall be darksome. If then the light that is in thee, be darkness: the darkness itself how great shall it be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.24'>No man can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one, and love the other: or he will sustain the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>Therefore I say to you, be not solicitous for your life, what you shall eat, nor for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than the meat: and the body more than the raiment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.26'>Behold the birds of the air, for they neither sow, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns: and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not you of much more value than they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.27'>And which of you by taking thought, can add to his stature by one cubit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.28'>And for raiment why are you solicitous? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they labour not, neither do they spin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.29'>But I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.30'>And if the grass of the field, which is to day, and to morrow is cast into the oven, God doth so clothe: how much more you, O ye of little faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>Be not solicitous therefore, saying, What shall we eat: or what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we be clothed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.32'>For after all these things do the heathens seek. For your Father knoweth that you have need of all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.33'>Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of God, and his justice, and all these things shall be added unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>Be not therefore solicitous for to morrow; for the morrow will be solicitous for itself. Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.7'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.1'>Judge not, that you may not be judged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.2'>For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.3'>Any why seest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye; and seest not the beam that is in thy own eye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.4'>Or how sayest thou to thy brother: Let me cast the mote out of thy eye; and behold a beam is in thy own eye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.5'>Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam in thy own eye, and then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.6'>Give not that which is holy to dogs; neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turning upon you, they tear you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.7'>Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.8'>For every one that asketh, receiveth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.9'>Or what man is there among you, of whom if his son shall ask bread, will he reach him a stone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.10'>Or if he shall ask him a fish, will he reach him a serpent?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.11'>If you then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more will your Father who is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.12'>All things therefore whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you also to them. For this is the law and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.13'>Enter ye in at the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in thereat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.14'>How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to life: and few there are that find it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.15'>Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.16'>By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.17'>Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.18'>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.19'>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.20'>Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.21'>Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.22'>Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in thy name, and cast out devils in thy name, and done many miracles in thy name?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.23'>And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.24'>Every one therefore that heareth these my words, and doth them, shall be likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.25'>And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded on a rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.26'>And every one that heareth these my words, and doth them not, shall be like a foolish man that built his house upon the sand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.27'>And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.28'>And it came to pass when Jesus had fully ended these words, the people were in admiration at his doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.29'>For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes and Pharisees.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.8'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.1'>And when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.2'>And behold a leper came and adored him, saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>And Jesus stretching forth his hand, touched him, saying: I will, be thou made clean. And forthwith his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>And Jesus saith to him: See thou tell no man: but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded for a testimony unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>And when he had entered into Capharnaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, and is grieviously tormented.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>And Jesus saith to him: I will come and heal him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>And the centurion making answer, said: Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof: but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>For I also am a man subject to authority, having under me soldiers; and I say to this, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Come, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>And Jesus hearing this, marvelled; and said to them that followed him: Amen I say to you, I have not found so great faith in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>And I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.12'>But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>And Jesus said to the centurion: Go, and as thou hast believed, so be it done to thee. And the servant was healed at the same hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying, and sick of a fever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>And he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she arose and ministered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>And when evening was come, they brought to him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word: and all that were sick he healed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophet Isaias, saying: He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>And Jesus seeing great multitudes about him, gave orders to pass over the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>And a certain scribe came and said to him: Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou shalt go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>And Jesus saith to him: The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests: but the son of man hath not where to lay his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.21'>And another of his disciples said to him: Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.22'>But Jesus said to him: Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.23'>And when he entered into the boat, his disciples followed him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.24'>And behold a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat was covered with waves, but he was asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.25'>And they came to him, and awaked him, saying: Lord, save us, we perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>And Jesus saith to them: Why are you fearful, O ye of little faith? Then rising up he commanded the winds, and the sea, and there came a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>But the men wondered, saying: What manner of man is this, for the winds and the sea obey him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>And when he was come on the other side of the water, into the country of the Gerasens, there met him two that were possessed with devils, coming out of the sepulchres, exceeding fierce, so that none could pass by that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>And behold they cried out, saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>And there was, not far from them, an herd of many swine feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>And the devils besought him, saying: If thou cast us out hence, send us into the herd of swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>And he said to them: Go. But they going out went into the swine, and behold the whole herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea: and they perished in the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>And they that kept them fled: and coming into the city, told every thing, and concerning them that had been possessed by the devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>And behold the whole city went out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart from their coasts.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.9'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.1'>And entering into a boat, he passed over the water and came into his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.2'>And behold they brought to him one sick of the palsy lying in a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the man sick of the palsy: Be of good heart, son, thy sins are forgiven thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>And behold some of the scribes said within themselves: He blasphemeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>And Jesus seeing their thoughts, said: Why do you think evil in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.5'>Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee: or to say, Arise, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.6'>But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the man sick of palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>And he arose, and went into his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>And the multitude seeing it, feared, and glorified God that gave such power to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>And when Jesus passed on from hence, he saw a man sitting in the custom house, named Matthew; and he saith to him: Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>And it came to pass as he was sitting at meat in the house, behold many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples: Why doth your master eat with publicans and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>But Jesus hearing it, said: They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>Go then and learn what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For I am not come to call the just, but sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>Then came to him the disciples of John, saying: Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but thy disciples do not fast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>And Jesus said to them: Can the children of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>And nobody putteth a piece of raw cloth unto an old garment. For it taketh away the fullness thereof from the garment, and there is made a greater rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.17'>Neither do they put new wine into old bottles. Otherwise the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish. But new wine they put into new bottles: and both are preserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.18'>And he was speaking these things unto them, behold a certain ruler came up, and adored him, saying: Lord, my daughter is even now dead; but come, lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.19'>And Jesus rising up followed him, with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>And behold a woman who was troubled with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.21'>For she said within herself: If I shall touch only his garment, I shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.22'>But Jesus turning and seeing her, said: Be of good heart, daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.23'>And when Jesus was come into the house of the ruler, and saw the minstrels and the multitude making a rout,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.24'>He said: Give place, for the girl is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.25'>And when the multitude was put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand. And the maid arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.26'>And the fame hereof went abroad into all that country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.27'>And as Jesus passed from thence, there followed him two blind men crying out and saying, Have mercy on us, O Son of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.28'>And when he was come to the house, the blind men came to him. And Jesus saith to them, Do you believe, that I can do this unto you? They say to him, Yea, Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.29'>Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith, be it done unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.30'>And their eyes were opened, and Jesus strictly charged them, saying, See that no man know this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.31'>But they going out, spread his fame abroad in all that country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>And when they were gone out, behold they brought him a dumb man, possessed with a devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.33'>And after the devil was cast out, the dumb man spoke, and the multitudes wondered, saying, Never was the like seen in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.34'>But the Pharisees said, By the prince of devils he casteth out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.35'>And Jesus went about all the cities, and towns, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease, and every infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.36'>And seeing the multitudes, he had compassion on them: because they were distressed, and lying like sheep that have no shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.37'>Then he saith to his disciples, The harvest indeed is great, but the labourers are few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.38'>Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth labourers into his harvest.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.10.1'>And having called his twelve disciples together, he gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of diseases, and all manner of infirmities.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.30'>And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he paid the debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.31'>Now his fellow servants seeing what was done, were very much grieved, and they came and told their lord all that was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.32'>Then his lord called him; and said to him: Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all the debt, because thou besoughtest me:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For the poor you have always with you: but me you have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For she in pouring this ointment upon my body, hath done it for my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Amen I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memory of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then went one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>And said to them: What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you? But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>And on the first day of the Azymes, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the pasch?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>But Jesus said: Go ye into the city to a certain man, and say to him: the master saith, My time is near at hand, with thee I make the pasch with my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>And the disciples did as Jesus appointed to them, and they prepared the pasch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>But when it was evening, he sat down with his twelve disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>And whilst they were eating, he said: Amen I say to you, that one of you is about to betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>And they being very much troubled, began every one to say: Is it I, Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>But he answering, said: He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed: it were better for him, if that man had not been born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>And Judas that betrayed him, answering, said: Is it I, Rabbi? He saith to him: Thou hast said it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke: and gave to his disciples, and said: Take ye, and eat. This is my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>And taking the chalice, he gave thanks, and gave to them, saying: Drink ye all of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>And I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>And a hymn being said, they went out unto mount Olivet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then Jesus said to them: All you shall be scandalized in me this night. For it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be dispersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>And Peter answering, said to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, that in this night before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter saith to him: Yea, though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner said all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani; and he said to his disciples: Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful and to be sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death: stay you here, and watch with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And going a little further, he fell upon his face, praying, and saying: My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me. Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>And he cometh to his disciples, and findeth them asleep, and he saith to Peter: What? Could you not watch one hour with me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch ye, and pray that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again the second time, he went and prayed, saying: My Father, if this chalice may not pass away, but I must drink it, thy will be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping: for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>And leaving them, he went again: and he prayed the third time, saying the selfsame word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he cometh to his disciples, and saith to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest; behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Rise, let us go: behold he is at hand that will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>As he yet spoke, behold Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the ancients of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>And he that betrayed him, gave them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he, hold him fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said: Hail, Rabbi. And he kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>And Jesus said to him: Friend, whereto art thou come? Then they came up, and laid hands on Jesus, and held him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And behold one of them that were with Jesus, stretching forth his hand, drew out his sword: and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then Jesus saith to him: Put up again thy sword into its place: for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Thinkest thou that I cannot ask my Father, and he will give me presently more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that so it must be done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes: You are come out as it were to a robber with swords and clubs to apprehend me. I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you laid not hands on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>Now all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples all leaving him, fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>But they holding Jesus led him to Caiphas the high priest, where the scribes and the ancients were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>And Peter followed him afar off, even to the court of the high priest. And going in, he sat with the servants, that he might see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>And they found not, whereas many false witnesses had come in. And last of all there came two false witnesses:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>And they said: This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and after three days to rebuild it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And the high priest rising up, said to him: Answerest thou nothing to the things which these witness against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said to him: I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou be the Christ the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus saith to him: Thou hast said it. Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priests rent his garments, saying: He hath blasphemed; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What think you? But they answering, said: He is guilty of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him: and others struck his face with the palms of their hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>Saying: Prophesy unto us, O Christ, who is he that struck thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>But Peter sat without in the court: and there came to him a servant maid, saying: Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied before them all, saying: I know not what thou sayest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And as he went out of the gate, another maid saw him, and she saith to them that were there: This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>And after a little while they came that stood by, and said to Peter: Surely thou also art one of them; for even thy speech doth discover thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he had said: Before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And going forth, he wept bitterly.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>And when morning was come, all the chief priests and ancients of the people took counsel against Jesus, that they might put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>And they brought him bound, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and ancients,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>Saying: I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said: What is that to us? look thou to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed: and went and hanged himself with an halter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>But the chief priests having taken the pieces of silver, said: It is not lawful to put them into the corbona, because it is the price of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>For this cause the field was called Haceldama, that is, The field of blood, even to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was prized, whom they prized of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>And they gave them unto the potter's field, as the Lord appointed to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? Jesus saith to him: Thou sayest it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>And when he was accused by the chief priests and ancients, he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate saith to him: Dost not thou hear how great testimonies they allege against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>And he answered him to never a word; so that the governor wondered exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now upon the solemn day the governor was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner, whom they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>And he had then a notorious prisoner, that was called Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said: Whom will you that I release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus that is called Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>And as he was sitting in the place of judgment, his wife sent to him, saying: Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the chief priests and ancients persuaded the people, that they should ask Barabbas, and make Jesus away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>And the governor answering, said to them: Whether will you of the two to be released unto you? But they said, Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate saith to them: What shall I do then with Jesus that is called Christ? They say all: Let him be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>The governor said to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying: Let him be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>And Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult was made; taking water washed his hands before the people, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this just man; look you to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>And the whole people answering, said: His blood be upon us and our children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him unto them to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus into the hall, gathered together unto him the whole band;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. And bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying: Hail, king of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And spitting upon him, they took the reed, and struck his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they forced to take up his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall. And when he had tasted, he would not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And after they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And they sat and watched him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And they put over his head his cause written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then were crucified with him two thieves: one on the right hand, and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>And they that passed by, blasphemed him, wagging their heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>And saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days dost rebuild it: save thy own self: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients, mocking, said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusted in God; let him now deliver him if he will have him; for he said: I am the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>And the selfsame thing the thieves also, that were crucified with him, reproached him with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole earth, until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>And some that stood there and heard, said: This man calleth Elias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>And immediately one of them running took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar; and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>And the others said: Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top even to the bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>And the graves were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, came into the holy city, and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake, and the things that were done, were sore afraid, saying: Indeed this was the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>And there were there many women afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>Among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>And when it was evening, there came a certain rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>He went to Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body should be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>And Joseph taking the body, wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>And laid it in his own new monument, which he had hewed out in a rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the monument, and went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>And there was there Mary Magdalen, and the other Mary sitting over against the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>And the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>Saying: Sir, we have remembered, that that seducer said, while he was yet alive: After three days I will rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Command therefore the sepulchre to be guarded until the third day: lest perhaps his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the people: He is risen from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate saith to them: You have a guard; go, guard it as you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>And they departing, made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting guards.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>And in the end of the sabbath, when it began to dawn towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalen and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And behold there was a great earthquake. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and coming, rolled back the stone, and sat upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>And his countenance was as lightning, and his raiment as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>And for fear of him, the guards were struck with terror, and became as dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>And the angel answering, said to the women: Fear not you; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come, and see the place where the Lord was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>And going quickly, tell ye his disciples that he is risen: and behold he will go before you into Galilee; there you shall see him. Lo, I have foretold it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And they went out quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy, running to tell his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And behold Jesus met them, saying: All hail. But they came up and took hold of his feet, and adored him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them: Fear not. Go, tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, there they shall see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>Who when they were departed, behold some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all things that had been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>And they being assembled together with the ancients, taking counsel, gave a great sum of money to the soldiers,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>And seeing them they adored: but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And Jesus coming, spoke to them, saying: All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>Going therefore, teach ye all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and behold I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world.</verse>
