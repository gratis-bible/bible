  <div type='book' osisID='1Cor'>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes a brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>To the church of God that is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, in every place of theirs and ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I give thanks to my God always for you, for the grace of God that is given you in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>That in all things you are made rich in him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>As the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>So that nothing is wanting to you in any grace, waiting for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>Who also will confirm you unto the end without crime, in the day of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful: by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you; but that you be perfect in the same mind, and in the same judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it hath been signified unto me, my brethren, of you, by them that are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>Now this I say, that every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am of Apollo; and I am of Cephas; and I of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is Christ divided? Was Paul then crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I give God thanks, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>And I baptized also the household of Stephanus; besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness; but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the prudence of the prudent I will reject.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>For both the Jews require signs, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles foolishness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For see your vocation, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the wise; and the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>And the base things of the world, and the things that are contemptible, hath God chosen, and things that are not, that he might bring to nought things that are:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>That no flesh should glory in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and justice, and sanctification, and redemption:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>That, as it is written: He that glorieth, may glory in the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in shewing of the Spirit and power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory :</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>Which none of the princes of this world knew; for if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But, as it is written: That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But to us God hath revealed them, by this Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of God no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God; that we may know the things that are given us from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>Which things also we speak, not in the learned words of human wisdom; but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God; for it is foolishness to him, and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But the spiritual man judgeth all things; and he himself is judged of no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that we may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. As unto little ones in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I gave you milk to drink, not meat; for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able; for you are yet carnal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal, and walk according to man ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For while one saith, I indeed am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollo; are you not men ? What then is Apollo, and what is Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>The ministers of him whom you have believed; and to every one as the Lord hath given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Now he that planteth, and he that watereth, ate one. And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are God's coadjutors: you are God's husbandry; you are God's building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid; which is Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>Every man's work shall be manifest; for the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire; and the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If any man's work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If any man's work burn, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Know you not, that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>But if any man violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no man deceive himself: if any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: I will catch the wise in their own craftiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>And again: The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Let no man therefore glory in men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>For all things are yours, whether it be Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to some; for all are yours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ, and the dispensers of the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Here now it is required among the dispensers, that a man be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you, or by man's day; but neither do I judge my own self.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For I am not conscious to myself of any thing, yet am I not hereby justified; but he that judgeth me, is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore judge not before the time; until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have praise from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>But these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo, for your sakes; that in us you may learn, that one be not puffed up against the other for another, above that which is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who distinguisheth thee ? Or what hast thou that thou hast not received ? And if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>You are now full; you are now become rich; you reign without us; and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as it were men appointed to death: we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honourable, but we without honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no fixed abode;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>And we labour, working with our own hands: we are reviled, and we bless; we are persecuted, and we suffer it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>We are blasphemed, and we entreat; we are made as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all even until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I write not these things to confound you; but I admonish you as my dearest children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have begotten you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my dearest son and faithful in the Lord; who will put you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ Jesus; as I teach every where in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>As if I would not come to you, so some are puffed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will: and will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What will you ? shall I come to you with a rod; or in charity, and in the spirit of meekness ?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is absolutely heard, that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as the like is not among the heathens; that one should have his father's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you are puffed up; and have not rather mourned, that he might be taken away from among you, that hath done this deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>I indeed, absent in body, but present in spirit, have already judged, as though I were present, him that hath so done,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our pasch is sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>Therefore let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote to you in an epistle, not to keep company with fornicators.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>I mean not with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or the extortioners, or the servers of idols; otherwise you must needs go out of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But now I have written to you, not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or a server of idols, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such a one, not so much as to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what have I to do to judge them that are without ? Do not you judge them that are within ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>For them that are without, God will judge. Put away the evil one from among yourselves.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to be judged before the unjust, and not before the saints ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Know you not that the saints shall judge this world ? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Know you not that we shall judge angels ? how much more things of this world ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world, set them to judge, who are the most despised in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not among you any one wise man, that is able to judge between his brethren ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>But you do wrong and defraud, and that to your brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>Nor the effeminate, nor liers with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners, shall possess the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And such some of you were; but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Meat for the belly, and the belly for the meats; but God shall destroy both it and them: but the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>Now God hath both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up also by his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot ? God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Or know you not, that he who is joined to a harlot, is made one body ? For they shall be, saith he, two in one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But he who is joined to the Lord, is one spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Fly fornication. Every sin that a man doth, is without the body; but he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Or know you not, that your members are the temple of the Holy Ghost, who is in you, whom you have from God; and you are not your own ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>For you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning the thing whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>Let the husband render the debt to his wife, and the wife also in like manner to the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband. And in like manner the husband also hath not power of his own body, but the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Defraud not one another, except, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you may give yourselves to prayer; and return together again, lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But I speak this by indulgence, not by commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>For I would that all men were even as myself: but every one hath his proper gift from God; one after this manner, and another after that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>But I say to the unmarried, and to the widows: It is good for them if they so continue, even as I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>But if they do not contain themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be burnt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>But to them that are married, not I but the Lord commandeth, that the wife depart not from her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>And if she depart, that she remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>For to the rest I speak, not the Lord. If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she consent to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.19'>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing: but the observance of the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>Wast thou called, being a bondman ? care not for it; but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>And this I speak for your profit: not to cast a snare upon you; but for that which is decent, and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured, with regard to his virgin, for that she is above the age, and it must so be: let him do what he will; he sinneth not, if she marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>For he that hath determined being steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power of his own will; and hath judged this in his heart, to keep his virgin, doth well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>Therefore, both he that giveth his virgin in marriage, doth well; and he that giveth her not, doth better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband die, she is at liberty: let her marry to whom she will; only in the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.19'>And if they all were one member, where would be the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>But now there are many members indeed, yet one body.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>If I speak with the tongues of men, and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries, and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely; is not puffed up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh no evil;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But, when I became a man, I put away the things of a child.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Follow after charity, be zealous for spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For he that speaketh in a tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man heareth. Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But he that prophesieth, speaketh to men unto edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He that speaketh in a tongue, edifieth himself: but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>And I would have you all to speak with tongues, but rather to prophesy. For greater is he that prophesieth, than he that speaketh with tongues: unless perhaps he interpret, that the church may receive edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in doctrine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is said ? For you shall be speaking into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in this world; and none is without voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>If then I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him to whom I speak a barbarian; and he that speaketh, a barbarian to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>So you also, forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto the edifying of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is without fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>Else if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that holdeth the place of the unlearned say, Amen, to thy blessing ? because he knoweth not what thou sayest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For thou indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank my God I speak with all your tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also; than ten thousand words in a tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brethren, do not become children in sense: but in malice be children, and in sense be perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the law it is written: In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; but prophecies not to unbelievers, but to believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>If therefore the whole church come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons or infidels, will they not say that you are mad ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or an unlearned person, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>The secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among you indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>How is it then, brethren ? When you come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation: let all things be done to edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in course, and let one interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the church, and speak to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>And let the prophets speak, two or three; and let the rest judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>But if any thing be revealed to another sitting, let the first hold his peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For you may all prophesy one by one; that all may learn, and all may be exhorted:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also I teach in all the churches of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be subject, as also the law saith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>But if they would learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>Or did the word of God come out from you ? Or came it only unto you ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If any seem to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him know the things that I write to you, that they are the commandments of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if any man know not, he shall not be known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy; and forbid not to speak with tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>But let all things be done decently, and according to order.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Now I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>By which also you are saved, if you hold fast after what manner I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For I delivered unto you first of all, which I also received: how that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>And that he was seen by Cephas; and after that by the eleven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>Then he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once: of whom many remain until this present, and some are fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>After that, he was seen by James, then by all the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>And last of all, he was seen also by me, as by one born out of due time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God, I am what I am; and his grace in me hath not been void, but I have laboured more abundantly than all they: yet not I, but the grace of God with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>For whether I, or they, so we preach, and so you have believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>Now if Christ be preached, that he arose again from the dead, how do some among you say, that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>And if Christ be not risen again, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God: because we have given testimony against God, that he hath raised up Christ; whom he hath not raised up, if the dead rise not again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead rise not again, neither is Christ risen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain, for you are yet in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ, are perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But now Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruits of them that sleep :</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For by a man came death, and by a man the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But every one in his own order: the firstfruits Christ, then they that are of Christ, who have believed in his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>Afterwards the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father, when he shall have brought to nought all principality, and power, and virtue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For he must reign, until he hath put all his enemies under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>And the enemy death shall be destroyed last: For he hath put all things under his feet. And whereas he saith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>All things are put under him; undoubtedly, he is excepted, who put all things under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then the Son also himself shall be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Otherwise what shall they do that are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not again at all? why are they then baptized for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>Why also are we in danger every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>I die daily, I protest by your glory, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>If (according to man) I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me, if the dead rise not again? Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Be not seduced: Evil communications corrupt good manners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Awake, ye just, and sin not. For some have not the knowledge of God, I speak it to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But some man will say: How do the dead rise again? or with what manner of body shall they come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>Senseless man, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be; but bare grain, as of wheat, or of some of the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>But God giveth it a body as he will: and to every seed its proper body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>All flesh is not the same flesh: but one is the flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, another of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>And there are bodies celestial, and bodies terrestrial: but, one is the glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>One is the glory of the sun, another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars. For star differeth from star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it shall rise in incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>It is sown in dishonour, it shall rise in glory. It is sown in weakness, it shall rise in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>It is sown a natural body, it shall rise a spiritual body. If there be a natural body, there is also a spiritual body, as it is written:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>The first man Adam was made into a living soul; the last Adam into a quickening spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>Yet that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; afterwards that which is spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man was of the earth, earthly: the second man, from heaven, heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>Such as is the earthly, such also are the earthly: and such as is the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>Therefore as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot possess the kingdom of God: neither shall corruption possess incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall all indeed rise again: but we shall not all be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise again incorruptible: and we shall be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For this corruptible must put on incorruption; and this mortal must put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>And when this mortal hath put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>Now the sting of death is sin: and the power of sin is the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast and unmoveable; always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</verse>
