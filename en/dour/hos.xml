      <chapter osisID='Hos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.1'>The word of the Lord, that came to Osee the son of Beeri, in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias kings of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joas king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.2'>The beginning of the Lord's speaking by Osse: and the Lord said to Osee: Go, take thee a wife of fornications, and have of her children of fornications: for the land by fornication shall depart from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.3'>So he went, and took Gomer the daughter of Debelaim: and she conceived and bore him a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.4'>And the Lord said to him: Call his name Jezrahel: for yet a little while, and I will visit the blood of Jezrahel upon the house of Jehu, and I will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.5'>And in that day I will break in pieces the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezrahel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.6'>And she conceived again, and bore a daughter, and he said to him: Call her name, Without mercy: for I will not add any more to have mercy on the house of Israel, but I will utterly forget them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.7'>And I will have mercy on the house of Juda, and I will save them by the Lord their God: and Iwill not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.8'>And she weaned her that was called Without mercy. And she conceived, and bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.9'>And he said: Call his name, Not my people: for you are not my people, and I will not be yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.10'>And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, that is without measure, and shall not be numbered. And it shall be in the place where it shall be said to them: You are not my people: it shall be said to them: Ye are the sons of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.11'>And the children of Juda, and the children of Israel shall be gathered together: and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall come up out of the land: for great is the day of Jezrahel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.1'>Say ye to your brethren: You are my people, and to your sister: Thou hast obtained mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.2'>Judge your mother, judge her: because she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her put away her fornications from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.3'>Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born: and I will make her as a wilderness, and will set her as a land that none can pass through, and will kill her with drought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.4'>And I will not have mercy on her children: for they are the children of fornications.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.5'>For their mother hath committed fornication, she that conceived them is covered with shame: for she said: I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread, and my water, my wool, and my flax, my oil, and my drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.6'>Wherefore behold I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will stop it up with a wall, and she shall not find her paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.7'>And she shall follow after her lovers, and shall not overtake them: and she shall seek them, and shall not find, and she shall say: I will go, and return to my first husband, because it was better with me then, than now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.8'>And she did not know that I gave her corn and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver, and gold, which they have used in the service of Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.9'>Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in its season, and my wine in its season, and I will set at liberty my wool, and my flax, which covered her disgrace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.10'>And now I will lay open her folly in the eyes of her lovers: and no man shall deliver her out of my hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.11'>And I will cause all her mirth to cease, her solemnities, her new moons, her sabbaths, and all her festival times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.12'>And I will destroy her vines, and her fig trees, of which she said: These are my rewards, which my lovers have given me: and I will make her as a forest, and the beasts of the field shall devour her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.13'>And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, to whom she burnt incense, and decked herself out with her earrings, and with her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.14'>Therefore, behold I will allure her, and will lead her into the wilderness: and I will speak to her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.15'>And I will give her vinedressers out of the same place, and the valley of Achor for an opening of hope: and she shall sing there according to the days of her youth, and according to the days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.16'>And it shall be in that day, saith the Lord, That she shall call me : My husband, and she shall call me no more Baali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.17'>And I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and she shall no more remember their name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.18'>And in that day I will make a covenant with them, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of the air, and with the creeping things of the earth: and I will destroy the bow, and the sword, and war out of the land: and I will make them sleep secure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.19'>And I will espouse thee to me for ever: and I will espouse thee to me in justice, and judgment, and in mercy, and in commiserations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.20'>And I will espouse thee to me in faith: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.21'>And it shall come to pass in that day: I will hear, saith the Lord, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.22'>And the earth shall hear the core, and the wine, and the oil, and these shall hear Jezrahel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.23'>And I will sow her unto me in the earth, and I will have mercy on her that was without mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.24'>And I will say to that which was not my people: Thou art my people: and they shall say: Thou art my God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.1'>And the Lord said to me: Go yet again, and love a woman beloved of her friend, and an adulteress : as the Lord loveth the children of Israel, and they look to strange gods, and love the husks of the grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.2'>And I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for a core of barley, and for half a core of barley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.3'>And I said to her: Thou shalt wait for me many days: thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt be no man's, and I also will wait for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.4'>For the children of Israel shall sit many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without altar, and without ephod, and without theraphim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.5'>And after this the children of Israel shall return, and shall seek the Lord their God, and David their king: and they shall fear the Lord, and his goodness in the last days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.1'>Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel, for the Lord shall enter into judgment with the inhabitants of the land: for there is no truth, and there is no mercy, and there is no knowledge of God in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.2'>Cursing, and lying, and killing, and theft, and adultery have overflowed, and blood hath touched blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.3'>Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth in it shall languish with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of the air: yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.4'>But yet let not any man judge: and let not a man be rebuked: for thy people are as they that contradict the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.5'>And thou shalt fall to day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee: in the night I have made thy mother to be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.6'>My people have been silent, because they had no knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will reject thee, that thou shalt not do the office of priesthood to me: and thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.7'>According to the multitude of them so have they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.8'>They shall eat the sins of my people, and shall lift up their souls to their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.9'>And there shall be like people like priest: and I will visit their ways upon them, and I will repay them their devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.10'>And they shall eat and shall not be filled: they have committed fornication, and have not ceased: because they have forsaken the Lord in not observing his law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.11'>Fornication, and wine, and drunkenness take away the understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.12'>My people have consulted their stocks, and their staff hath declared unto them: for the spirit of fornication hath deceived them, and they have committed fornication against their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.13'>They offered sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burnt incense upon the hills: under the oak, and the poplar, and the turpentine tree, because the shadow thereof was good: therefore shall your daughters commit fornication, and your spouses shall be adulteresses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.14'>I will not visit upon your daughters when they shell commit fornication, and upon your spouses when they shall commit adultery: because themselves conversed with harlots, and offered sacrifice with the effeminate, and the people that doth not understand shall be beaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.15'>If thou play the harlot, O Israel, at least let not Juda offend: and go ye not into Galgal, and come not up into Bethaven, and do not swear: The Lord liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.16'>For Israel hath gone astray like a wanton heifer: now will the Lord feed them, as a lamb in a spacious place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.17'>Ephraim is a partaker with idols, let him alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.18'>Their banquet is separated, they have gone astray by fornication: they that should have protected them have loved to bring shame upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.19'>The wind hath bound them up in its wings, and they shall be confounded because of their sacrifices.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.1'>Hear ye this, O priests, and hearken, O ye house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king: for there is a judgment against you, because you have been a snare to them whom you should have watched over, and a net spread upon Thabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.2'>And you have turned aside victims into the depth: and I am, the teacher of them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.3'>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now Ephraim hath committed fornication, Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.4'>They will not set their thoughts to return to their God: for the spirit of fornication is in the midst of them, and they have not known the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.5'>And the pride of Israel shall answer in his face: and Israel and Ephraim shall fall in their iniquity, Juda also shall fall with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.6'>With their flocks, and with their herds, they shall go to seek the Lord, and shall not find him: he is withdrawn from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.7'>They have transgressed against the Lord, for they have begotten children that are strangers: now shall a month devour them with their portions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.8'>Blow ye the cornet in Gabaa, the trumpet in Rama: howl ye in Bethaven, behind thy back, O Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.9'>Ephraim shall be in desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel I have shewn that which shall surely be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.10'>The princes of Juda are become as they that take up the bound: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.11'>Ephraim is under oppression, and broken in judgment: because he began to go after filthiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.12'>And I will be like a moth to Ephraim: and like rottenness to the house of Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.13'>And Ephraim saw his sickness, and Juda his band: and Ephraim went to the Assyrian, and sent to the avenging king: and he shall not be able to heal you, neither shall he be able to take off the band from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.14'>For I will be like a lioness to Ephraim, and like a lion's whelp to the house of Juda: I, I will catch, and go: I will take away, and there is none that can rescue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.15'>I will go and return to my place: until you are consumed, and seek my face.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.1'>In their affliction they will rise early to me: Come, and let us return to the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.2'>For he hath taken us, and he will heal us: he will strike, and he will cure us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.3'>He will revive us after two days: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. We shall know, and we shall follow on, that we may know the Lord. His going forth is prepared as the morning light, and he will come to us as the early and the latter rain to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.4'>What shall I do to thee, O Ephraim? what shall I do to thee, O Juda? your mercy is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth away in the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.5'>For this reason have I hewed them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments shall go forth as the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.6'>For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice: and the knowledge of God more than holocausts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.7'>But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant, there have they dealt treacherously against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.8'>Galaad is a city of workers of idols, supplanted with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.9'>And like the jaws of highway robbers, they conspire with the priests who murder in the way those that pass out Sichem: for they have wrought wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.10'>I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: the fornications of Ephraim there: Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.11'>And thou also, O Juda, set thee a harvest, when I shall bring back captivity of my people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.1'>When I would have healed Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria, for they have committed falsehood, and the thief is come in to steal, the robber is without.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.2'>And lest they may say in their hearts, that I remember all their wickedness: their own devices now have beset them about, they have been done before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.3'>They have made the king glad with their wickedness: and the princes with their lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.4'>They are all adulterers, like an oven heated by the baker: the city rested a little from the mingling of the leaven, till the whole was leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.5'>The day of our king, the princes began to be mad with wine: he stretched out his hand with scorners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.6'>Because they have applied their heart like an oven, when he laid snares for them: he slept all the night baking them, in the morning he himself was heated as a flaming fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.7'>They were all heated like an oven, and have devoured their judges : all their kings have fallen: there is none amongst them that calleth unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.8'>Ephraim himself is mixed among the nations: Ephraim is become as bread baked under the ashes, that is not turned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.9'>Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knew it not: yea, grey hairs also are spread about upon him, and he is ignorant of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.10'>And the pride of Israel shall be humbled before his face: and they have not returned to the Lord their God, nor have they sought him in all these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.11'>And Ephraim is become as a dove that is decoyed, not having a heart: they called upon Egypt, they went to the Assyrians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.12'>And when they shall go, I will spread my net upon them: I will bring them down as the fowl of the air, I will strike them as their congregation hath heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.13'>Woe to them, for they have departed from me: they shall be wasted because they have transgressed against me: and I redeemed them : and they have spoken lies against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.14'>And they have not cried to me with their heart, but they howled in their beds: they have thought upon wheat and wine, they are departed from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.15'>And I have chastised them, and strengthened their arms: and they have imagined evil against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.16'>They returned, that they might be without yoke: they became like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword, for the rage of their tongue. This is their derision in the land of Egypt.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.1'>Let there be a trumpet in thy throat like an eagle upon the house of the Lord: because they have transgressed my covenant, and have violated my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.2'>They shall call upon me: O my God, we, Israel, know thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.3'>Israel hath cast off the thing that is good, the enemy shall pursue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.4'>They have reigned, but not by me: they have been princes, and I knew not: of their silver, and their gold they have made idols to themselves, that they might perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.5'>Thy calf, O Samaria, is cast off, my wrath is kindled against them. How long will they be incapable of being cleansed ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.6'>For itself also is the invention of Israel: a workman made it, and it is no god: for the calf of Samaria shall be turned to spiders' webs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.7'>For they shall sow wind, and reap a whirlwind, there is no standing stalk in it, the bud shall yield no meal; end if it should yield, strangers shall eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.8'>Israel is swallowed up: now is he become among the nations like an unclean vessel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.9'>For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath given gifts to his lovers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.10'>But even though they shall have hired the nations, now will I gather them together: and they shall rest a while from the burden of the king, and the princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.11'>Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin: altars are become to him unto sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.12'>I shall write to him my manifold laws, which have been accounted as foreign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.13'>They shall offer victims, they shall sacrifice flesh, and shall eat it, and the Lord will not receive them: now will he remember their iniquity, and will visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.14'>And Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and hath built temples: and Juda hath built many fenced cities: and I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the houses thereof.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.9'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.1'>Rejoice not, O Israel: rejoice not as the nations do: for thou hast committed fornication against thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.2'>The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the wine shall deceive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.3'>They shall not dwell in the Lord's land: Ephraim is returned to Egypt, and hath eaten unclean things among the Assyrians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.4'>They shall not offer wine to the Lord, neither shall they please him: their sacrifices shall be like the bread of mourners: all that shall eat it shall be defiled: for their bread is life for their soul, it shall not enter into the house of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.5'>What will you do in the solemn day, in the day of the feast of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.6'>For behold they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them together, Memphis shall bury them: nettles shall inherit their beloved silver, the bur shall be in their tabernacles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.7'>The days of visitation are come, the days of repaying are come: know ye, O Israel, that the prophet was foolish, the spiritual man was mad, for the multitude of thy iniquity, and the multitude of thy madness.</verse>
