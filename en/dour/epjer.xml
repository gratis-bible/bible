      <chapter osisID='EpJer.1'>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.1'>Tobias of the tribe and city of Nephtali, (which is in the upper parts of Galilee above Naasson, beyond the way that leadeth to the west, having on the right hand the city of Sephet,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.2'>When he was made captive in the days of Salmanasar king of the Assyrians, even in his captivity, forsook not the way of truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.3'>But every day gave all he could get to his brethren his fellow captives, that were of his kindred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.4'>And when he was younger than any of the tribe of Nephtali, yet did he no childish thing in his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.5'>Moreover when all went to the golden calves which Jeroboam king of Israel had made, he alone fled the company of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.6'>And went to Jerusalem to the temple of the Lord, and there adored the Lord God of Israel, offering faithfully all his firstfruits, and his tithes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.7'>So that in the third year he gave all his tithes to the proselytes, and strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.8'>These and such like things did he observe when but a boy according to the law of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.9'>But when he was a man, he took to wife Anna of his own tribe, and had a son by her, whom he called after his own name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.10'>And from his infancy he taught him to fear God, and to abstain from all sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.11'>And when by the captivity he with his wife and his son and all his tribe was come to the city of Ninive,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.12'>(When all ate of the meats of the Gentiles) he kept his soul and never was defiled with their meats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.13'>And because he was mindful of the Lord with all his heart, God gave him favour in the sight of Salmanasar the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.14'>And he gave him leave to go whithersoever he would, with liberty to do whatever he had a mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.15'>He therefore went to all that were in captivity, and gave them wholesome admonitions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.16'>And when he was come to Rages a city of the Medes, and had ten talents of silver of that with which he had been honoured by the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.17'>And when amongst a great multitude of his kindred, he saw Gabelus in want, who was one of his tribe, taking a note of his hand he gave him the aforesaid sum of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.18'>But after a long time, Salmanasar the king being dead, when Sennacherib his son, who reigned in his place, had a hatred for the children of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.19'>Tobias daily went among all his kindred, and comforted them, and distributed to every one as he was able, out of his goods:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.20'>He fed the hungry, and gave clothes to the naked, and was careful to bury the dead, and they that were slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.21'>And when king Sennacherib was come back, fleeing from Judea by reason of the slaughter that God had made about him for his blasphemy, and being angry slew many of the children of Israel, Tobias buried their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.22'>But when it was told the king, he commanded him to be slain, and took away all his substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.23'>But Tobias fleeing naked away with his son and with his wife, lay concealed, for many loved him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.24'>But after forty-five days, the king was killed by his own sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.1.25'>And Tobias returned to his house, and all his substance was restored to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='EpJer.2'>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.1'>But after this, when there was a festival of the Lord, and a good dinner was prepared in Tobias's house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.2'>He said to his son: Go, and bring some of our tribe that fear God, to feast with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.3'>And when he had gone, returning he told him, that one of the children of Israel lay slain in the street. And he forthwith leaped up from his place at the table, and left his dinner, and came fasting to the body:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.4'>And taking it up carried it privately to his house, that after the sun was down, he might bury him cautiously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.5'>And when he had hid the body, he ate bread with mourning and fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.6'>Remembering the word which the Lord spoke by Amos the prophet: Your festival days shall be turned into lamentation and mourning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.7'>So when the sun was down, he went and buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.8'>Now all his neighbours blamed him, saying: Once already commandment was given for thee to be slain because of this matter, and thou didst scarce escape the sentence of death, and dost thou again bury the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.9'>But Tobias fearing God more than the king, carried off the bodies of them that were slain, and hid them in his house, and at midnight buried them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.10'>Now it happened one day, that being wearied with burying, he came to his house, and cast himself down by the wall and slept,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.11'>And as he was sleeping, hot dung out of a swallow's nest fell upon his eyes, and he was made blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.12'>Now this trial the Lord therefore permitted to happen to him, that an example might be given to posterity of his patience, as also of holy Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.13'>For whereas he had always feared God from his infancy, and kept his commandments, he repined not against God because the evil of blindness had befallen him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.14'>But continued immoveable in the fear of God, giving thanks to God all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.15'>For as the kings insulted over holy Job: so his relations and kinsmen mocked at his life, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.16'>Where is thy hope, for which thou gavest alms, and buriedst the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.17'>But Tobias rebuked them, saying: Speak not so:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.18'>For we are the children of the saints, and look for that life which God will give to those that never change their faith from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.19'>Now Anna his wife went daily to weaving work, and she brought home what she could get for their living by the labour of her hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.20'>Whereby it came to pass, that she received a young kid, and brought it home:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.21'>And when her husband heard it bleating, he said: Take heed, lest perhaps it be stolen: restore ye it to its owners, for it is not lawful for us either to eat or to touch any thing that cometh by theft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.22'>At these words his wife being angry answered: It is evident thy hope is come to nothing, and thy alms now appear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.2.23'>And with these, and other such like words she upbraided him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='EpJer.3'>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.1'>Then Tobias sighed, and began to pray with tears,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.2'>Saying: Thou art just, O Lord, and all thy judgments are just, and all thy ways mercy, and truth, and judgment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.3'>And now, O Lord, think of me, and take not revenge of my sins, neither remember my offenses, nor those of my parents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.4'>For we have not obeyed thy commandments, therefore are we delivered to spoil and to captivity, and death, and are made a fable, and a reproach to all nations, amongst which thou hast scattered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.5'>And now, O Lord, great are thy judgments, because we have not done according to thy precepts, and have not walked sincerely before thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.6'>And now, O Lord, do with me according to thy will, and command my spirit to be received in peace: for it is better for me to die, than to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.7'>Now it happened on the same day, that Sara daughter of Raguel, in Rages a city of the Medes, received a reproach from one of her father's servant maids,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.8'>Because she had been given to seven husbands, and a devil named Asmodeus had killed them, at their first going in unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.9'>So when she reproved the maid for her fault, she answered her, saying: May we never see son, or daughter of thee upon the earth, thou murderer of thy husbands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.10'>Wilt thou kill me also, as thou hast already killed seven husbands? At these words she went into an upper chamber of her house: and for three days and three nights did neither eat nor drink:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.11'>But continuing in prayer with tears besought God, that he would deliver her from this reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.12'>And it came to pass on the third day, when she was making an end of her prayer, blessing the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.13'>She said: Blessed is thy name, O God of our fathers: who when thou hast been angry, wilt shew mercy, and in the time of tribulation forgivest the sins of them that call upon thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.14'>To thee, O Lord, I turn my face, to thee I direct my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.15'>I beg, O Lord, that thou loose me from the bond of this reproach, or else take me away from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.16'>Thou knowest, O Lord, that I never coveted a husband, and have kept my soul clean from all lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.17'>Never have I joined myself with them that play: neither have I made myself partaker with them that walk in lightness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.18'>But a husband I consented to take, with thy fear, not with my lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.19'>And either I was unworthy of them, or they perhaps were not worthy of me: because perhaps thou hast kept me for another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.20'>For thy counsel is not in man's power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.21'>But this every one is sure of that worshippeth thee, that his life, if it be under trial, shall be crowned: and if it be under tribulation, it shall be delivered: and if it be under correction, it shall be allowed to come to thy mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.22'>For thou art not delighted in our being lost: because after a storm thou makest a calm, and after tears and weeping thou pourest in joyfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.23'>Be thy name, O God of Israel, blessed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.24'>At that time the prayers of them both were heard in the sight of the glory of the most high God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.3.25'>And the holy angel of the Lord, Raphael was sent to heal them both, whose prayers at one time were rehearsed in the sight of the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='EpJer.4'>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.1'>Therefore when Tobias thought that his prayer was heard that he might die, he called to him Tobias his son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.2'>And said to him: Hear, my son, the words of my mouth, and lay them as a foundation in thy heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.3'>When God shall take my soul, thou shalt bury my body: and thou shalt honour thy mother all the days of her life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.4'>For thou must be mindful what and how great perils she suffered for thee in her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.5'>And when she also shall have ended the time of her life, bury her by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.6'>And all the days of thy life have God in thy mind: and take heed thou never consent to sin, nor transgress the commandments of the Lord our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.7'>Give alms out of thy substance, and turn not away thy face from any poor person: for so it shall come to pass that the face of the Lord shall not be turned from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.8'>According to thy ability be merciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.9'>If thou have much give abundantly: if thou have a little, take care even so to bestow willingly a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.10'>For thus thou storest up to thyself a good reward for the day of necessity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.11'>For alms deliver from all sin, and from death, and will not suffer the soul to go into darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.12'>Alms shall be a great confidence before the most high God, to all them that give it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.13'>Take heed to keep thyself, my son, from all fornication, and beside thy wife never endure to know a crime.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.14'>Never suffer pride to reign in thy mind, or in thy words: for from it all perdition took its beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.15'>If any man hath done any work for thee, immediately pay him his hire, and let not the wages of thy hired servant stay with thee at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.16'>See thou never do to another what thou wouldst hate to have done to thee by another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.17'>Eat thy bread with the hungry and the needy, and with thy garments cover the naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.18'>Lay out thy bread, and thy wine upon the burial of a just man, and do not eat and drink thereof with the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.19'>Seek counsel always of a wise man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.20'>Bless God at all times: and desire of him to direct thy ways, and that all thy counsels may abide in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.21'>I tell thee also, my son, that I lent ten talents of silver, while thou wast yet a child, to Gabelus, in Rages a city of the Medes, and I have a note of his hand with me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.22'>Now therefore inquire how thou mayst go to him, and receive of him the foresaid sum of money, and restore to him the note of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.4.23'>Fear not, my son: we lead indeed a poor life, but we shall have many good things if we fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='EpJer.5'>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.1'>Then Tobias answered his father, and said: I will do all things, father, which thou hast commanded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.2'>But how I shall get this money, I cannot tell; he knoweth me not, and I know not him: what token shall I give him? nor did I ever know the way which leadeth thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.3'>Then his father answered him, and said: I have a note of his hand with me, which when thou shalt shew him, he will presently pay it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.4'>But go now, and seek thee out some faithful man, to go with thee for his hire: that thou mayst receive it, while I yet live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.5'>Then Tobias going forth, found a beautiful young man, standing girded, and as it were ready to walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.6'>And not knowing that he was an angel of God, he saluted him, and said: From whence art thou, good young man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.7'>But he answered: Of the children of Israel. And Tobias said to him: Knowest thou the way that leadeth to the country of the Medes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.8'>And he answered: I know it: and I have often walked through all the ways thereof, and I have abode with Gabelus our brother, who dwelleth at Rages a city of the Medes, which is situate in the mount of Ecbatana.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.9'>And Tobias said to him: Stay for me, I beseech thee, till I tell these same things to my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.10'>Then Tobias going in told all these things to his father. Upon which his father being in admiration, desired that he would come in unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.11'>So going in he saluted him, and said: Joy be to thee always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.12'>And Tobias said: What manner of joy shall be to me, who sit in darkness, and see not the light of heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.13'>And the young man said to him: Be of good courage, thy cure from God is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.14'>And Tobias said to him: Canst thou conduct my son to Gabelus at Rages, a city of the Medes? and when thou shalt return, I will pay thee thy hire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.15'>And the angel said to him: I will conduct him thither, and bring him back to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.16'>And Tobias said to him: I pray thee, tell me, of what family, or what tribe art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.17'>And Raphael the angel answered: Dost thou seek the family of him thou hirest, or the hired servant himself to go with thy son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.18'>But lest I should make thee uneasy, I am Azarias the son of the great Ananias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.19'>And Tobias answered: Thou art of a great family. But I pray thee be not angry that I desired to know thy family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.20'>And the angel said to him: I will lead thy son safe, and bring him to thee again safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.21'>And Tobias answering, said: May you have a good journey, and God be with you in your way, and his angel accompany you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.22'>Then all things being ready, that were to be carried in their journey, Tobias bade his father and his mother farewell, and they set out both together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.23'>And when they were departed, his mother began to weep, and to say: Thou hast taken the staff of our old age, and sent him away from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.24'>I wish the money for which thou hast sent him, had never been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.25'>For poverty was sufficient for us, that we might account it as riches, that we saw our son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.26'>And Tobias said to her: Weep not, our son will arrive thither safe, and will return safe to us, and thy eyes shall see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.27'>For I believe that the good angel of God doth accompany him, and doth order all things well that are done about him, so that he shall return to us with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.5.28'>At these words his mother ceased weeping, and held her peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='EpJer.6'>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.1'>And Tobias went forward, and the dog followed him, and he lodged the first night by the river of Tigris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.2'>And he went out to wash his feet, and behold a monstrous fish came up to devour him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.3'>And Tobias being afraid of him, cried out with a loud voice, saying: Sir, he cometh upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.4'>And the angel said to him: Take him by the gill, and draw him to thee. And when he had done so, he drew him out upon the land, and he began to pant before his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.5'>Then the angel said to him: Take out the entrails of the fish, and lay up his heart, and his gall, and his liver for thee: for these are necessary for useful medicines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.6'>And when he had done so, he roasted the flesh thereof, and they took it with them in the way: the rest they salted as much as might serve them, till they came to Rages the city of the Medes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.7'>Then Tobias asked the angel, and said to him: I beseech thee, brother Azarias, tell me what remedies are these things good for, which thou hast bid me keep of the fish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.8'>And the angel, answering, said to him: If thou put a little piece of its heart upon coals, the smoke thereof driveth away all kind of devils, either from man or from woman, so that they come no more to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.9'>And the gall is good for anointing the eyes, in which there is a white speck, and they shall be cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.10'>And Tobias said to him: Where wilt thou that we lodge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.11'>And the angel answering, said: Here is one whose name is Raguel, a near kinsman of thy tribe, and he hath a daughter named Sara, but he hath no son nor any other daughter beside her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.12'>All his substance is due to thee, and thou must take her to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.13'>Ask her therefore of her father, and he will give her thee to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.14'>Then Tobias answered, and said: I hear that she hath been given to seven husbands, and they all died: moreover I have heard, that a devil killed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.15'>Now I am afraid, lest the same thing should happen to me also: and whereas I am the only child of my parents, I should bring down their old age with sorrow to hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.16'>Then the angel Raphael said to him: Hear me, and I will shew thee who they are, over whom the devil can prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.17'>For they who in such manner receive matrimony, as to shut out God from themselves, and from their mind, and to give themselves to their lust, as the horse and mule, which have not understanding, over them the devil hath power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.18'>But thou when thou shalt take her, go into the chamber, and for three days keep thyself continent from her, and give thyself to nothing else but to prayers with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.19'>And on that night lay the liver of the fish on the fire, and the devil shall be driven away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.20'>But the second night thou shalt be admitted into the society of the holy Patriarchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.21'>And the third night thou shalt obtain a blessing that sound children may be born of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.6.22'>And when the third night is past, thou shalt take the virgin with the fear of the Lord, moved rather for love of children than for lust, that in the seed of Abraham thou mayst obtain a blessing in children.</verse>

        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.1'>And they went in to Raguel, and Raguel received them with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.2'>And Raguel looking upon Tobias, said to Anna his wife: How like is this young man to my cousin?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.3'>And when he had spoken these words, he said: Whence are ye young men our brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.4'>But they said: We are of the tribe of Nephtali, of the captiveof Ninive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.5'>And Raguel said to them: Do you know Tobias my brother? And they said: We know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.6'>And when he was speaking many good things of him, the angel said to Raguel: Tobias concerning whom thou inquirest is this young man's father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.7'>And Raguel went to him, and kissed him with tears, and weeping upon his neck, said: A blessing be upon thee, my son, because thou art the son of a good and most virtuous man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.8'>And Anna his wife, and Sara their daughter wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.9'>And after they had spoken, Raguel commanded a sheep to be killed, and a feast to be prepared. And when he desired them to sit down to dinner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.10'>Tobias said: I will not eat nor drink here this day, unless thou first grant me my petition, and promise to give me Sara thy daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.11'>Now when Raguel heard this he was afraid, knowing what had happened to those seven husbands, that went in unto her: and he began to fear lest it might happen to him also in like manner: and as he was in suspense, and gave no answer to his petition,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.12'>The angel said to him: Be not afraid to give her to this man, for to him who feareth God is thy daughter due to be his wife: therefore another could not have her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.13'>Then Raguel said: I doubt not but God hath regarded my prayers and tears in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.14'>And I believe he hath therefore made you come to me, that this maid might be married to one of her own kindred, according to the law of Moses: and now doubt not but I will give her to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.15'>And taking the right hand of his daughter, he gave it into the right hand of Tobias, saying: The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob be with you, and may he join you together, and fulfil his blessing in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.16'>And taking paper they made a writing of the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.17'>And afterwards they made merry, blessing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.18'>And Raguel called to him Anna his wife, and bade her prepare another chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.7.19'>And she brought Sara her daughter in thither, and she wept.</verse>

        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.1'>And after they had supped, they brought in the young man to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.2'>And Tobias remembering the angel's word, took out of his bag part of the liver, and laid it upon burning coals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.3'>Then the angel Raphael took the devil, and bound him in the desert of upper Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.4'>Then Tobias exhorted the virgin, and said to her: Sara, arise, and let us pray to God to day, and to morrow, and the next day: because for these three nights we are joined to God: and when the third night is over, we will be in our own wedlock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.5'>For we are the children of saints, and we must not be joined together like heathens that know not God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.6'>So they both arose, and prayed earnestly both together that health might be given them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.7'>And Tobias said: Lord God of our father, may the heavens and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains, and the rivers, and all thy creatures that are in them, bless thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.8'>Thou madest Adam of the slime of the earth, and gavest him Eve for a helper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.9'>And now, Lord, thou knowest, that not for fleshly lust do I take my sister to wife, but only for the love of posterity, in which thy name may be blessed for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.10'>Sara also said: Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us, and let us grow old both together in health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.11'>And it came to pass about the cockcrowing, Raguel ordered his servants to be called for, and they went with him together to dig a grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.12'>For he said: Lest perhaps it may have happened to him, in like manner as it did to the other seven husbands, that went in unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.13'>And when they had prepared the pit, Raguel went back to his wife, and said to her:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.14'>Send one of thy maids, and let her see if he be dead, that I may bury him before it be day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.15'>So she sent one of her maidservants, who went into the chamber, and found them safe and sound, sleeping both together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.16'>And returning she brought the good news: and Raguel and Anna his wife blessed the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.17'>And said: We bless thee, O Lord God of Israel, because it hath not happened as we suspected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.18'>For thou hast shewn thy mercy to us, and hast shut out from us the enemy that persecuted us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.19'>And thou hast taken pity upon two only children. Make them, O Lord, bless thee more fully: and to offer up to thee a sacrifice of thy praise, and of their health, that all nations may know, that thou alone art God in all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.20'>And immediately Raguel commanded his servants, to fill up the pit they had made, before it was day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.21'>And he spoke to his wife to make ready a feast, and prepare all kind of provisions that are necessary for such as go a journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.22'>He caused also two fat kine, and four wethers to be killed, and a banquet to be prepared for all his neighbours, and all his friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.23'>And Raguel adjured Tobias, to abide with him two weeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.8.24'>And of all things which Raguel possessed, he gave one half to Tobias, and made him a writing, that the half that remained should after their decease come also to Tobias.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='EpJer.9'>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.9.1'>Then Tobias called the angel to him, whom he took to be a man, and said to him: Brother Azarias, I pray thee hearken to my words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.9.2'>If I should give myself to be thy servant I should not make a worthy return for thy care.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.9.3'>However, I beseech thee, to take with thee beasts and servants, and to go to Gabelus to Rages the city of the Medes: and to restore to him his note of hand, and receive of him the money, and desire him to come to my wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.9.4'>For thou knowest that my father numbereth the days: and if I stay one day more, his soul will be afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.9.5'>And indeed thou seest how Raguel hath adjured me, whose adjuring I cannot despise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.9.6'>Then Raphael took four of Raguel's servants, and two camels, and went to Rages the city of the Medes: and finding Gabelus, gave him his note of hand, and received of him all the money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.9.7'>And he told him concerning Tobias the son of Tobias, all that had been done: and made him come with him to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.9.8'>And when he was come into Raguel's house he found Tobias sitting at the table: and he leaped up, and they kissed each other: and Gabelus wept, and blessed God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.9.9'>And said: The God of Israel bless thee, because thou art the son of a very good and just man, and that feareth God, and doth almsdeeds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.9.10'>And may a blessing come upon thy wife and upon your parents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.9.11'>And may you see your children, and your children's children, unto the third and fourth generation: and may your seed be blessed by the God of Israel, who reigneth for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.9.12'>And when all had said, Amen, they went to the feast: but the marriage feast they celebrated also with the fear of the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='EpJer.10'>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.10.1'>But as Tobias made longer stay upon occasion of the marriage, Tobias his father was solicitous, saying: Why thinkest thou doth my son tarry, or why is he detained there?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.10.2'>Is Gabelus dead, thinkest thou, and no man will pay him the money?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.10.3'>And he began to be exceeding sad, both he and Anna his wife with him: and they began both to weep together: because their son did not return to them on the day appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.10.4'>But his mother wept and was quite disconsolate, and said: Woe, woe is me, my son; why did we send thee to go to a strange country, the light of our eyes, the staff of our old age, the comfort of our life, the hope of our posterity?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.10.5'>We having all things together in thee alone, ought not to have let thee go from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.10.6'>And Tobias said to her: Hold thy peace, and be not troubled, our son is safe: that man with whom we sent him is very trusty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.10.7'>But she could by no means be comforted, but daily running out looked round about, and went into all the ways by which there seemed any hope he might return, that she might if possible see him coming afar off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.10.8'>But Raguel said to his son in law: Stay here, and I will send a messenger to Tobias thy father, that thou art in health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.10.9'>And Tobias said to him: I know that my father and mother now count the days, and their spirit is grievously afflicted within them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.10.10'>And when Raguel had pressed Tobias with many words, and he by no means would hearken to him, he delivered Sara unto him, and half of all his substance in menservants, and womenservants, in cattle, in camels, and in kine, and in much money, and sent him away safe and joyful from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.10.11'>Saying: The holy angel of the Lord be with you in your journey, and bring you through safe, and that you may find all things well about your parents, and my eyes see your children before I die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.10.12'>And the parents taking their daughter kissed her, and let her go:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.10.13'>Admonishing her to honour her father and mother in law, to love her husband, to take care of the family, to govern the house, and to behave herself irreprehensibly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='EpJer.11'>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.1'>And as they were returning they came to Charan, which is in the midway to Ninive, the eleventh day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.2'>And the angel said: Brother Tobias, thou knowest how thou didst leave thy father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.3'>If it please thee therefore, let us go before, and let the family follow softly after us, together with thy wife, and with the beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.4'>And as this their going pleased him, Raphael said to Tobias: Take with thee of the gall of the fish, for it will be necessary. So Tobias took some of that gall and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.5'>But Anna sat beside the way daily, on the top of a hill, from whence she might see afar off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.6'>And while she watched his coming from that place, she saw him afar off, and presently perceived it was her son coming: and returning she told her husband, saying: Behold thy son cometh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.7'>And Raphael said to Tobias: As soon as thou shalt come into thy house, forthwith adore the Lord thy God: and giving thanks to him, go to thy father, and kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.8'>And immediately anoint his eyes with this gall of the fish, which thou carriest with thee. For be assured that his eyes shall be presently opened, and thy father shall see the light of heaven, and shall rejoice in the sight of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.9'>Then the dog, which had been with them in the way, ran before, and coming as if he had brought the news, shewed his joy by his fawning and wagging his tail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.10'>And his father that was blind, rising up, began to run stumbling with his feet: and giving a servant his hand, went to meet his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.11'>And receiving him kissed him, as did also his wife, and they began to weep for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.12'>And when they had adored God, and given him thanks, they sat down together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.13'>Then Tobias taking of the gall of the fish, anointed his father's eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.14'>And he stayed about half an hour: and a white skin began to come out of his eyes, like the skin of an egg.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.15'>And Tobias took hold of it, and drew it from his eyes, and immediately he recovered his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.16'>And they glorified God, both he and his wife and all that knew them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.17'>And Tobias said: I bless thee, O Lord God of Israel, because thou hast chastised me, and thou hast saved me: and behold I see Tobias my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.18'>And after seven days Sara his son's wife, and all the family arrived safe, and the cattle, and the camels, and an abundance of money of his wife's: and that money also which he had received of Gabelus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.19'>And he told his parents all the benefits of God, which he had done to him by the man that conducted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.20'>And Achior and Nabath the kinsmen of Tobias came, rejoicing for Tobias, and congratulating with him for all the good things that God had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.11.21'>And for seven days they feasted and rejoiced all with great joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='EpJer.12'>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.1'>Then Tobias called to him his son, and said to him: What can we give to this holy man, that is come with thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.2'>Tobias answering, said to his father: Father, what wages shall we give him? or what can be worthy of his benefits?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.3'>He conducted me and brought me safe again, he received the money of Gabelus, he caused me to have my wife, and he chased from her the evil spirit, he gave joy to her parents, myself he delivered from being devoured by the fish, thee also he hath made to see the light of heaven, and we are filled with all good things through him. What can we give him sufficient for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.4'>But I beseech thee, my father, to desire him, that he would vouchsafe to accept one half of all things that have been brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.5'>So the father and the son, calling him, took him aside: and began to desire him that he would vouchsafe to accept of half of all things that they had brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.6'>Then he said to them secretly: Bless ye the God of heaven, give glory to him in the sight of all that live, because he hath shewn his mercy to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.7'>For it is good to hide the secret of a king: but honourable to reveal and confess the works of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.8'>Prayer is good with fasting and alms more than to lay up treasures of gold:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.9'>For alms delivereth from death, and the same is that which purgeth away sins, and maketh to find mercy and life everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.10'>But they that commit sin and iniquity, are enemies to their own soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.11'>I discover then the truth unto you, and I will not hide the secret from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.12'>When thou didst pray with tears, and didst bury the dead, and didst leave thy dinner, and hide the dead by day in thy house, and bury them by night, I offered thy prayer to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.13'>And because thou wast acceptable to God, it was necessary that temptation should prove thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.14'>And now the Lord hath sent me to heal thee, and to deliver Sara thy son's wife from the devil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.16'>And when they had heard these things, they were troubled, and being seized with fear they fell upon the ground on their face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.17'>And the angel said to them: Peace be to you, fear not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.18'>For when I was with you, I was there by the will of God: bless ye him, and sing praises to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.19'>I seemed indeed to eat and to drink with you: but I use an invisible meat and drink, which cannot be seen by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.12.20'>It is time therefore that I return to him that sent me: but bless ye God, and publish all his wonderful works.</verse>

        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.1'>And the words of Tobias were ended. And after Tobias was restored to his sight, he lived two and forty years, and saw the children of his grandchildren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.2'>And after he had lived a hundred and two years, he was buried honourably in Ninive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.3'>For he was six and fifty years old when he lost the sight of his eyes, and sixty when he recovered it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.4'>And the rest of his life was in joy, and with great increase of the fear of God he departed in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.5'>And at the hour of his death he called unto him his son Tobias and his children, seven young men, his grandsons, and said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.6'>The destruction of Ninive is at hand: for the word of the Lord must be fulfilled: and our brethren, that are scattered abroad from the land of Israel, shall return to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.7'>And all the land thereof that is desert shall be filled with people, and the house of God which is burnt in it, shall again be rebuilt: and all that fear God shall return thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.8'>And the Gentiles shall leave their idols, and shall come into Jerusalem, and shall dwell in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.9'>And all the kings of the earth shall rejoice in it, adoring the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.10'>Hearken therefore, my children, to your father: serve the Lord in truth, and seek to do the things that please him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.11'>And command your children that they do justice and almsdeeds, and that they be mindful of God, and bless him at all times in truth, and with all their power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.12'>And now, children, hear me, and do not stay here: but as soon as you shall bury your mother by me in one sepulchre, without delay direct your steps to depart hence:</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.13'>For I see that its iniquity will bring it to destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.14'>And it came to pass that after the death of his mother, Tobias departed out of Ninive with his wife, and children, and children's children, and returned to his father and mother in law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.15'>And he found them in health in a good old age: and he took care of them, and he closed their eyes: and all the inheritance of Raguel's house came to him: and he saw his children's children to the fifth generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.16'>And after he had lived ninety-nine years in the fear of the Lord, with joy they buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='EpJer.14.17'>And all his kindred, and all his generation continued in good life, and in holy conversation, so that they were acceptable both to God, and to men, and to all that dwelt in the land.</verse>
