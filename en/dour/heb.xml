      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>God, who, at sundry times and in divers manners, spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets, last of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>In these days hath spoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>Who being the brightness of his glory, and the figure of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, making purgation of sins, sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the angels hath he said at any time, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith: And let all the angels of God adore him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>And to the angels indeed he saith: He that maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And: Thou in the beginning, O Lord, didst found the earth: and the works of thy hands are the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They shall perish, but thou shalt continue: and they shall all grow old as a garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the selfsame, and thy years shall not fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>But to which of the angels said he at any time: Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them, who shall receive the inheritance of salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>Therefore ought we more diligently to observe the things which we have heard, lest perhaps we should let them slip.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the word, spoken by angels, became steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? which having begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>God also bearing them witness by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and distributions of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For God hath not subjected unto angels the world to come, whereof we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>But one in a certain place hath testified, saying: What is man, that thou art mindful of him: or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels: thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, and hast set him over the works of thy hands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>Thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in that he hath subjected all things to him, he left nothing not subject to him. But now we see not as yet all things subject to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour: that, through the grace of God, he might taste death for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, who had brought many children into glory, to perfect the author of their salvation, by his passion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For both he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one. For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the church will I praise thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again: I will put my trust in him. And again: Behold I and my children, whom God hath given me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Therefore because the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same: that, through death, he might destroy him who had the empire of death, that is to say, the devil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>And might deliver them, who through the fear of death were all their lifetime subject to servitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For no where doth he take hold of the angels: but of the seed of Abraham he taketh hold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful priest before God, that he might be a propitiation for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>For in that, wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted, he is able to succour them also that are tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation, consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>Who is faithful to him that made him, as was also Moses in all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>For this man was counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by so much as he that hath built the house, hath greater honour than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For every house is built by some man: but he that created all things, is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>But Christ as the Son in his own house: which house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and glory of hope unto the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith: To day if you shall hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation; in the day of temptation in the desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>Where your fathers tempted me, proved and saw my works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this generation, and I said: They always err in heart. And they have not known my ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Take heed, brethren, lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called to day, that none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we are made partakers of Christ: yet so, if we hold the beginning of his substance firm unto the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>While it is said, To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in that provocation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with them that sinned, whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest: but to them that were incredulous?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>And we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Let us fear therefore lest the promise being left of entering into his rest, any of you should be thought to be wanting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For unto us also it hath been declared, in like manner as unto them. But the word of hearing did not profit them, not being mixed with faith of those things they heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>For we, who have believed, shall enter into rest; as he said: As I have sworn in my wrath; If they shall enter into my rest; and this indeed when the works from the foundation of the world were finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For in a certain place he spoke of the seventh day thus: And God rested the seventh day from all his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>And in this place again: If they shall enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Seeing then it remaineth that some are to enter into it, and they, to whom it was first preached, did not enter because of unbelief:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>Again he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time, as it is above said: To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Jesus had given them rest, he would never have afterwards spoken of another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>There remaineth therefore a day of rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For he that is entered into his rest, the same also hath rested from his works, as God did from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest; lest any man fall into the same example of unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the word of God is living and effectual, and more piercing than any two edged sword; and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit, of the joints also and the marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>Neither is there any creature invisible in his sight: but all things are naked and open to his eyes, to whom our speech is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Having therefore a great high priest that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God: let us hold fast our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we have not a high priest, who can not have compassion on our infirmities: but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace: that we may obtain mercy, and find grace in seasonable aid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in the things that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and sacrifices for sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a high priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>As he saith also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death, was heard for his reverence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things which he suffered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause of eternal salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>Called by God a high priest according to the order of Melchisedech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>Of whom we have much to say, and hard to be intelligibly uttered: because you are become weak to hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God: and you are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>For every one that is a partaker of milk, is unskillful in the word of justice: for he is a little child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But strong meat is for the perfect; for them who by custom have their senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Wherefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us go on to things more perfect, not laying again the foundation of penance from dead works, and of faith towards God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>Of the doctrine of baptisms, and imposition of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And this will we do, if God permit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated, have tasted also the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>Have moreover tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>And are fallen away: to be renewed again to penance, crucifying again to themselves the Son of God, and making him a mockery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For the earth that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is tilled, receiveth blessing from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>But that which bringeth forth thorns and briers, is reprobate, and very near unto a curse, whose end is to be burnt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But, my dearly beloved, we trust better things of you, and nearer to salvation; though we speak thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work, and the love which you have shewn in his name, you who have ministered, and do minister to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>And we desire that every one of you shew forth the same carefulness to the accomplishing of hope unto the end:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>That you become not slothful, but followers of them, who through faith and patience shall inherit the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For God making promise to Abraham, because he had no one greater by whom he might swear, swore by himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>Saying: Unless blessing I shall bless thee, and multiplying I shall multiply thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For men swear by one greater than themselves: and an oath for confirmation is the end of all their controversy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>Wherein God, meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed an oath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>That by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have the strongest comfort, who have fled for refuge to hold fast the hope set before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>Which we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, and which entereth in even within the veil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>Where the forerunner Jesus is entered for us, made a high priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchisedech was king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>To whom also Abraham divided the tithes of all: who first indeed by interpretation, is king of justice: and then also king of Salem, that is, king of peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened unto the Son of God, continueth a priest for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>Now consider how great this man is, to whom also Abraham the patriarch gave tithes out of the principal things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And indeed they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is to say, of their brethren: though they themselves also came out of the loins of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But he, whose pedigree is not numbered among them, received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>And without all contradiction, that which is less, is blessed by the better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>And here indeed, men that die, receive thithes: but there he hath witness, that he liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>And (as it may be said) even Levi who received tithes, paid tithes in Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedech met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>If then perfection was by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchisedech, and not be called according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For the priesthood being translated, it is necessary that a translation also be made of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For he, of whom these things are spoken, is of another tribe, of which no one attended on the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is evident that our Lord sprung out of Juda: in which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And it is yet far more evident: if according to the similitude of Melchisedech there ariseth another priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>Who is made not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an indissoluble life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For he testifieth: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>There is indeed a setting aside of the former commandment, because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>(For the law brought nothing to perfection,) but a bringing in of a better hope, by which we draw nigh to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And inasmuch as it is not without an oath, (for the others indeed were made priests without an oath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>But this with an oath, by him that said unto him: The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>By so much is Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>And the others indeed were made many priests, because by reason of death they were not suffered to continue:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>But this, for that he continueth for ever, hath an everlasting priesthood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Whereby he is able also to save for ever them that come to God by him; always living to make intercession for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>Who needeth not daily (as the other priests) to offer sacrifices first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, in offering himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the law maketh men priests, who have infirmity: but the word of the oath, which was since the law, the Son who is perfected for evermore.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>A minister of the holies, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>If then he were on earth, he would not be a priest: seeing that there would be others to offer gifts according to the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things. As it was answered to Moses, when he was to finish the tabernacle: See (saith he) that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee on the mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also he is a mediator of a better testament, which is established on better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if that former had been faultless, there should not indeed a place have been sought for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For finding fault with them, he saith: Behold, the days shall come, saith the Lord: and I will perfect unto the house of Israel, and unto the house of Juda, a new testament:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in my testament: and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my laws into their mind, and in their heart will I write them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me from the least to the greatest of them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>Because I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins I will remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>Now in saying a new, he hath made the former old. And that which decayeth and groweth old, is near its end.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>The former indeed had also justifications of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For there was a tabernacle made the first, wherein were the candlesticks, and the table, and the setting forth of loaves, which is called the holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>And after the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called the holy of holies:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>Having a golden censer, and the ark of the testament covered about on every part with gold, in which was a golden pot that had manna, and the rod of Aaron, that had blossomed, and the tables of the testament.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>And over it were the cherubims of glory overshadowing the propitiatory: of which it is not needful to speak now particularly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests indeed always entered, accomplishing the offices of sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>But into the second, the high priest alone, once a year: not without blood, which he offereth for his own, and the people's ignorance:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>The Holy Ghost signifying this, that the way into the holies was not yet made manifest, whilst the former tabernacle was yet standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>Which is a parable of the time present: according to which gifts and sacrifices are offered, which can not, as to the conscience, make him perfect that serveth, only in meats and in drinks,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>And divers washings, and justices of the flesh laid on them until the time of correction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But Christ, being come an high priest of the good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, that is, not of this creation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>Neither by the blood of goats, or of calves, but by his own blood, entered once into the holies, having obtained eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of an heifer being sprinkled, sanctify such as are defiled, to the cleansing of the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And therefore he is the mediator of the new testament: that by means of his death, for the redemption of those trangressions, which were under the former testament, they that are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where there is a testament, the death of the testator must of necessity come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For a testament is of force, after men are dead: otherwise it is as yet of no strength, whilst the testator liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Whereupon neither was the first indeed dedicated without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For when every commandment of the law had been read by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>Saying: This is the blood of the testament, which God hath enjoined unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry, in like manner, he sprinkled with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>And almost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood: and without shedding of blood there is no remission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>It is necessary therefore that the patterns of heavenly things should be cleansed with these: but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For Jesus is not entered into the holies made with hands, the patterns of the true: but into heaven itself, that he may appear now in the presence of God for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holies, every year with the blood of others:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>For then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of the world: but now once at the end of ages, he hath appeared for the destruction of sin, by the sacrifice of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>So also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many; the second time he shall appear without sin to them that expect him unto salvation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For the law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things; by the selfsame sacrifices which they offer continually every year, can never make the comers thereunto perfect:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>For then they would have ceased to be offered: because the worshippers once cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith: Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldest not: but a body thou hast fitted to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>Holocausts for sin did not please thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then said I: Behold I come: in the head of the book it is written of me: that I should do thy will, O God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>In saying before, Sacrifices, and oblations, and holocausts for sin thou wouldest not, neither are they pleasing to thee, which are offered according to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>Then said I: Behold, I come to do thy will, O God: he taketh away the first, that he may establish that which followeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>In the which will, we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And every priest indeed standeth daily ministering, and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But this man offering one sacrifice for sins, for ever sitteth on the right hand of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>From henceforth expecting, until his enemies be made his footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by one oblation he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>And the Holy Ghost also doth testify this to us. For after that he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>And this is the testament which I will make unto them after those days, saith the Lord. I will give my laws in their hearts, and on their minds will I write them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>Now where there is a remission of these, there is no more an oblation for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Having therefore, brethren, a confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>A new and living way which he hath dedicated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>And a high priest over the house of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>Let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with clean water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering (for he is faithful that hath promised),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>And let us consider one another, to provoke unto charity and to good works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>Not forsaking our assembly, as some are accustomed; but comforting one another, and so much the more as you see the day approaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we sin wilfully after having the knowledge of the truth, there is now left no sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>But a certain dreadful expectation of judgment, and the rage of a fire which shall consume the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>A man making void the law of Moses, dieth without any mercy under two or three witnesses:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>How much more, do you think he deserveth worse punishments, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath esteemed the blood of the testament unclean, by which he was sanctified, and hath offered an affront to the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>For we know him that hath said: Vengeance belongeth to me, and I will repay. And again: The Lord shall judge his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>But call to mind the former days, wherein, being illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>And on the one hand indeed, by reproaches and tribulations, were made a gazingstock; and on the other, became companions of them that were used in such sort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For you both had compassion on them that were in bands, and took with joy the being stripped of your own goods, knowing that you have a better and a lasting substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Do not therefore lose your confidence, which hath a great reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>For patience is necessary for you; that, doing the will of God, you may receive the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>For yet a little and a very little while, and he that is to come, will come, and will not delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>But my just man liveth by faith; but if he withdraw himself, he shall not please my soul.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Now faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>For by this the ancients obtained a testimony.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.15'>By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise always to God, that is to say, the fruit of lips confessing to his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.16'>And do not forget to do good, and to impart; for by such sacrifices God's favour is obtained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.17'>Obey your prelates, and be subject to them. For they watch as being to render an account of your souls; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief. For this is not expedient for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.18'>Pray for us. For we trust we have a good conscience, being willing to behave ourselves well in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.19'>And I beseech you the more to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.20'>And may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great pastor of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, in the blood of the everlasting testament,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.21'>Fit you in all goodness, that you may do his will; doing in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.22'>And I beseech you, brethren, that you suffer this word of consolation. For I have written to you in a few words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.23'>Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty: with whom (if he come shortly) I will see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.24'>Salute all your prelates, and all the saints. The brethren from Italy salute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.25'>Grace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
