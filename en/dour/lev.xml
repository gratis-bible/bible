      <chapter osisID='Lev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.1'>And the Lord called Moses, and spoke to him from the tabernacle of the testimony, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.2'>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The man among you that shall offer to the Lord a sacrifice of the cattle, that is, offering victims of oxen and sheep,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.3'>If his offering be a holocaust, and of the herd, he shall offer a male without blemish, at the door of the testimony, to make the Lord favourable to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.4'>And he shall put his hand upon the head of the victim, and it shall be acceptable, and help to its expiation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.5'>And he shall immolate the calf before the Lord, and the priests the sons of Aaron shall offer the blood thereof, pouring it round about the altar, which is before the door of the tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.6'>And when they have flayed the victim, they shall cut the joints into pieces,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.7'>And shall put fire on the altar, having before laid in order a pile of wood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.8'>And they shall lay the parts that are cut out in order thereupon, to wit, the head, and all things that cleave to the liver,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.9'>The entrails and feet being washed with water: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for a holocaust, and a sweet savour to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.10'>And if the offering be of the hocks, a holocaust of sheep or of goats, he shall offer a male without blemish:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.11'>And he shall immolate it at the side of the altar that looketh to the north, before the Lord: but the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof upon the altar round about:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.12'>And they shall divide the joints, the head, and all that cleave to the liver: and shall lay them upon the wood, under which the fire is to be put:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.13'>But the entrails and the feet they shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer it all and burn it all upon the altar for a holocaust, and most sweet savour to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.14'>But if the oblation of a holocaust to the Lord be of birds, of turtles, or of young pigeons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.15'>The priest shall offer it at the altar: and twisting back the neck, and breaking the place of the wound, he shall make the blood run down upon the brim of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.16'>But the crop of the throat, and the feathers he shall cast beside the altar at the east side, in the place where the ashes are wont to be poured out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.17'>And he shall break the pinions thereof, and shall not cut, nor divide it with a knife, and shall burn it upon the altar, putting fire under the wood. It is a holocaust and oblation of most sweet savour to the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.1'>When any one shall offer an oblation of sacrifice to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour, and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.2'>And shall bring it to the sons of Aaron the priests: and one of them shall take a handful of the flour and oil, and all the frankincense, and shall put it a memorial upon the altar for a most sweet savour to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.3'>And the remnant of the sacrifice shall be Aaron's, and his sons', holy of holies of the offerings of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.4'>But when thou offerest a sacrifice baked in the oven of flour, to wit, loaves without leaven, tempered with oil, and unleavened wafers, anointed with oil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.5'>If thy oblation be from the fryingpan, of flour tempered with oil, and without leaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.6'>Thou shalt divide it into little pieces, and shalt pour oil upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.7'>And if the sacrifice be from the gridiron, in like manner the flour shall be tempered with oil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.8'>And when thou offerest it to the Lord, thou shalt deliver it to the hands of the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.9'>And when he hath offered it, he shall take a memorial out of the sacrifice, and burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.10'>And whatsoever is left, shall be Aaron's, and his sons', holy of holies of the offerings of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.11'>Every oblation that is offered to the Lord shall be made without leaven, neither shall any leaven or honey be burnt in the sacrifice to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.12'>You shall offer only the firstfruits of them and gifts: but they shall not be put upon the altar, for a savour of sweetness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.13'>Whatsoever sacrifice thou offerest, thou shalt season it with salt, neither shalt thou take away the salt of the covenant of thy God from thy sacrifice. In all thy oblations thou shalt offer salt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.14'>But if thou offer a gift of the firstfruits of thy corn to the Lord, of the ears yet green, thou shalt dry it at the fire, and break it small like meal, and so shalt thou offer thy firstfruits to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.15'>Pouring oil upon it and putting on frankincense, because it is the oblation of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.16'>Whereof the priest shall burn for a memorial of the gift, part of the corn broken small and of the oil, and all the frankincense.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.1'>And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offerings, and he will offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer them without blemish before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.2'>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his victim, which shall be slain in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony, and the sons of Aaron the priests shall pour the blood round about upon the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.3'>And they shall offer of the sacrifice of peace offerings, for an oblation to the Lord, the fat that covereth the entrails, and all the fat that is within.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.4'>The two kidneys with the fat wherewith the flanks are covered, and the caul of the liver with the two little kidneys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.5'>And they shall burn them upon the altar, for a holocaust, putting fire under the wood: for an oblation of most sweet savour to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.6'>But if his oblation and the sacrifice of peace offering be of the flock, whether he offer male or female, they shall be without blemish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.7'>If he offer a lamb before the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.8'>He shall put his hand upon the head of his victim: and it shall be slain in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony: and the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof round about upon the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.9'>And they shall offer of the victim of peace offerings a sacrifice to the Lord: the fat and the whole rump,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.10'>With the kidneys, and the fat that covereth the belly and all the vitals and both the little kidneys, with the fat that is about the flanks, and the caul of the liver with the little kidneys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.11'>And the priest shall burn them upon the altar, for the food of the fire, and of the oblation of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.12'>If his offering be a goat, and he offer it to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.13'>He shall put his hand upon the head thereof: and shall immolate it in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony. And the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof round about upon the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.14'>And they shall take of it for the food of the Lord's fire, the fat that covereth the belly, and that covereth all the vital parts :</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.15'>The two little kidneys with the caul that is upon them which is by the flanks, and the fat of the liver with the little kidneys:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.16'>And the priest shall burn them upon the altar, for the food of the fire, and of a most sweet savour. All the fat shall be the Lord's.</verse>
