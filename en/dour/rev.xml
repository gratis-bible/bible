      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to make known to his servants the things which must shortly come to pass: and signified, sending by his angel to his servant John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>Who hath given testimony to the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, what things soever he hath seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed is he, that readeth and heareth the words of this prophecy; and keepeth those things which are written in it; for the time is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from him that is, and that was, and that is to come, and from the seven spirits which are before his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth, who hath loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>And hath made us a kingdom, and priests to God and his Father, to him be glory and empire for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold, he cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they also that pierced him. And all the tribes of the earth shall bewail themselves because of him. Even so. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, saith the Lord God, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I John, your brother and your partner in tribulation, and in the kingdom, and patience in Christ Jesus, was in the island, which is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in the spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>Saying: What thou seest, write in a book, and send to the seven churches which are in Asia, to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamus, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>And in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the feet, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>And his head and his hairs were white, as white wool, and as snow, and his eyes were as a flame of fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>And his feet like unto fine brass, as in a burning furnace. And his voice as the sound of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>And he had in his right hand seven stars. And from his mouth came out a sharp two edged sword: and his face was as the sun shineth in his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I had seen him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying: Fear not. I am the First and the Last,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>And alive, and was dead, and behold I am living for ever and ever, and have the keys of death and of hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write therefore the things which thou hast seen, and which are, and which must be done hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>The mystery of the seven stars, which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. And the seven candlesticks are the seven churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write: These things saith he, who holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them that are evil, and thou hast tried them, who say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>And thou hast patience, and hast endured for my name, and hast not fainted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>But I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first charity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Be mindful therefore from whence thou art fallen: and do penance, and do the first works. Or else I come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou do penance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaites, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: To him, that overcometh, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>And to the angel of the church of Smyrna write: These things saith the First and the Last, who was dead, and is alive:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I know thy tribulation and thy poverty, but thou art rich: and thou art blasphemed by them that say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold, the devil will cast some of you into prison that you may be tried: and you shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful until death: and I will give thee the crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: He that shall overcome, shall not be hurt by the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>And to the angel of the church of Pergamus write: These things, saith he, that hath the sharp two edged sword:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I know where thou dwellest, where the seat of Satan is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith. Even in those days when Antipas was my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have against thee a few things: because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat, and to commit fornication:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>In like manner do penance: if not, I will come to thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: To him that overcometh, I will give the hidden manna, and will give him a white counter, and in the counter, a new name written, which no man knoweth, but he that receiveth it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>And to the angel of the church of Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like to a flame of fire, and his feet like to fine brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know thy works, and thy faith, and thy charity, and thy ministry, and thy patience, and thy last works which are more than the former.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have against thee a few things: because thou sufferest the woman Jezabel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach, and to seduce my servants, to commit fornication, and to eat of things sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I gave her a time that she might do penance, and she will not repent of her fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Behold, I will cast her into a bed: and they that commit adultery with her shall be in very great tribulation, except they do penance from their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>And I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts, and I will give to every one of you according to your works. But to you I say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>And to the rest who are at Thyatira: Whosoever have not this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I will not put upon you any other burthen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>Yet that, which you have, hold fast till I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>And he that shall overcome, and keep my works unto the end, I will give him power over the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and as the vessel of a potter they shall be broken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>As I also have received of my Father: and I will give him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>And to the angel of the church of Sardis, write: These things saith he, that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast the name of being alive: and thou art dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Be watchful and strengthen the things that remain, which are ready to die. For I find not thy works full before my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Have in mind therefore in what manner thou hast received and heard: and observe, and do penance. If then thou shalt not watch, I will come to thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>But thou hast a few names in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments: and they shall walk with me in white, because they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He that shall overcome, shall thus be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>And to the angel of the church of Philadelphia, write: These things saith the Holy One and the true one, he that hath the key of David; he that openeth, and no man shutteth; shutteth, and no man openeth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>I know thy works. Behold, I have given before thee a door opened, which no man can shut: because thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Behold, I will bring of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie. Behold, I will make them to come and adore before thy feet. And they shall know that I have loved thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I will also keep thee from the hour of the temptation, which shall come upon the whole world to try them that dwell upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>Behold, I come quickly: hold fast that which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>He that shall overcome, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God; and he shall go out no more; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and my new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>And to the angel of the church of Laodicea, write: These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, who is the beginning of the creation of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold, nor hot. I would thou wert cold, or hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>But because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold, not hot, I will begin to vomit thee out of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because thou sayest: I am rich, and made wealthy, and have need of nothing: and knowest not, that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I counsel thee to buy of me gold fire tried, that thou mayest be made rich; and mayest be clothed in white garments, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not appear; and anoint thy eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>Such as I love, I rebuke and chastise. Be zealous therefore, and do penance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Behold, I stand at the gate, and knock. If any man shall hear my voice, and open to me the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>To him that shall overcome, I will give to sit with me in my throne: as I also have overcome, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After these things I looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard, as it were, of a trumpet speaking with me, said: Come up hither, and I will shew thee the things which must be done hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>And immediately I was in the spirit: and behold there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne one sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>And he that sat, was to the sight like the jasper and the sardine stone; and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>And round about the throne were four and twenty seats; and upon the seats, four and twenty ancients sitting, clothed in white garments, and on their heads were crowns of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there were seven lamps burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>And in the sight of the throne was, as it were, a sea of glass like to crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>And the first living creature was like a lion: and the second living creature like a calf: and the third living creature, having the face, as it were, of a man: and the fourth living creature was like an eagle flying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And the four living creatures had each of them six wings; and round about and within they are full of eyes. And they rested not day and night, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And when those living creatures gave glory, and honour, and benediction to him that sitteth on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>The four and twenty ancients fell down before him that sitteth on the throne, and adored him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>Thou art worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory, and honour, and power: because thou hast created all things; and for thy will they were, and have been created.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne, a book written within and without, sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a strong angel, proclaiming with a loud voice: Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no man was able, neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the earth, to open the book, nor to look on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open the book, nor to see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>And one of the ancients said to me: Weep not; behold the lion of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I saw: and behold in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the ancients, a Lamb standing as it were slain, having seven horns and seven eyes: which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when he had opened the book, the four living creatures, and the four and twenty ancients fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they sung a new canticle, saying: Thou art worthy, O Lord, to take the book, and to open the seals thereof; because thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God, in thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>And hast made us to our God a kingdom and priests, and we shall reign on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the living creatures, and the ancients; and the number of them was thousands of thousands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and benediction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And every creature, which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them: I heard all saying: To him that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb, benediction, and honour, and glory, and power, for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four living creatures said: Amen. And the four and twenty ancients fell down on their faces, and adored him that liveth for ever and ever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw that the Lamb had opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures, as it were the voice of thunder, saying: Come, and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I saw: and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow, and there was a crown given him, and he went forth conquering that he might conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature, saying: Come, and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And there went out another horse that was red: and to him that sat thereon, it was given that he should take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another, and a great sword was given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying: Come, and see. And behold a black horse, and he that sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying: Two pounds of wheat for a penny, and thrice two pounds of barley for a penny, and see thou hurt not the wine and the oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature, saying: Come, and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And behold a pale horse, and he that sat upon him, his name was Death, and hell followed him. And power was given to him over the four parts of the earth, to kill with sword, with famine, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And they cried with a loud voice, saying: How long, O Lord (holy and true) dost thou not judge and revenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And white robes were given to every one of them one; and it was said to them, that they should rest for a little time, till their fellow servants, and their brethren, who are to be slain, even as they, should be filled up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I saw, when he had opened the sixth seal, and behold there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair: and the whole moon became as blood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>And the stars from heaven fell upon the earth, as the fig tree casteth its green figs when it is shaken by a great wind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>And the heaven departed as a book folded up: and every mountain, and the islands were moved out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>And the kings of the earth, and the princes, and tribunes, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of mountains:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>And they say to the mountains and the rocks: Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>For the great day of their wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>After these things, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that they should not blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the sign of the living God; and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>Saying: Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we sign the servants of our God in their foreheads.</verse>
