      <chapter osisID='2Chr.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.1'>And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and magnified him to a high degree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.2'>And Solomon gave orders to all Israel, to the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and to the rulers, and to the judges of all Israel, and the heads of the families:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.3'>And he went with all the multitude to the high place of Gabaon, where was the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord, which Moses the servant of God made, in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.4'>For David had brought the ark of God from Cariathiarim to the place, which he had prepared for it, and where he had pitched a tabernacle for it, that is, in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.5'>And the altar of brass, which Beseleel the son of Uri the son of Hur had made, was there before the tabernacle of the Lord: and Solomon and all the assembly sought it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.6'>And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar, before the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up on it a thousand victims.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.7'>And behold that night God appeared to him, saying: Ask what thou wilt that I should give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.8'>And Solomon said to God: Thou hast shewn great kindness to my father David: and hast made me king in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.9'>Now therefore, O Lord God, let thy word be fulfilled, which thou hast promised to David my father: for thou hast made me king over thy great people, which is as innumerable as the dust of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.10'>Give me wisdom and knowledge that I may come in and go out before thy people: for who can worthily judge this thy people, which is so great?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.11'>And God said to Solomon: Because this choice hath pleased thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, and wealth, and glory, nor the lives of them that hate thee, nor many days of life: but hast asked wisdom and knowledge, to be able to judge my people, over which I have made thee king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.12'>Wisdom and knowledge are granted to thee: and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and glory, so that none of the kings before thee, nor after thee, shall be like thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.13'>Then Solomon came from the high place of Gabaon to Jerusalem before the tabernacle of the covenant, and reigned over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.14'>And he gathered to himself chariots and horsemen, and he had a thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he placed them in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.15'>And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees as sycamores, which grow in the plains in great multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.16'>And there were horses brought him from Egypt, and from Coa by the king's merchants, who went, and bought at a price,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.17'>A chariot of four horses for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: in like manner market was made in all the kingdoms of the Hethites, and of the kings of Syria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.1'>And Solomon determined to build a house to the name of the Lord, and a palace for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.2'>And he numbered out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to over- see them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.3'>He sent also to Hiram king of Tyre, saying: As thou didst with David my father, and didst send him cedars, to build him a house, in which he dwelt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.4'>So do with me that I may build a house to the name of the Lord my God, to dedicate it to burn incense before him, and to perfume with aromatical spices, and for the continual setting forth of bread, and for the holocausts, morning and evening, and on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and the solemnities of the Lord our God for ever, which are commanded for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.5'>For the house which I desire to build, is great: for our God is great above all gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.6'>Who then can be able to build him a worthy house? if heaven, and the heavens of heavens cannot contain him: who am I that I should be able to build him a house? but to this end only, that incense may be burnt before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.7'>Send me therefore a skilful man, that knoweth how to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, and in iron, in purple, in scarlet and in blue, and that hath skill in engraving, with the artificers, which I have with me in Judea and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.8'>Send me also cedars, and fir trees, and pine trees from Libanus: for I know that thy servants are skilful in cutting timber in Libanus, and my servants shall be with thy servants,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.9'>To provide me timber in abundance. For the house which I desire to build, is to be exceeding great, and glorious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.10'>And I will give thy servants the workmen that are to cut down the trees, for their food twenty thousand cores of wheat, and as many cores of barley, and twenty thousand measures of wine, and twenty thousand measures of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.11'>And Hiram king of Tyre sent a letter to Solomon, saying: Because the Lord hath loved his people, therefore he hath made thee king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.12'>And he added, saying: Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who hath given to king David a wise and knowing son, endued with understanding and prudence, to build a house to the Lord, and a palace for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.13'>I therefore have sent thee my father Hiram, a wise and most skilful man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.14'>The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, whose father was a Tyrian, who knoweth how to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, and in iron, and in marble, and in timber, in purple also, and violet, and silk and scarlet: and who knoweth to grave all sort of graving, and to devise ingeniously all that there may be need of in the work with thy artificers, and with the artificers of my lord David thy father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.15'>The wheat therefore, and the barley and the oil, and the wine, which thou, my lord, hast promised, send to thy servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.16'>And we will cut down as many trees out of Libanus, as thou shalt want, and will convey them in floats by sea to Joppe: and it will be thy part to bring them thence to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.17'>And Solomon numbered all the proselytes in the land of Israel, after the numbering which David his father had made, and they were found a hundred and fifty-three thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.18'>And he set seventy thousand of them to carry burdens on their shoulders, and eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountains: and three thousand and six hundred to be overseers of the work of the people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.1'>And Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem, in mount Moria, which had been shewn to David his father, in the place which David had prepared in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.2'>And he began to build in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.3'>Now these are the foundations, which Solomon laid, to build the house of God, the length by the first measure sixty cubits, the breadth twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.4'>And the porch in the front, which was extended in length according to the measure of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits: and the height was a hundred and twenty cubits: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.5'>And the greater house he ceiled with deal boards, and overlaid them with plates of fine gold throughout: and he graved in them palm trees, and like little chains interlaced with one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.6'>He paved also the floor of the temple with most precious marble, of great beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.7'>And the gold of the plates with which he overlaid the house, and the beams thereof, and the posts, and the walls, and the doors was of the finest: and he graved cherubims on the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.8'>He made also the house of the holy of holies: the length of it according to the breadth of the temple, twenty cubits, and the breadth of it in like manner twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with plates of gold, amounting to about six hundred talents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.9'>He made also nails of gold, and the weight of every nail was fifty sicles: the upper chambers also he overlaid with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.10'>He made also in the house of the holy of holies two cherubims of image work: and he overlaid them with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.11'>The wings of the cherubims were extended twenty cubits, so that one wing was five cubits long, and reached to the wall of the house: and the other was also five cubits long, and reached to the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.12'>In like manner the wing of the other cherub, was five cubits long, and reached to the wall: and his other wing was five cubits long, and touched the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.13'>So the wings of the two cherubims were spread forth, and were extended twenty cubits: and they stood upright on their feet, and their faces were turned toward the house without.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.14'>He made also a veil of violet, purple, scarlet, and silk: and wrought in it cherubims.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.15'>He made also before the doors of the temple two pillars, which were five and thirty cubits high: and their chapiters were five cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.16'>He made also as it were little chains in the oracle, and he put them on the heads of the pillars: and a hundred pomegranates, which he put between the little chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.17'>These pillars he put at the entrance of the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left: that which was on the right hand, he called Jachin: and that on the left hand, Boot.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.1'>He made also an altar of brass twenty cubits long, and twenty cubits broad, and ten cubits high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.3'>Also a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass: it was five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.4'>And under it there was the likeness of oxen, and certain engravings on the outside of ten cubits compassed the belly of the sea, as it were with two rows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.5'>And the oxen were cast: and the sea itself was set upon the twelve oxen, three of which looked toward the north, and other three toward the west: and other three toward the south, and the other three that remained toward the east, and the sea stood upon them: and the hinder parts of the oxen were in- ward under the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.6'>Now the thickness of it was a handbreadth, and the brim of it was like the brim of a cup, or of a crisped lily: and it held three thousand measures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.7'>He made also ten lavers: and he see five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them all such things as they mere to offer for holocausts: but the sea was for the priests to wash in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.8'>And he made ten golden candlesticks, according to the form which they were commanded to be made by: and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.9'>Moreover also ten tables: and he set them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. Also a hundred bowls of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.10'>He made also the court of the priests, and a great hall, and doors in the hall, which he covered with brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.11'>And he set the sea on the right side over against the east toward the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.12'>And Hiram made caldrons, and fleshhooks, and bowls: and finished all the king's work in the house of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.13'>That is to say, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters, and the network, to cover the chapiters over the pommels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.14'>And four hundred pomegranates, and two wreaths of network, so that two rows of pomegranates were joined to each wreath, to cover the pommels, and the chapiters of the pillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.15'>He made also bases, and lavers, which he set upon the bases:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.16'>One sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.17'>And the caldrons, and fleshhooks, and bowls. All the vessels did Hiram his father make for Solomon in the house of the Lord of the finest brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.18'>In the country near the Jordan did the king cast them, in a clay ground between Sochot and Saredatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.19'>And the multitude of vessels was innumerable, so that the weight of the brass was not known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.20'>And Solomon made all the vessels for the house of God, and the golden altar, and the tables, upon which were the leaves of proposition,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.21'>The candlesticks also of most pure gold with their lamps to give light before the oracle, according to the manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.22'>And certain flowers, and lamps, and golden tongs: all were made of the finest gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.23'>The vessels also for the perfumes, and the censers, and the bowls, and the mortars, of pure gold. And he graved the doors of the inner temple, that is, for the holy of holies: and the doors of the temple without were of gold. And thus all the work was finished which So</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.1'>Then Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had vowed, the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels he put among the treasures of the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.2'>And after this he gathered together the ancients of Israel, and all the princes of the tribes, and the heads of the families, of the children of Israel to Jerusalem, to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Sion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.3'>And all the men of Israel came to the king in the solemn day of the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.4'>And when all the ancients of Israel were come, the Levites took up the ark,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.5'>And brought it in, together with all the furniture of the tabernacle. And the priests with the Levites carried the vessels of the sanctuary, which were in the tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.6'>And king Solomon and all the assembly of Israel, and all that were gathered together before the ark, sacrificed rams, and oxen without number: so great was the multitude of the victims.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.7'>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its place, that is, to the oracle of the temple, into the holy of holies under the wings of the cherubims:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.8'>So that the cherubims spread their wings over the place, in which the ark was set, and covered the ark itself and its staves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.9'>Now the ends of the staves wherewith the ark was carried, because they were some thing longer, were seen before the oracle: but if a man were a little outward, he could not see them. So the ark has been there unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.10'>And there was nothing else in the ark but the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb when the Lord gave the law to the children of Israel, at their coming out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.11'>Now when the priests were come out of the sanctuary, (for all the priests that could be found there, mere sanctified: and as yet at that time the courses and orders of the ministries were not divided among them,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.12'>Both the Levites and the singing men, that is, both they that were under Asaph, and they that were under Heman, and they that were under Idithun, with their sons, and their brethren, clothed with fine linen, sounded with cymbals, and psalteries, and harps, standing on the east side of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests, sounding with trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.13'>So when they all sounded together, both with trumpets, and voice, and cymbals, and organs, and with divers kind of musical instruments, and lifted up their voice on high : the sound was heard afar off, so that when they began to praise the Lord, and to say: Give glory to the Lord for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever: the house of God was filled with a cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.14'>Nor could the priests stand and minister by reason of the cloud. For the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.1'>Then Solomon said: The Lord promised that he would dwell in a cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.2'>But I have built a house to his name, that he might dwell there for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.3'>And the king turned his face, and blessed all the multitude of Israel (for all the multitude stood attentive) and he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.4'>Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who hath accomplished in deed that which he spoke to David my father, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.5'>From the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel, for a house to be built in it to my name: neither chose I any other man, to be the ruler of my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.6'>But I chose Jerusalem, that my name might be there: and I chose David to set him over my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.7'>And whereas David my father had a mind to build a house to the name of the Lord the God of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.8'>The Lord said to him: Forasmuch as it was thy will to build a house to my name, thou hast done well indeed in having such a will:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.9'>But thou shalt not build the house, but thy son, who shall come out of thy loins, he shall build a house to my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.10'>The Lord therefore hath accomplished his word which he spoke: and I am risen up in the place of David my father, and sit upon the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised : and have built a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.11'>And I have put in it the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord, which he made with the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.12'>And he stood before the altar of the I Lord, in presence of all the multitude of Israel, and stretched forth his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.13'>For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, and had set it in the midst of the temple, which was five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high: and he stood upon it: then kneeling down in the presence of all the multitude of Israel, and lifting up his hands towards heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.14'>He said: O Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in heaven nor in earth: who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.15'>Who hast performed to thy servant David my father all that thou hast promised him: and hast accomplished in fact, what thou hast spoken with thy mouth, as also the present time proveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.16'>Now then, O Lord God of Israel, fulfil to thy servant David my father, whatsoever thou hast promised him, saying: There shall not fail thee a man in my sight, to sit upon the throne of Israel: yet so that thy children take heed to their ways, and walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.17'>And now, Lord God of Israel, let thy word be established which thou hast spoken to thy servant David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.18'>Is it credible then that God should dwell with men on the earth? If heaven and the heavens of heavens do not contain thee, how much less this house, which I have built?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.19'>But to this end only it is made, that thou mayest regard the prayer of thy servant and his supplication, O Lord my God: and mayest hear the prayers which thy servant poureth out before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.20'>That thou mayest open thy eyes upon this house day and night, upon the place wherein thou hast promised that thy name should be called upon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.21'>And that thou wouldst hear the prayer which thy servant prayeth in it: hearken then to the prayers of thy servant, and of thy people Israel. Whosoever shall pray in this place, hear thou from thy dwelling place, that is, from heaven, and shew mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.22'>If any man sin against his neighbour, and come to swear against him, and bind himself with a curse before the altar in this house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.23'>Then hear thou from heaven, and do justice to thy servants, so as to requite the wicked by making his wickedness fall upon his own head, and to revenge the just, rewarding him according to his justice.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.2'>And in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Sesac king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem (because they had sinned against the Lord)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.3'>With twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt, to wit, Libyans, and Troglodites, and Ethiopians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.4'>And he took the strongest cities in Juda, and came to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.5'>And Semeias the prophet came to Roboam, and to the princes of Juda, that were gathered together in Jerusalem, fleeing from Sesac, and he said to them : Thus saith the Lord: You have left me, and I have left you in the hand of Sesac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.6'>And the princes of Israel, and the king, being in a consternation, said: The Lord is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.7'>And when the Lord saw that they were humbled, the word of the Lord came to Semeias, saying: Because they are humbled, I will not destroy them, and I will give them a little help, and my wrath shall not fall upon Jerusalem by the hand of Sesac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.8'>But yet they shall serve him, that they may know the difference between my service, and the service of a kingdom of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.9'>So Sesac king of Egypt departed from Jerusalem, taking away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's house, and he took all with him, and the golden shields that Solomon had made,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.10'>Instead of which the king made brazen ones, and delivered them to the captains of the shieldbearers, who guarded the entrance of the palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.11'>And when the king entered into the house of the Lord, the shieldbearers came and took them, and brought them back again to their armoury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.12'>But yet because they were humbled, the wrath of the Lord turned away from them, and they were not utterly destroyed: for even in Juda there were found good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.13'>King Roboam therefore was strengthened in Jerusalem, and reigned: he was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord chose out of all the tribes of Israel, to establish his name there: and the name of his mother was Naama an Ammonitess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.14'>But he did evil, and did not prepare his heart to seek the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.15'>Now the acts of Roboam first and last are written in the books of Semeias the prophet, and of Addo the seer, and diligently recorded: and there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam all their days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.16'>And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. And Abia his son reigned in his stead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.1'>In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, Abia reigned over Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.2'>Three years he reigned in Jerusalem, and his mother's name was Michaia, the daughter of Uriel of Gabaa: and there was war between Abia and Jeroboam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.3'>And when Abia had begun battle, and had with him four hundred thou- sand most valiant and chosen men, Jeroboam put his army in array against him, eight hundred thousand men, who were also chosen and most valiant for war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.4'>And Abia stood upon mount Semeron, which was in Ephraim, and said: Hear me, O Jeroboam, and all Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.5'>Do you not know that the Lord God of Israel gave to David the kingdom over Israel for ever, to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.6'>And Jeroboam the son of Nabat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up: m and rebelled against his lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.7'>And there were gathered to him vain men, and children of Belial: and they prevailed against Roboam the son of Solomon: for Roboam was unexperienced, and of a fearful heart, and could not resist them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.8'>And now you say that you are able to withstand the kingdom of the Lord, which he possesseth by the sons of David, and you have a great multitude of people, and golden calves, which Jeroboam hath made you for gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.9'>And you have cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites: and you have made you priests, like all the nations of the earth: whosoever cometh and consecrateth his hand with a bullock of the herd, and with seven rams, is made a priest of those who are no gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.10'>But the Lord is our God, whom we forsake not, and the priests who minister to the Lord are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites are in their order.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.11'>And they offer holocausts to the Lord, every day, morning and evening, and incense made according to the ordinance of the law, and the leaves are set forth on a most clean table, and there is with us the golden candlestick, and the lamps thereof, to be lighted always in the evening: for we keep the precepts of the Lord our God, whom you have forsaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.12'>Therefore God is the leader in our army, and his priests who sound with trumpets, and resound against you: O children of Israel, fight not against the Lord the God of your fathers, for it is not good for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.13'>While he spoke these things, Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind him. And while he stood facing the enemies, he encompassed Juda. who perceived it not, with his army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.14'>And when Juda looked back, they saw the battle coming upon them both before and behind, and they cried to the Lord: and the priests began to sound with the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.15'>And all the men of Juda shouted: and behold when they shouted, God terrified Jeroboam, and all Israel that stood against Abia and Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.16'>And the children of Israel fled before Juda, and the Lord delivered them into their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.17'>And Abia and his people slew them with a great slaughter, and there fell wounded of Israel five hundred thousand valiant men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.18'>And the children of Israel were brought down, at that time, and the children of Juda were exceedingly strengthened, because they had trusted in the Lord the God of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.19'>And Abia pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel and her daughters, and Jesana with her daughters, Ephron also and her daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.20'>And Jeroboam was not able to resist any more, in the days of Abia: and the Lord struck him, and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.21'>But Abia, being strengthened in his kingdom, took fourteen wives: and begot two and twenty sons, and sixteen daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.22'>And the rest of the acts of Abia, and of his ways and works, are written diligently in the book of Addo the prophet.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.14'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.1'>And Abia slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead: in his days the land was quiet ten years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.2'>And Asa did that which was good and pleasing in the sight of his God, and he destroyed the altars of foreign worship, and the high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.3'>And broke the statues, and cut down the groves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.4'>And he commanded Juda to seek the Lord the God of their fathers, and to do the law, and all the commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.5'>And he took away out of all the cities of Juda the altars, and temples, and reigned in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.6'>He built also strong cities in Juda, for he was quiet, and there had no wars risen in his time, the Lord giving peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.7'>And he said to Juda: Let us build these cities, and compass them with walls, and fortify them with towers, and gates, and bars, while all is quiet from wars, because we have sought the Lord the God of our fathers, and he hath given us peace round about. So they built, and there was no hinderance in building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.8'>And Asa had in his army of men that bore shields and spears of Juda three hundred thousand, and of Benjamin that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand, all these were most valiant men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.9'>And Zara the Ethiopian came out against them with his army of ten hundred thousand men, and with three hundred chariots: and he came as far as Maresa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.10'>And Asa went out to meet him, and set his army in array for battle in the vale of Sephata, which is near Maresa:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.11'>And he called upon the Lord God, and said: O Lord, there is no difference with thee, whether thou help with few, or with many: help us, O Lord our God: for with confidence in thee, and in thy name, we are come against this multitude. O Lord thou art our God, let not man prevail against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.12'>And the Lord terrified the Ethiopians before Asa and Juda: and the Ethiopians fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.13'>And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to Gerara: and the Ethiopians fell even to utter destruction, for the Lord slew them, and his army fought against them, and they were destroyed. And they took abundance of spoils,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.14'>And they took all the cities round about Gerara: for a great fear was come upon all men: and they pillaged the cities, and carried off much booty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.15'>And they destroyed the sheepcotes, and took an infinite number of cattle, and of camels: and returned to Jerusalem.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.15'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.1'>And the spirit of God came upon Azarias the son of Oded,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.2'>And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him: Hear ye me, Asa, and all Juda and Benjamin: The Lord is with you, because you have been with him. If you seek him, you shall find: but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.3'>And many days shall pass in Israel without the true God, and without a priest a teacher, and without the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.4'>And when in their distress they shall return to the Lord the God of Israel, and shall seek him, they shall find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.5'>At that time there shall be no peace to him that goeth out and cometh in, but terrors on every side among all the inhabitants of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.6'>For nation shall fight against nation, and city against city, for the Lord will trouble them with all distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.7'>Do you therefore take courage, and let not your hands he weakened: for there shall be a reward for your work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.8'>And when Asa had heard the words, and the prophecy of Azarias the son of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and took away the idols out of all the land of Juda, and out of Benjamin, and out of the cities of mount Ephraim, which he had taken, and he dedicated the altar of the Lord, which was before the porch of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.9'>And he gathered together all Juda and Benjamin, and the strangers with them of Ephraim, and Manasses, and Simeon: for many were come over to him out of Israel, seeing that the Lord his God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.10'>And when they were come to Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.14'>And they swore to the Lord with a loud voice with joyful shouting, and with sound of trumpet, and sound of comets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.15'>All that mere in Juda with a curse: for with all their heart they swore, and with all their will they sought him, and they found him, and the Lord gave them rest round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.16'>Moreover Maacha the mother of king Asa he deposed from the royal authority, because she had made in a grove an idol of Priapus: and he entirely destroyed it, and breaking it into pieces, burnt it at the torrent Cedron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.17'>But high places were left in Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.18'>And the things which his father had vowed, and he himself had vowed, he brought into the house of the Lord, gold and silver, and vessels of divers uses.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.1'>And in the six and thirtieth year of his kingdom, Baasa the king of Israel came up against Juda, and built a wall about Rama, that no one might safely go out or come in of the kingdom of Asa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.2'>Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's treasures, and sent to Benadad king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.3'>There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father, wherefore I have sent thee silver and gold, that thou mayst break thy league with Baasa king of Israel, and make him depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.4'>And then Benadad heard this, he sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel: and they took Ahion, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the walled cities of Nephtali.</verse>
