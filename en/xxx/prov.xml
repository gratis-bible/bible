      <chapter osisID='Prov.1'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'>The Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'>To know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>to receive instruction in wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>The wise hears and increases learning, and the one of understanding gets wise counsel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>to understand a proverb and an enigma; the words of the wise, and their difficult sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>My son, hear the instruction of your father, and do not forsake the law of your mother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>for they shall be an ornament of grace to your head, and chains around your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they say, Walk with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those who go down into the Pit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>we shall find all sorts of precious stuff, we shall fill our houses with plunder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>cast in your lot among us, let us all have one purse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>My son, do not walk in the way with them! Withhold your foot from their path;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>for their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>And they lie in wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>So are the ways of everyone who gets unjust gain; it takes away the soul of its master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom cries aloud outside; she utters her voice in the square;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>she calls out over the tumult; at the openings of the gates, in the city she utters her words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'>How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity; and those who scorn desire their scorning; and fools hate knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Turn back at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you; I will make my words known to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I have called, and you refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one pays attention,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>but you have ignored all my counsel, and have not desired my reproof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your terror comes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>when your terror comes like a storm; and your devastation arrives like a tempest, when distress and anguish come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then they shall call upon me, and I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>Because they hated knowledge and chose not the fear of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>They did not desire my counsel; they despised all my reproof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the turning away of the simple kills them, and the ease of fools destroys them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>But whoever listens to me shall live in confidence, and shall rest securely from the dread of evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.2'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.1'>My son, if you will receive my words, and treasure up my commandments within you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.2'>so that you incline your ear to wisdom, and extend your heart to understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'>yes, if you cry out for discernment, lifting up your voice for understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>if you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>then you shall understand the fear of Jehovah, and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'>For Jehovah gives wisdom; out of His mouth come knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.7'>He lays up sound wisdom for the upright; a shield to those who walk in integrity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>to guard the paths of judgment; and He keeps watch over the way of His saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then you shall understand righteousness and justice and equity and every good path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.10'>When wisdom enters into your heart, and knowledge is pleasant to your soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'>discretion shall keep watch over you, understanding shall guard you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>to deliver you from the way of evil, from the man who speaks perverse things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>those who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perversities of the wicked,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>whose paths are crooked, who are devious in their tracks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>to deliver you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who flatters with her words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>who forsakes the guide of her youth and has forgotten the covenant of her God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>For her house leads down to death, and her tracks to the spirits of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>No one going in to her returns, nor do they attain unto the ways of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>That you may walk in the ways of the good and keep the ways of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and those who act deceitfully shall be rooted out of it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.3'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.1'>My son, do not forget my law, but let your heart keep my commandments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.2'>for they shall add length of days and long life and peace to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'>Let not mercy and truth forsake you; tie them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'>so you shall find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, and lean not unto your own understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear Jehovah and depart from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'>It shall be healing to your navel and refreshment to your bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'>Honor Jehovah with your substance, and with the firstfruits of all your increase,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.10'>and your barns shall be filled with plenty, and your vats shall be bursting with new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.11'>My son, do not reject the chastening of Jehovah, and do not loathe His correction;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.12'>for whom Jehovah loves He corrects, even as a father corrects the son with whom he is pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.13'>Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gets understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.14'>for its profit is better than the gain from silver, and its increase more than fine gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.15'>She is more precious than rubies, and all the things you can desire are not to be compared with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.16'>Length of days is in her right hand, riches and honor in her left hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'>She is a tree of life to those who lay hold upon her, and happy is everyone who holds fast to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'>Jehovah has founded the earth by wisdom; He has established the heavens by understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'>the depths were broken up by His knowledge, and the clouds drop down the dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.21'>My son, do not let them depart from your eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.22'>and they shall be life to your soul, and grace to your neck;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.23'>then you shall walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.24'>When you lie down, you shall not be in dread; yea, you shall lie down and your sleep shall be sweet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.25'>Do not be afraid of sudden terror, nor of the devastation of the wicked when it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.26'>For Jehovah shall be at your side, and He shall keep your foot from being caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.27'>Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.28'>Do not say to your neighbor, Go and come back again, and tomorrow I will give, when you have it with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.29'>Do not devise evil against your neighbor, since he dwells by you securely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.30'>Do not strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.31'>Do not be envious of the violent man, and choose none of his ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.32'>for the perverse one is an abomination to Jehovah, but His secret counsel is with the upright.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.33'>The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked, but He blesses the abode of the just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.34'>Surely He scorns the scorners, but He gives grace to the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.35'>The wise inherit honor, but the exaltation of fools is shame.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Prov.4'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.1'>Children, hear the instruction of a father, and pay attention to know understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.2'>for I give you good teaching; do not forsake my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.3'>For I was my fathers son, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.4'>And he taught me and said to me, Let your heart cling to my words; keep my commandments and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.5'>Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.6'>Do not forsake her, and she will preserve you; love her, and she will keep you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.7'>The first thing about wisdom is: Get wisdom. And with all your getting, get understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.8'>Exalt her, and she will lift you up; she shall bring you to honor when you embrace her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.9'>She shall bestow a wreath of grace upon your head; she shall give you a crown of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.10'>Oh my son, hear and receive my sayings, and the years of your life shall be many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.11'>I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in straight tracks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.12'>when you go, your steps shall not be constricted, and when you run, you shall not stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.13'>Take fast hold of instruction, do not let her go; keep her, for she is your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.14'>Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not go in the way of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.15'>Avoid it, do not pass by it; turn from it and pass on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.16'>For they do not sleep unless they have done evil, and their sleep is taken away unless they cause someone to fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.17'>For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.18'>But the path of the just is as the brightness of dawn, that keeps getting brighter until it is fully daytime.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.19'>The way of the wicked is as darkness; they do not know at what they stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.20'>My son, pay attention to my sayings; extend your ear to my words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.21'>let them not depart from your eyes; keep them in the center of your heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.22'>for they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.23'>Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.24'>Turn away from you the crooked mouth, and put perverse lips far from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.25'>Let your eyes look straight ahead, and let your eyelids look straight before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.26'>Ponder the path of your feet, then all your ways will be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.27'>Do not turn to the right hand or to the left; remove your foot from evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.5'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.1'>My son, pay attention to my wisdom; extend your ear to my understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.2'>so that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.3'>For the lips of a strange woman drip honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.4'>but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a cleaver;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.5'>her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on Sheol;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.6'>lest you should ponder the path of life, her paths are unstable; you cannot know them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.7'>Therefore hear me now, O children, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.8'>Remove your ways far from her, and do not come near the door of her house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.9'>lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.10'>that strangers not be filled with your strength, nor your labors be in the house of a foreigner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.11'>and you moan in the end, when your flesh and body are spent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.12'>and say, How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised correction;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.13'>and I have not given heed to the voice of my teachers, nor extended my ear to those instructing me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.14'>I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.15'>Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.16'>Should your springs be dispersed abroad, like streams of water in the streets?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.17'>Let them be only your own, and not for strangers with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.18'>Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of your youth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.19'>as a loving deer and a graceful doe, let her breasts satisfy you at all times, and always be intoxicated in her love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.20'>For why, my son, will you be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a foreigner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.21'>For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah, and He ponders all his tracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.22'>His own iniquities shall capture the wicked, and he shall be held with the cords of his sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.23'>He shall die without instruction, and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.1'>My son, if you are surety for your friend, if you have struck your hands with a stranger,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.2'>you are snared with the words of your mouth; you are captured with the words of your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.3'>My son, do this then, and deliver yourself when you come into the hand of your friend: go humble yourself and entreat your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.4'>Do not give sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.12'>A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.13'>winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, pointing with his fingers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.14'>Perversity is in his heart, he devises evil all the time, he spreads strife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.15'>Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly; he shall be broken in an instant without remedy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.16'>These six things Jehovah hates; yea, seven are an abomination to his soul:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.17'>Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.18'>a heart that devises evil plans, feet hurrying to run to evil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.19'>a false witness who breathes lies, and he who spreads strife among brothers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.21'>Bind them perpetually to your heart; tie them around your neck.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.25'>Do not lust after her beauty in your heart, and do not let her captivate you with her eyelids.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.26'>For on account of a promiscuous woman, a man comes to a loaf of bread; for the mans wife hunts for the precious soul.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.31.2'>What, my son? And what, the son of my womb? And what, the son of my vows?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.3'>Do not give your strength to women, nor your ways to that which destroys kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.4'>It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, nor for princes strong drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.5'>lest they drink, and forget the Law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.6'>Give strong drink to him who is about to die, and wine to one who is of a heavy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.7'>Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.8'>Open your mouth for the mute, for the judgment of all those sentenced to destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.9'>Open your mouth, judge righteously, and plead the case of the poor and needy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.10'>Who can find a woman of strength? For her value is far above rubies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.11'>The heart of her husband trusts safely in her, so that he shall have no lack of gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.12'>She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.13'>She seeks wool and flax, and works willingly with her hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.14'>She is like the merchant ships; she brings her food from afar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.15'>She also rises while it is still night, and prepares food for her household, and portions for her maidservants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.16'>She considers a field and buys it; from the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.17'>She girds her loins with strength, and makes her arms strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.18'>She tastes that her merchandise is good; her lamp does not go out by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.19'>She reaches her hands to the distaff, and her hand holds the spindle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.20'>She extends her hand to the poor; yea, she reaches out her hands to the needy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.21'>She is not afraid of the snow for her household, for all her household are clothed with scarlet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.22'>She makes tapestry for herself; her clothing is fine linen and purple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.23'>Her husband is known in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.24'>She makes fine linen and sells it, and delivers clothing to the merchants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.25'>Strength and honor are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.26'>She opens her mouth with wisdom, and on her tongue is the law of kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.27'>She watches over the ways of her household, and does not eat the bread of idleness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.28'>Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.29'>Many daughters have dealt with strength, but you have excelled them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.30'>Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears Jehovah, she shall be praised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.31.31'>Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.</verse>
