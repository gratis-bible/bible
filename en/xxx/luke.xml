  <div osisID='Luke' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Inasmuch as many have taken in hand to set in order a narrative of those things which have been fulfilled among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word, delivered them to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it seemed good to me also, having closely followed all things from the very first, to write it to you in orderly fashion, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>that you may know the certainty of the words which you were told.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah. His wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>So it was, that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priesthood, his lot fell to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And the whole multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mothers womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>He will also go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said to the angel, By what shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answered and said to him, I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and was sent to speak to you and bring you these glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>But behold, you will be mute and not able to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people waited for Zacharias, and wondered that he lingered so long in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they recognized that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he made signs to them and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And so it was, as soon as the days of his service were fulfilled, that he departed to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>Now after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>Thus the Lord has done with me, in the days when He looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgins name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And having come in, the angel said to her, Hail, favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>But when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and contemplated what kind of greeting this might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name JESUS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to Him the throne of His father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Then Mary said to the angel, How can this be, since I do not know a man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>Now behold, Elizabeth your kinswoman has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For not one declaration of God will be impossible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>Then Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord. Let it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>And Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it happened, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>And she spoke out with a loud voice and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And why is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For indeed, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>Blessed is she who believes, for there will be a fulfillment of those things which were told her from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said: My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>For He regards the lowly state of His handmaid; for behold, henceforth all generations will count me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For He who is mighty does great things to me, and holy is His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And His mercy is on those who fear Him from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He performs mightily with His arm; He scatters the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He puts down the mighty from their thrones, and exalts the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He fills the hungry with good things, and the rich He sends away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now Elizabeths time was fulfilled for her to be delivered, and she brought forth a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbors and relatives heard how the Lord had magnified His mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>So it was, on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they were calling him by the name of his father, Zacharias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>But they said to her, There is no one among your kindred who is called by this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>So they made signs to his father; what he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. So they all marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came on all who dwelt around them; and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all those who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What kind of child will this be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>and raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets since the world began,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>Deliverance from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>to perform mercy with our fathers and to remember His holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>the oath which He swore to our father Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>To grant us that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>through the tender mercy of our God, with which the Dayspring from on high has visited us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>to give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>So the child grew and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his proclamation to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This census first took place while Cyrenius was governing Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>So it was, that while they were there, the days were fulfilled for her to give birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she gave birth to her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the angel said to them, Do not fear, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this is the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill among men!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And so it came about, when the angels had departed from them into Heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, Let us go at once to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the Babe lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>Now when they had seen, they made widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all those who heard it marveled at the things which were told them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And when eight days were completed for the circumcision of the Child, His name was called JESUS, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the days of her purification according to the Law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves or two young doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was just and devout, waiting for the Consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lords Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>So he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for Him according to the custom of the Law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>Lord, now You are letting Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>for my eyes have seen Your Salvation</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>a Light to bring revelation to the Gentiles, and the Glory of Your people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And Joseph and His mother marveled at the things which were spoken concerning Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother, Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was one, Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and she was a widow of about eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And coming in that instant she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke concerning Him to all those in Jerusalem who looked for redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>So when they had performed all things according to the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>And when they had finished the days, as they returned, the boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>but supposing Him to have been in the company, they went a days journey, and sought Him among their relatives and acquaintances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>So when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And so it was that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, Son, why have You done this to us? Behold, Your father and I have sought You, greatly distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And He said to them, Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I need to be in the things of My Father?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them; but His mother kept all these words in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>while Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, the Word of God came upon John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching an immersion of repentance for the remission of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying: The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill made low; the crooked places shall be made straight and the rough ways level;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be immersed by him, Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>So the multitudes asked him, saying, What shall we do then?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>He answered and said to them, He who has two tunics, let him give to him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>Then tax collectors also came to be immersed, and said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>And he said to them, Collect no more than what is appointed for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>Likewise the soldiers asked him, saying, And what shall we do? So he said to them, Do not intimidate anyone or accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>Now as the people were in expectation, and all reasoned in their hearts about John, whether or not he was the Christ,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.1'>Then Jesus, being filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.2'>being tried for forty days by the devil. And in those days He ate nothing, and afterward, when they had ended, He was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.3'>And the devil said to Him, If You are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.4'>But Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.5'>Then the devil, taking Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.6'>And the devil said to Him, All this authority I will give You, and their glory; for this has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.7'>Therefore, if You will do homage before me, all will be Yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.8'>And Jesus answered and said to him, Get behind Me, Satan! For it is written, You shall do homage to the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.9'>Then he brought Him to Jerusalem, set Him on the wing of the temple, and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.10'>For it is written: He shall give His angels charge concerning you, to guard you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.11'>and, In their hands they shall bear you up, that you may not dash your foot against a stone.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.15'>And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.16'>So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.17'>And He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when He had opened the book, He found the place where it was written:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.18'>The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free with deliverance those who are oppressed;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.20'>And He closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.21'>And He began to say to them, Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.22'>And all bore witness to Him, and marveled at the gracious words going forth out of His mouth. And they said, Is this not Josephs son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.23'>And He said to them, You will surely say this proverb to Me, Physician, heal yourself. Whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in Your country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.24'>And He said, Truly, I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.25'>But I tell you truly, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine throughout all the land;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.28'>And all those in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with rage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.29'>and rose up and thrust Him out of the city; and they led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, in order to throw Him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.30'>But passing through the midst of them, He went His way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>And He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.32'>And they were astonished at His teaching, for His word was with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>And in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.34'>saying, Leave us alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are; the Holy One of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet, and come out of him! And when the demon had thrown him into their midst, it came out of him and did not hurt him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>And they were all amazed and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word this is. For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.37'>And the report about Him went out into every place in the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>And He arose from the synagogue and entered Simons house. And Simons wifes mother was sick with a high fever, and they entreated Him concerning her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>So He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she arose and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>When the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on every one of them and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>And demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, You are the Christ, the Son of God! And He, rebuking them, did not allow them to speak, for they knew that He was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>And when it was day, He departed and went into a deserted place. And the crowd sought Him and came to Him, and tried to keep Him from leaving them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>but He said to them, I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because for this purpose I have been sent.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>And it came to pass that, as the multitude pressed about Him to hear the Word of God, that He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>and saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone from them and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>And He got into one of the boats, which was Simons, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>But Simon answered and said to Him, Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>And when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>and so also were Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Do not fear. From now on you will be catching men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>So when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>And it happened when He was in a certain city, that behold, a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus, fell on his face and begged Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You are able to cleanse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>Then He put out His hand and touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed. Immediately the leprosy left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>And He charged him to tell no one, But go and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing, just as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>However, the report went around concerning Him all the more; and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by Him of their infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>And He withdrew Himself into the wilderness and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>And it happened on a certain day, as He was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present to heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, whom they sought to bring in and lay before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>And when they could not find how they might bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the housetop and let him down with his bed through the tiling into the midst before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>And seeing their faith, He said to him, Man, your sins are forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins but God alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>But knowing their thoughts, answering, Jesus said to them, Why are you reasoning in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier; to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Rise up and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins; He said to the man who was paralyzed, I say to you, Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>Immediately he rose up before them, took up what he had been lying on, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen incredible things today!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>And after these things He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, Follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>So he left all, rose up, and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>Then Levi made Him a great feast in his own house. And there were a great number of tax collectors and others who sat down with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>And their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against His disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>And Jesus answered and said to them, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>Then they said to Him, Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>And He said to them, Can you make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>And He spoke a parable to them: No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old one; otherwise the new makes a tear, and also the piece that was taken out of the new does not match the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>But new wine must be put into new wineskins, and both are preserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>And no one, having drunk old wine, immediately desires new; for he says, The old is better.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.6'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.1'>Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first that He went through the grainfields. And His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate them, rubbing them in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>And some of the Pharisees said to them, Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>But Jesus answering them said, Have you never read this, what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.4'>how he went into the house of God, took and ate the Bread of Presentation, and also gave some to those with him, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.5'>And He said to them, The Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.6'>And it also happened on another Sabbath, that He entered the synagogue and taught. And a man was there whose right hand was withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.7'>So the scribes and Pharisees watched Him closely, whether He would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.8'>But He knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, Arise and stand in the middle. And he arose and stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>Then Jesus said to them, I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>And when He had looked around at them all, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he did so, and his hand was restored as whole as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.11'>But they were filled with madness, and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.12'>Now it came to pass in those days that He went out into the mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.13'>And when it was day, He called His disciples; and from them He chose twelve whom He also named apostles:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.15'>Matthew and Thomas; Jacob the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.16'>Judas of Jacob, and Judas Iscariot who also became a traitor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.17'>And He came down with them and stood on a level place with a crowd of His disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear Him and be healed from their diseases,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.18'>as well as those who were tormented by unclean spirits. And they were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.19'>And the whole multitude sought to touch Him, for power went out from Him and healed everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.20'>And He lifted up His eyes toward His disciples, and said: Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.21'>Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>And a certain centurions servant, who was dear to him, having an illness, was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>So when he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, requesting Him to come and heal his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And when they came to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying that the one for whom He should do this was worthy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>for he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well; the one who had been sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>And it happened the next day, that He went into a city called Nain; and many of His disciples went with Him, as well as a large crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>And when He came near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>And when the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, Do not weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>And He came and touched the coffin, and those who carried him stood still. And He said, Young man, I say to you, Arise!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>And he who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He presented him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>And fear came upon all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has risen up among us; and, God has visited His people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this report about Him went throughout all Judea and all the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>And the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>And John, calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to Jesus, saying, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>When the men had come to Him, they said, John the Immerser has sent us to You, saying, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>And in the same hour He cured many of diseases, plagues, and evil spirits; and to many who were blind He gave sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>Jesus answered and said to them, Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard: that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And blessed is he who is not made to stumble because of Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>And when the messengers of John had departed, He began to speak to the multitudes concerning John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold, those who are splendidly clothed and live in luxury are in kings courts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>This is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>For I say to you, Among those born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Immerser. But he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>And when all the people heard Him, even the tax collectors justified God, having been immersed with the immersion of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been immersed by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>And the Lord said, To what then shall I liken the men of this generation, and what are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, saying: We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we mourned to you, and you did not weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>For John the Immerser came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a glutton and a wino, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>But wisdom is justified from all her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He went to the Pharisees house, and sat down to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the Pharisees house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>and stood at His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>And Jesus answered and said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. So he said, Teacher, speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>Simon answered and said, I suppose the one whom he forgave more. And He said to him, You have rightly judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them away with the hair of her head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>You gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>Then He said to her, Your sins are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>And those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>Then He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>And it came to pass, afterward, that He went through every city and village, preaching and bringing the gospel of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities; Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had come seven demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herods steward, and Susanna, and many others who ministered to Him out of their possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And when a great multitude had gathered, and they had come to Him from every city, He spoke through a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>Some fell on rock; and as soon as it sprang up, it withered away because it lacked moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>But others fell on good ground, sprang up, and produced fruit a hundredfold. When He had said these things He cried out, He who has ears to hear, let him hear!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And His disciples asked Him, saying, What might this parable be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And He said, To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables, that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now the parable is this: The seed is the Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the Word out of their hearts, that they should not believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the Word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of trial draw back away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>And the ones that fell among thorns are those who, when they have heard, go out and are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But the ones that fell on the good ground are those who, having heard the Word with an honest and good heart, keep it and bear fruit with steadfastness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but sets it on a lampstand, that those who enter may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For nothing is concealed that will not be made manifest, nor anything hidden that will not be perceived and come into plain view.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>Therefore take heed how you hear. For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he seems to have will be taken from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>Then His mother and brothers came to Him, and were not able to come up to Him through the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>And it was told to Him, saying, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But He answered and said to them, My mother and My brothers are these who hear the Word of God and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>Now it happened, on a certain day, that He got into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, Let us cross over to the other side of the lake. And they launched out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>But as they sailed He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in peril.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing! Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>And He said to them, Where is your faith? And they were afraid, and marveled, saying to one another, Who can this be? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>And they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>And when He stepped out onto the land, there met Him a certain man from the city who had demons for a long time. And he wore no clothes, nor did he live in a house but among the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before Him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had often seized him, and he was kept under guard, bound with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demons into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion, because many demons had entered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they begged Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Now a herd of many swine was feeding there on the mountain. So they begged Him that He would permit them to enter them. And He permitted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>Then the demons went out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake and drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>Then they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>They also who had seen it told them by what means he who had been demon-possessed was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>Then the whole multitude of the surrounding region of the Gadarenes asked Him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. And He got into the boat and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>Now the man from whom the demons had departed begged Him that he might be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>Return to your own house, and tell what great things God has done for you. And he went his way and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>So it was, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. And he fell down at Jesus feet and begged Him to come to his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as He went, the crowds pressed in on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>And a woman, having a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her livelihood on physicians and could not be healed by any,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>came from behind and touched the border of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jesus said, Who touched Me? When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, Master, the crowds are pressing and crowding You, and You say, Who touched Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>But Jesus said, Somebody touched Me, for I know that power has gone forth out from Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>And He said to her, Daughter, be of good courage; your faith has made you well. Go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While He was still speaking, someone came from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, saying to him, Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the Teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>But when Jesus heard it, He answered him, saying, Do not fear; only believe, and she will be made well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>And when He came into the house, He permitted no one to go in except Peter, Jacob, and John, and the father and mother of the girl.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>Now all wept and bewailed her; but He said, Do not weep; she has not died, but is sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>And they ridiculed Him, knowing that she had died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But He put them all outside, took her by the hand and called, saying, Little girl, arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And He commanded that she be given something to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>And her parents were astonished, but He charged them to tell no one what had happened.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>Then He called His twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>And He sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>And He said to them, Take nothing for the journey, neither staffs nor bag nor bread nor money; and do not have two tunics apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.4'>Whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet as a testimony against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>So they departed and went through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was being done by Him; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old time prophets had risen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>And Herod said, John I have beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things? So he sought to see Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>And the apostles, when they had returned, told Him all that they had done. Then He took them and went aside privately into a deserted place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But when the multitudes knew it, they followed Him; and He received them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>And when the day began to wear away, the twelve came and said to Him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding towns and country, and lodge and get provisions; for we are in a deserted place here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>But He said to them, You give them something to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>For there were about five thousand men. But He said to His disciples, Make them sit down in groups of fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>And they did so, and made them all sit down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>So they all ate and were filled, and twelve baskets of the leftover fragments were taken up by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>And it happened, as He was alone praying, that His disciples were with Him, and He asked them, saying, Who do the crowds say that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>So they answered and said, John the Immerser, but some say Elijah; and others say that one of the old time prophets has risen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered and said, The Christ of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>And He strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>saying, The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>Then He said to them all, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of Me will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.25'>For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and is himself destroyed or suffers loss?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His glory, and that of His Father, and of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>And it came to pass, about eight days after these words, that He took Peter and John and Jacob and went up into the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>And as He prayed, the appearance of His face was altered, and His robe was blindingly white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And behold, two men talked with Him, who were Moses and Elijah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>who appeared in glory and spoke of His departure which He was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>And it happened, as they were parting from Him, that Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah; not knowing what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son. Hear Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>And after the voice came, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>And it happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>And behold, a man from the multitude cried out, saying, Teacher, I beg You, look upon my son, for he is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>And behold, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it throws him into convulsions with foaming, bruises him, and hardly ever departs from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>So I begged Your disciples to cast it out, but they were not able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>Then Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>And as he was still coming, the demon tore him and convulsed him. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the child, and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But while everyone marveled at all the things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>Let these words sink down into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them so that they might not perceive it; and they feared to ask Him about this saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>Then there began a reasoning among them as to which of them might be greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a little child and set him beside Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>and said to them, Whoever receives this little child in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me. For he who is least among you all will be great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>And John answered and said, Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>But Jesus said to him, Do not forbid him, for whoever is not against us is for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>And it came to pass, when the time had come for Him to be lifted up, that He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>and sent messengers before His face. And as they went, they entered a village of the Samaritans, to prepare for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>But they did not receive Him, because His face was set for the journey to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>And when His disciples Jacob and John saw this, they said, Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from Heaven and consume them, just as Elijah did?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But He turned and rebuked them, and said, You do not know what sort of spirit you are of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>For the Son of Man did not come to destroy mens lives but to save them. And they went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>And it happened as they journeyed on the road, that someone said to Him, Lord, I will follow You wherever You go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>And He said to another, Follow Me. But he said, Lord, let me first go and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead, but you go and preach the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>And another also said, Lord, I will follow You, but let me first go and bid farewell to those who are at my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>But Jesus said to him, No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.1'>After these things the Lord appointed seventy others also, and sent them two by two before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.2'>And He said to them, The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few; therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.3'>Go your way; behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.4'>Carry neither money bag, knapsack, nor sandals; and greet no one along the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.5'>And whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.6'>And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on it; if not, it will return to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.7'>And remain in the same house, eating and drinking such things as they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not go from house to house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.8'>Whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.9'>And heal the sick there, and say to them, The kingdom of God has come near to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.10'>But whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.11'>The very dust of your city which clings to us we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.12'>But I say to you that it will be more tolerable in that Day for Sodom than for that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.13'>Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.14'>But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.15'>And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to the heavens, will be thrust down to Hades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.16'>He who hears you hears Me, he who rejects you rejects Me, and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.17'>Then the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.18'>And He said to them, I saw Satan fall like lightning from Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.19'>Behold, I give you authority to tread over serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.20'>Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.21'>In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said, I praise You, Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to babes. Even so, Father, for so it was pleasing in Your sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.22'>All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.24'>for I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and have not seen it, and to hear what you hear, and have not heard it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.26'>He said to him, What is written in the Law? How do you read it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.27'>So he answered and said, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.30'>Then Jesus answered and said: A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, who stripped him of his clothing, wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.31'>Now by chance a certain priest came down that road. And when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.32'>And likewise a Levite, when he arrived at the place, came and looked, and passed by on the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.33'>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was. And when he saw him, he had compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.34'>So he went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and he set him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.35'>And on the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I come back, I will repay you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.36'>So which of these three do you suppose was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.37'>And he said, He who showed mercy on him. Then Jesus said to him, Go and you do likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.38'>Now it happened as they went that He entered a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha received Him into her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.39'>And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus feet and heard His Word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.40'>But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came to Him and said, Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.41'>And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.42'>But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.11'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.1'>Now it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place, when He ceased, that one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.2'>So He said to them, When you pray, say: Our Father in Heaven, Holy is Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.3'>Give us day by day our bread sufficient for the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.4'>And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.5'>And He said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.6'>for a friend of mine has come to me on his journey, and I have nothing to set before him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.7'>and he will answer from within and say, Do not trouble me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.8'>I say to you, Though he will not rise and give to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will rise and give him as much as he needs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.9'>So I say to you, Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.10'>For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.11'>If a son asks for bread from any father among you, he will not give him a stone, will he? Or if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a serpent instead of a fish, will he?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.13'>If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.14'>And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. So it was, when the demon had gone out, that the mute spoke; and the multitudes marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.15'>But some of them said, He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.16'>Others, testing Him, sought from Him a sign from Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.17'>But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.18'>If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? Because you say I cast out demons by Beelzebub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.19'>And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.20'>But if I cast out demons with the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.24'>When an unclean spirit goes out from a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he says, I will return to my house from which I came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.25'>And when he comes, he finds it swept and put in order.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.26'>Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.27'>And it happened, as He spoke these things, that a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, Blessed is the womb that bore You, and the breasts which You sucked!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.28'>But He said, No; rather, blessed are those who hear the Word of God and keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.29'>And while the crowds were thickly gathered together, He began to say, This is an evil generation. It seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.30'>For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.31'>The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.33'>No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a secret place or under a basket, but on a lampstand, that those who come in may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.34'>The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore, when your eye is sound, your whole body also is full of light. But when your eye is evil, your body also is full of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.35'>Therefore take heed that the light which is in you is not darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.36'>If then your whole body is full of light, having no dark part, all will be full of light, as when the shining of a lamp gives you light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.37'>And as He spoke, a certain Pharisee asked Him to dine with him. So He went in and sat down to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.38'>And when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that He had not first washed before dinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.39'>And the Lord said to him, Now you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and dish clean, but your inward part is full of robbery and wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.40'>Foolish ones! Did not He who made the outside make the inside also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.41'>But rather give alms from what is within; and behold, all things are clean to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.42'>But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and all kinds of herbs, and pass by justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without neglecting those.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.43'>Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.44'>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like graves which are not seen, and the men who walk over them are not aware of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.45'>Then one of the lawyers answered and said to Him, Teacher, by saying these things You also insult us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.46'>And He said, Woe to you also, lawyers! For you load men with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.47'>Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.48'>Therefore, you bear witness that you approve of the deeds of your fathers; for they indeed killed them, and you build their tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.49'>Therefore also the wisdom of God said, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.50'>that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required from this generation,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.52'>Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.53'>And as He said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to quarrel with Him forcefully, and to cross-examine Him about many things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.54'>lying in wait for Him, and seeking to catch Him in something He might say, in order to accuse Him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.24'>Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap, which have neither storehouse nor barn; and God feeds them. By how much do you surpass birds.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.44'>Truly, I say to you that he will set him over all that he has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.45'>But if that servant says in his heart, My master is delaying his coming, and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and be drunk,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.46'>the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not expecting him, and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him apart and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.47'>And that servant who knew his masters will, and did not prepare himself or do according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.48'>But he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required; and to whom much has been committed, of him they will ask the more.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.51'>Do you suppose that I came to give peace on earth? I tell you, not at all, but rather division.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.54'>Then He also said to the multitudes, Whenever you see a cloud rising out of the west, immediately you say, A thunder storm is coming; and so it happens.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.14.5'>And He answered them, saying, Which of you, having a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a pit, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.6'>And they were not able to contradict Him regarding these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.7'>So He told a parable to those who were invited, when He noted how they chose the best places, saying to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.8'>When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in the best place, lest one more honorable than you be invited by him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.9'>and he who invited you and him come and say to you, Give place to this man, and then you begin with shame to take the lowest place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.10'>But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes he may say to you, Friend, go up higher. Then you will have glory in the presence of those who sit at the table with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.11'>For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.12'>Then He also said to him who invited Him, When you give a dinner or a supper, do not invite your friends, your brothers, your relatives, nor rich neighbors, lest they also invite you back, and you be repaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.13'>But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.14'>And you will be blessed, because they do not have the means to repay you; for you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.15'>Now when one of those who sat at the table with Him heard these things, he said to Him, Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.16'>Then He said to him, A certain man gave a great supper and invited many,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.17'>and sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were invited, Come, for all things are now ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.18'>But they all with one accord began to decline. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must go and see it. I ask you to have me excused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.19'>And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them. I ask you to have me excused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.20'>And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.21'>So that servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and the maimed and the lame and the blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.22'>And the servant said, Master, it is done as you commanded, and still there is room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.23'>Then the master said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.24'>For I say to you that none of those men who had been invited shall taste of my supper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.25'>And great multitudes went with Him. And He turned and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.26'>If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, and wife and children, and brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.27'>And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.28'>For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to finish it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.29'>lest, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.30'>saying, This man began to build and was not able to finish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.31'>Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.32'>Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks terms of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.33'>So likewise, whoever of you does not bid farewell to all that he has is not able to be My disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.34'>Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its flavor, how shall it be seasoned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.35'>It is neither fit for the land nor for the dunghill, but men throw it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.15.1'>Then all the tax collectors and the sinners came near to Him to hear Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.2'>And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This Man receives sinners and eats with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.3'>So He spoke this parable to them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.4'>What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.5'>And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.6'>And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.7'>I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in Heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.8'>Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.9'>And when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I lost!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.10'>Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.11'>Then He said: A certain man had two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.12'>And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of the estate that falls to me. So he divided to them his livelihood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.13'>And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.14'>But when he had spent all, there arose a severe famine in that land, and he began to be destitute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.15'>And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.16'>And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the husks that the swine ate, and no one gave to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.17'>But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my fathers hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.18'>I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.19'>and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.20'>And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.21'>And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.22'>But the father said to his servants, Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.23'>And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.24'>for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.25'>Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.26'>So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.27'>And he said to him, Your brother has come, and because he has received him safe and sound, your father has killed the fatted calf.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.15.29'>So he answered and said to his father, Lo, these many years I have been serving you; I never transgressed your commandment at any time; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.30'>But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots, you killed the fatted calf for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.31'>And he said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.32'>It was right that we should make merry and rejoice, for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.16'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.1'>He also said to His disciples: There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and an accusation was brought to him that this man was wasting his goods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.2'>So he called him and said to him, What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.3'>Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? For my master is taking the stewardship away from me. I am not able to dig; I am ashamed to beg.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.4'>I know what to do, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.5'>So he called every one of his masters debtors to him, and said to the first, How much do you owe my master?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.6'>And he said, A hundred measures of oil. So he said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.7'>Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? So he said, A hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him, Take your bill, and write eighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.8'>So the master commended the unjust steward because he had acted prudently. For the sons of this world are more prudent in their generation than the sons of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.9'>And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon, that when it fails, they may receive you into eternal dwellings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.10'>He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.11'>Therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.12'>And if you have not been faithful in what is another mans, who will give you what is your own?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.13'>No servant is able to serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. It is not possible to serve God and mammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.14'>Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they derided Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.15'>And He said to them, You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.16'>The Law and the Prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is pressing into it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.16.18'>Whoever puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is put away from her husband commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.19'>There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.20'>And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, full of sores, who was laid at his gate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.21'>desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich mans table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.22'>So it happened that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abrahams bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.23'>And being in torments in Hades, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.24'>Then he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.25'>But Abraham said, Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted and you are tormented.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.26'>And besides all this, between us and you there is a great chasm fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, nor can those from there pass to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.27'>Then he said, I beg you therefore, father, that you would send him to my fathers house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.28'>for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, that they not also come to this place of torment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.29'>Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.30'>And he said, No, father Abraham; but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.31'>But he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one should rise from the dead.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.17'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.1'>Then He said to the disciples, It is impossible but that stumbling blocks will come, but woe to him through whom they do come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.2'>It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.3'>Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.4'>And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day returns to you, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.5'>And the apostles said to the Lord, Give us more faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.6'>So the Lord said, If you have faith as a mustard seed, you might say to this sycamine tree, Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea, and it would obey you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.7'>But which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come, sit down to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.8'>But will he not rather say to him, Prepare something for my supper, and gird yourself and serve me till I have eaten and drunk, and afterward you will eat and drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.9'>Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.10'>So likewise you, when you have done all those things which you are commanded, say, We are unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.11'>Now it happened as He went to Jerusalem that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.12'>And as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood afar off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.13'>And they lifted up their voices and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.14'>So when He saw them, He said to them, Go, show yourselves to the priests. And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.15'>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.16'>and fell down on his face at His feet, giving Him thanks. And he was a Samaritan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.17'>So Jesus answered and said, Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.18'>Were there not any found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.19'>And He said to him, Arise, go your way. Your faith has made you well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.20'>And when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.21'>nor will they say, See here; or, See there; for behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.22'>And He said to the disciples, The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.23'>And they will say to you, Look here; or, Look there. Do not go away nor follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.24'>For as the lightning that flashes out of one part under the heavens, shines to the other part under the heavens, so also the Son of Man will be in His day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.25'>But first He must suffer many things and be rejected from this generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.26'>And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.27'>They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.28'>Likewise as it was also in the days of Lot: They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.29'>but on the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.30'>Even in the same way will it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.31'>In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods are in the house, let him not come down to take them away. And likewise the one who is in the field, let him not return back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.32'>Remember Lots wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.33'>Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.34'>I tell you, in that night there will be two in one bed: the one will be taken and the other will be left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.35'>Two will be grinding together: the one will be taken and the other left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.36'>Two will be in the field: the one will be taken and the other left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.37'>And they answered and said to Him, Where, Lord? And He said to them, Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.18'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.1'>Then He spoke a parable to them, that men always ought to pray and not faint,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.2'>saying: There was in a certain city a judge who did not fear God nor regard man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.3'>And there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, Avenge me from my adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.4'>And he would not for a while; but afterward he said within himself, Though I do not fear God nor regard man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.5'>yet because this widow troubles me I will avenge her, that she not weary me by her continual coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.6'>Then the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.7'>And shall God not avenge His elect who cry out day and night to Him, as He is patient with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.8'>I tell you that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'>Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus to himself, God, I thank You that I am not like other men; extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise his eyes to Heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me a sinner!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.15'>Then they also brought infants to Him that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.16'>But Jesus called them to Him and said, Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.17'>Truly, I say to you, Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.18'>Now a certain ruler asked Him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.19'>So Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One: God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.20'>You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and your mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.21'>And he said, All these things I have kept from my youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.22'>So when Jesus heard these things, He said to him, You still lack one thing. Sell everything that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven; and come, follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.23'>But when he heard this, he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.24'>And when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, He said, How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.25'>For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.26'>And those who heard it said, Who then is able to be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.27'>And He said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.28'>Then Peter said, See, we have left all and followed You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.29'>So He said to them, Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, on account of the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.30'>who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and in the age to come eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.31'>Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.32'>For He will be delivered up to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.33'>They will scourge Him and kill Him. And the third day He will rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.34'>But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know the things which were spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.35'>Then it happened, as He was coming near Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the road begging.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.36'>And hearing a multitude passing by, he asked what it might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.37'>So they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.38'>And he cried out, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.39'>And those who went before rebuked him that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, Son of David, have mercy on me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.40'>So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he had come near, He asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.41'>saying, What do you want Me to do for you? He said, Lord, that I may recover my sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.42'>Then Jesus said to him, Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.43'>And immediately he recovered his sight, and followed Him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.19'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.1'>And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.2'>Now behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.3'>And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.4'>So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.6'>So he made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.7'>But when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.8'>And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, I give half of my possessions to the poor; and whatever I have taken from anyone by false accusation, I restore fourfold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.9'>And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.10'>for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>Now as they heard these things, He spoke another parable, because He was near Jerusalem and because they thought the kingdom of God would appear immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>Therefore He said: A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>So he called ten of his servants, delivered to them ten minas, and said to them, Do business till I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.14'>But his citizens hated him, and sent a delegation after him, saying, We do not desire to have this man reign over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.15'>And so it was that when he returned, having received the kingdom, he then commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.16'>Then came the first, saying, Master, your mina has earned ten minas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>And he said to him, Well done, good servant; because you were faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.18'>And the second came, saying, Master, your mina has earned five minas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.19'>Likewise he said to him, You also be over five cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.20'>Then another came, saying, Master, here is your mina, which I have kept put away in a handkerchief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.21'>For I feared you, because you are a harsh man. You take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.22'>And he said to him, Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was a harsh man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.23'>Why then did you not put my money in the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.24'>And he said to those who stood by, Take the mina from him, and give it to him who has ten minas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.25'>But they said to him, Master, he has ten minas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.26'>For I say to you, that to everyone who has will be given; and from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.27'>But bring here those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, and slay them before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.28'>When He had said this, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.29'>And it came to pass, when He came near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mountain called Olivet, that He sent two of His disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.30'>saying, Go into the village opposite you, where as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Loose it and bring it here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.31'>And if anyone asks you, Why are you loosing it? you shall say to him, Because the Lord has need of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.32'>So those who were sent went their way and found it just as He had said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said to them, Why are you loosing the colt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>And they said, The Lord has need of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.35'>Then they led it to Jesus. And they threw their clothes on the colt, and they set Jesus on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>And as He went, they spread their clothes on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>And as He was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>saying: Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in Heaven and glory in the highest!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.39'>And some of the Pharisees called to Him from the crowd, Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.40'>But He answered and said to them, I tell you that if these should keep silent, the stones would immediately cry out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>And as He drew near, He saw the city and wept over it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.42'>saying, If you had known, even you, at least in this your day, the things that make for your peace. But now they are hidden from your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.43'>For days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, surround you and besiege you on every side,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.44'>and tear you down, and your children within you, to the ground; and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not know the time of your visitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.45'>And He went into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.46'>saying to them, It is written, My house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.47'>And He was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests, the scribes, and the chief of the people sought to destroy Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.48'>and were unable to figure out anything to do; for all the people hung on to hear Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>And it happened on one of those days, as He taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel, that the chief priests and the scribes, together with the elders, came up</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>and spoke to Him, saying, Tell us, by what authority are You doing these things? Or who is he who gave You this authority?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>But He answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, and answer Me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>The immersion of John; was it from Heaven or from men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From Heaven, He will say, Why then did you not believe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>So they answered that they did not know where it was from.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>And Jesus said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>Then He began to tell the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard, leased it to vinedressers, and went into a far country for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>Now at the right time he sent a servant to the vinedressers, that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the vinedressers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>And again he sent another servant; and they beat him also, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also and cast him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>Then the owner of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him when they see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, so that the inheritance may become ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and destroy these vinedressers and give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it they said, Let it not be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>And He looked at them and said, What then is this that is written: The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>Whoever falls on that stone will be broken in pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will crush him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>And the chief priests and the scribes that same hour sought to lay hands on Him, but they feared the people; for they knew He had spoken this parable against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>So they watched Him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might seize on one of His words, in order to deliver Him to the power and the authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>Then they asked Him, saying, Teacher, we know that You say and teach rightly, and You do not show personal regard, but teach the way of God in truth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But He perceived their craftiness, and said to them, Why do you test Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have? They answered and said, Caesars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>And He said to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>And they could not catch Him in His words in the presence of the people. And they marveled at His answer and kept silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, came to Him and asked Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>saying: Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a mans brother dies, having a wife, and he dies without children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>Now there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife, and died without children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>And the second took her as wife, and he died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>Then the third took her, and in like manner the seven also; and they left no children, and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife is she? For the seven had her as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And Jesus answered and said to them, The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>But those who are counted worthy to attain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>nor is it possible for them to die anymore, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>But even Moses showed at the bush that the dead are raised, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>For He is not the God of the dead but of the living, for all live to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>Then some of the scribes answered and said, Teacher, You have well said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>And after that they dared not question Him anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>And He said to them, How do they say that the Christ is the Son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>Now David himself said in the Book of Psalms: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>till I make Your enemies Your footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>Therefore David calls Him Lord; how is He then his Son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>Then, in the hearing of all the people, He said to His disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>Beware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, love greetings in the marketplaces, the chief seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at feasts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>who devour widows houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.21'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.1'>And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.2'>and He saw also a certain poor widow putting in two mites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.3'>And He said, Truly I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than everyone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.4'>for all these out of their abundance have put in offerings for God, but she out of her poverty put in all the livelihood that she had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.5'>And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and donations, He said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.6'>As for these things which you see; the days will come in which not one stone shall be left upon another that shall not be thrown down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.7'>So they asked Him, saying, Teacher, therefore when will these things be? And what sign will there be when these things are about to take place?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.8'>And He said: Take heed that you not be led astray. For many will come in My name, saying, I AM, and, The time is here. Therefore do not go after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.9'>But when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified; for these things must come to pass first, but the end is not immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.10'>Then He said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.11'>And there will be great earthquakes from place to place, and famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.12'>But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and rulers on account of My name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.13'>But it will turn to you for testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.14'>Therefore settle it in your hearts not to premeditate a defense;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.15'>for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to contradict or resist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.16'>And you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.17'>And you will be hated by all because of My name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.18'>But not a hair of your head shall at all perish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.20'>But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.21'>Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those who are in the midst of her depart, and let not those who are in the country enter her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.23'>But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.24'>And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem will be trampled by Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.25'>And there will be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.26'>mens hearts failing them from fear and the expectation of the things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.27'>And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.28'>And when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.29'>Then He spoke to them a parable: Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.30'>When they are already budding, you see and know for yourselves that summer is now near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.31'>So you also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.32'>Truly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all things take place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.33'>Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.34'>But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with giddiness, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that Day come upon you unexpectedly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.35'>For it will come as a snare on all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.36'>Watch therefore, and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.37'>And in the daytime He was teaching in the temple, but at night He went out and stayed on the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.38'>And early in the morning all the people came to Him in the temple to hear Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.22'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.1'>Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.2'>And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill Him, for they feared the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.3'>Then Satan entered Judas, surnamed Iscariot, being numbered among the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>So he went his way and conferred with the chief priests and commanders, how he might deliver Him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>And they were glad, and agreed to give him money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>So he promised and sought opportunity to deliver Him to them away from the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover must be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>And He sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.9'>So they said to Him, Where do You want us to prepare?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.10'>And He said to them, Behold, when you have entered the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house which he enters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.11'>Then you shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.12'>And he will show you a large, furnished upper room; there make ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.13'>So they went and found it just as He had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>And when the hour had come, He sat down, and the twelve apostles with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.15'>And He said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.16'>for I say to you, I will no longer eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.17'>Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this and divide it among yourselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.18'>for I say to you, I will not drink from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.19'>And He took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.20'>Likewise He also took the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the New Covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.21'>But behold, the hand of My betrayer is with Me on the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.22'>And truly the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.23'>Then they began to question among themselves, which of them it might be who was about to do this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.24'>And there was also a dispute among them, as to which of them should be considered greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.25'>And He said to them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called benefactors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.26'>But not so among you; rather, he who is greater among you, let him be as the younger, and he who leads as he who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.27'>For who is greater, he who sits at the table, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as the One who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.28'>But you are those who have continued with Me in My trials.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.29'>And I appoint a kingdom to you, as My Father appointed unto Me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.30'>that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.31'>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon. Behold, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.32'>But I have prayed for you, that your faith does not fail; and when you have returned, strengthen your brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.33'>But he said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.34'>Then He said, I tell you, Peter, the rooster shall not crow this day before you will deny three times that you know Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.35'>And He said to them, When I sent you without money bag, knapsack, and sandals, did you lack anything? And they said, Nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.36'>Then He said to them, But now, he who has a money bag, let him take it, and likewise a knapsack; and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.37'>For I say to you that this which is written must still be accomplished in Me: And He was numbered with the transgressors. For the things concerning Me have an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.38'>And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And He said to them, It is enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>And coming out, He went to the Mount of Olives, as He was accustomed, and His disciples also followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>And when He came to the place, He said to them, Pray that you do not enter into temptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>And He was withdrawn from them about a stones throw, and He knelt down and prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>saying, Father, if You are willing, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>Then an angel appeared to Him from Heaven, strengthening Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. And His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>And when He rose up from prayer, and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>And He said to them, Why do you sleep? Rise and pray, that you do not enter into temptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>And while He was still speaking, behold, a multitude; and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.48'>But Jesus said to him, Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.49'>When those around Him saw what was about to happen, they said to Him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.50'>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.51'>But Jesus answered and said, Permit even this. And He touched his ear and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, commanders of the temple, and the elders who had come to Him, Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>When I was with you daily in the temple, you did not stretch forth your hands against Me. But this is your hour, and the authority of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>And having arrested Him, they led Him away and brought Him into the high priests house. And Peter followed at a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>Now when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>And a certain servant girl, seeing him as he sat by the fire, looked intently at him and said, This man was also with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>But he denied Him, saying, Woman, I do not know Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>And after a little while another saw him and said, You also are of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>Then after about an hour had passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, Truly this fellow also was with Him, for he is a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>But Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are saying. Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>And Peter went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>Now the men who held Jesus mocked Him and beat Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>And having blindfolded Him, they struck Him on the face and asked Him, saying, Prophesy! Who is the one who struck You?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And many other things they blasphemously spoke against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, came together and led Him into their council, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>If You are the Christ, tell us. But He said to them, If I tell you, you will by no means believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>And if I also ask you, you will by no means answer Me or let Me go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>Hereafter the Son of Man will sit on the right hand of the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.70'>Then they all said, Are You then the Son of God? And He said to them, You affirm that I AM.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.71'>And they said, What further testimony do we need? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>Then the whole multitude of them arose and led Him before Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this one perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>Then Pilate asked Him, saying, Are You the King of the Jews? He answered him and said, It is as you say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>So Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, I find no fault in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they were the more insistent, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the Man were a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>And as soon as he knew that He belonged to Herods jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad; for he had desired for a long time to see Him, because he had heard many things about Him, and he hoped to see some sign done by Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>Then he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>Then Herod, with his men of war, treated Him with contempt and mocked Him, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>And the same day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for previously they had been at enmity with each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>Then Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>said to them, You have brought this Man to me, as one who misleads the people. And indeed, having examined Him in your presence, I have found no fault in this Man concerning those things of which you accuse Him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>no, neither did Herod, for I sent you back to him; and indeed nothing deserving of death has been done by Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>I will therefore chastise Him and release Him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>(for it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>And they all cried out at once, saying, Away with this Man, and release to us Barabbas;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>who had been thrown into prison for a certain rebellion made in the city, and for murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>But they shouted, saying, Crucify Him, crucify Him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>Then he said to them the third time, Why, what evil has He done? I have found no reason for death in Him. I will therefore chastise Him and let Him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And the voices of these men and of the chief priests prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>So Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they requested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And he released to them the one they requested, who for rebellion and murder had been thrown into prison; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>Now as they led Him away, they laid hold of a certain man, Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And a great multitude of the people followed Him, and women who also mourned and bewailed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus, turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For behold the days are coming in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, wombs that never bore, and breasts which never nursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! and to the hills, Cover us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they do these things in the green wood, what will be done in the dry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>There were also two others, criminals, led with Him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they had come to the place called Skull, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>And they divided His garments and cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people stood looking on. Moreover the rulers with them sneered, saying, He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the chosen of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And an inscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>And one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this Man has done nothing wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>Then he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus said to him, Truly, I say to you, Today you will be with Me in Paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>Now it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice, He said, Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit. Having said this, He breathed out the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>So when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, Truly this was a righteous Man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And the whole crowd who came together to that sight, seeing the things that happened, beat their breasts and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>But all His acquaintances, and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And behold, there was a man named Joseph, a council member, a good and just man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>He had not consented to their decision and deed. He was from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And he took it down, wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock, where no one had ever lain before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And that day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>And they returned and prepared spices and ointments. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>Now on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they, and certain other women with them, came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>But they found the stone having been rolled away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>And they went in and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it happened, as they were greatly perplexed about this, that behold, two men stood by them in shining garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>And, as they were terrified and bowed their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why do you seek the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but is risen! Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>saying, The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered His words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>And they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of Jacob, and the other women with them, who told these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And their words seemed to them like idle nonsense, and they did not believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Peter arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying by themselves; and he departed, wondering to himself at what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>Now behold, two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was seven miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>So it was, while they conversed and reasoned, that Jesus Himself drew near and went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were held, so that they did not recognize Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And He said to them, What kind of conversation is this that you have with one another as you walk and are sad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>Then the one whose name was Cleopas answered and said to Him, Are You only a stranger in Jerusalem, and do not know the things which happened there in these days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And He said to them, What things? So they said to Him, The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and crucified Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>Yes, and certain women of our company, who arrived at the tomb early, astonished us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>And when they did not find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said He is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And certain of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Then He said to them, O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they drew near to the village where they were going, and He made as though He would have gone farther.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they constrained Him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And He went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it came to pass, as He sat at the table with them, that He took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And their eyes were opened and they knew Him; and He vanished from their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said to one another, Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us on the road, and while He opened the Scriptures to us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>So they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying, The Lord truly is risen, and has appeared to Simon!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they told about the things that had happened on the road, and how He was known to them in the breaking of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>And as they were saying these things, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, Peace to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed they were seeing a ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And He said to them, Why are you troubled? And why do reasonings arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Handle Me and see, for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>But while they still did not believe for joy, and marveled, He said to them, Have you any food here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>So they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>And He took it and ate in their presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>Then He said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>And He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>And He said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and that repentance and remission of sins be preached in His name to all nations, beginning out of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>And you are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you; but stay in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it came to pass, while He blessed them, that He was parted from them and carried up into Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And they did homage to Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God. Amen.</verse>
