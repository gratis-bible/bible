  <div osisID='1Cor' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, appointed an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all who in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that you were enriched in everything in Him in all utterance and all knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that you are not lacking in any gift, patiently waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who will also confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now I exhort you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be completely fitted together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of Chloes household, that there are contentions among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>Now I say this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you immersed into the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I thank God that I immersed none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>that no one should say that I had immersed into my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>Yes, I also immersed the household of Stephanas. Besides that, I do not know whether I immersed any others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ did not send me to immerse, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the understanding of the intelligent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who are believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>For Jews request a sign, and Greeks seek after wisdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we preach Christ crucified, truly to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For you see your calling, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many of nobility.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are mighty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>and the low-born of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>that no flesh should boast in His presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But out of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who was made for us from God wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>that, as it is written, He who exults, let him exult in the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the Testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>And my speech and my preaching were not with enticing words of human wisdom, but in proof of the Spirit and of power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>However, we speak wisdom among those who are mature; but not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, having been hidden, which God appointed before the ages for our glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>which none of the rulers of this age knew; for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But as it is written: Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it dawned upon the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>These things we also speak, not in words which human wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he is not able to know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But he who is spiritual discerns all things, yet he himself is discerned by no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able, and even now you are still not able;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>for you are still carnal. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and behaving like men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For when one says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not carnal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believe, as the Lord gave to each one?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, Apollos watered, but God made it grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who causes growth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are Gods fellow workers; you are Gods field, Gods building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For no one is able to lay any other foundation than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>each ones work will be revealed; for the Day will declare it, because it will be disclosed by fire; and the fire will test each ones work, of what sort it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If anyones work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If anyones work is consumed, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become foolish that he may become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He catches the wise in their own craftiness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>and again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come; all are yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>And you are Christs, and Christ is Gods.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let a man so consider us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Moreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by a human day in court. In fact, I do not even judge myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For I know nothing against myself, yet I am not justified by this; but He who judges me is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each ones praise will be from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that you may learn in us not to think beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up one over the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who makes you differ from another? And what do you have that you did not receive? Now if you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>You are already full. You are already rich. You have reigned as kings without us; and indeed I wish you truly did reign, that we also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last, as men condemned to death; for we became spectacles to all creation, both to angels and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are foolish because of Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are distinguished, but we are dishonored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and we are poorly clothed, and beaten, and wander homeless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>And we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>being defamed, we entreat. We have become as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I admonish you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For though you might have countless instructors in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>Therefore I urge you, be imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>Everywhere it is heard that there is sexual perversion among you, and such sexual perversion as is not even named among the Gentiles; that a man has his fathers wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this deed might be removed out from among your midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For indeed, as absent in body but present in spirit, I have already judged him who has so done this deed, as though I were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Therefore purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote to you in my epistle not to keep company with sexually immoral people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>Yet I certainly did not mean with the sexually immoral people of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; not even to eat with such a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>But those who are outside God judges. Therefore put away from among yourselves the evil person.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to court before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Do you not know that we shall judge angels? To say nothing of things that pertain to this life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>If then you have judgments concerning things pertaining to this life, you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise person among you, not even one, who will be able to judge between his brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But brother goes to court against brother, and that before unbelievers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Now therefore, it is already an utter failure with you that you go to court against one another. Why do you not rather accept wrong? Why do you not rather be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>No, you yourselves do wrong and defraud, and these things to brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be led astray. Neither prostitutes, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be enslaved under the power of any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for sexual perversion but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>And God both raised up the Lord and will also raise us up through His power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a harlot? Let it not be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Or do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body? For the two, He says, shall become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee sexual perversion. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are Gods.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning the things of which you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>Nevertheless, because of sexual perversion, let each have his own wife, and let each have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not deprive one another except by agreement for a time, that you may be free for fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But I say this by permission, not by commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>For I wish that all men were even as myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain even as I am;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>but if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>Now to the married I command, yet not I but the Lord: A wife is not to leave her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>But, indeed, in case she does leave, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband is not to send away his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>But to the rest I say, not the Lord: If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is willing to live with him, let him not send her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, if he is willing to live with her, let her not leave him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>But if the unbeliever leaves, let them leave; a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases. But God has called us in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.16'>For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.17'>But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I command in all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.18'>Was anyone called while circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.19'>Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>Were you called while a slave? Do not be concerned about it; but if you are able to be made free, rather use it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>For he who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lords freedman. Likewise he who is called while free is Christs slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.23'>You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.24'>Brethren, let each one remain with God however he was called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.25'>Now concerning virgins: I have no commandment from the Lord; yet I give judgment as one who, having received mercy from the Lord, is faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.26'>I suppose therefore that this is good because of the present necessity; that it is good for a man to be thus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.27'>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.28'>But also if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such will have trouble in the flesh, but I am sparing you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.29'>But this I say, brethren, the time has been shortened, so that even those who have wives should be as though they had none,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.30'>those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.31'>and those who use this world as not using it up. For the form of this world is passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.32'>But I want you to be free from anxiety. He who is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord; how to please the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.33'>But he who is married cares about the things of the world; how to please his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>There is a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world; how to please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a leash on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>But if any man thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of youth, and it is the duty, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin; let him marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has control over his own will, and has so determined in his heart that he will keep himself a virgin, does well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So then he who gives in marriage does well, but he who does not give in marriage does better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A wife is bound by Law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is at liberty to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.40'>But she is happier if she remains so, according to my judgment; and I think I also have the Spirit of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.1'>Now concerning sacrifices to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.2'>And if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.3'>But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.4'>Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.7'>However, there is not in everyone that knowledge; for some, with consciousness of the idol, until now eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.8'>But food does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat do we excel, nor if we do not eat are we lacking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.9'>But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.10'>For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idols temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat things offered to idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.11'>And because of your knowledge the weak brother will perish, the one for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.12'>But when you sin in this way against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.13'>Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat flesh, so that I not make my brother stumble.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, we clothe them with greater honor; and our unpresentable parts have abundant elegance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>but our presentable parts have no need. But God composed the body, having given more abundant honor to that part which is lacking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, governings, tongues of nationalities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.29'>Not everyone is an apostle are they? Not everyone is a prophet? Not everyone is a teacher? Not everyone is a worker of power?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.30'>Not everyone has gifts of healing? Not everyone speaks with tongues? Not everyone interprets?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.31'>But earnestly desire the more useful gifts. And yet I show you a way according to excellence.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>If I were to speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become as sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>And if I were to have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I were to have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>And if I were to bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and if I were to give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>Love is longsuffering and is kind; love does not envy; love does not boast itself, is not puffed up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>does not behave indecently, does not seek its own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>Love never fails. But if there are prophecies, they will come to an end; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will come to an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>For we know in part and we prophesy in part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>But when the complete whole comes, then that which is in part will come to an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put an end to childish things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.13'>And now remain faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Pursue love, and be zealous over spiritual matters, but rather that you may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God, for no one understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But he who prophesies speaks to men for building up and exhortation and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He who speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but he who prophesies builds up the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>I wish you all spoke with tongues, but rather that you prophesied; for he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless indeed he interprets, that the church may receive building up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation, by knowledge, by prophesying, or by teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>Even things without life, whether flute or harp, when they make a sound, unless they present different musical notes, how will it be known what is piped or played?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>For if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>So likewise you, if you do not utter by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are, it may be, so many ethnic languages in the world, and none of them is without its own speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>Therefore, if I do not know the dynamics of the language, I shall be a foreigner to him who speaks, and he who speaks will be a foreigner to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>Even so you, since you are zealous for spiritual matters, seek to excel in the building up of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>Otherwise, if you praise in the spirit, how will he who occupies the place set apart for the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you say?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not built up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank my God I speak with tongues more than every one of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brethren, do not be children in understanding; however, in malice be infants, but in understanding be mature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the Law it is written: With men of other languages and other lips I will speak to this people; And yet, for all that, they will not hear Me, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>Therefore if the whole church comes together in one place, and everyone speaks in tongues, and there come in those who are unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that you are not in your right minds?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if everyone prophesies, and an unbeliever or an unlearned person comes in, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>And thus the secrets of his heart become revealed; and so, falling down on his face, he will do homage to God and proclaim that God is truly among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>How is it then, brethren? Whenever you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at the most three, each in turn, and let one interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others discern.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>But if anything is revealed to another who sits by, let the first keep silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For you can each prophesy one by one, that everyone may learn and everyone may be encouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>Let your women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they are to be in subjection, as the Law also says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>And if they desire to learn something, let them question their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>Or did the Word of God go forth from you? Or did it come only to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>Therefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>Let all things be done decently and in order.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>by which also you are being kept safe, if you hold fast that Word which I preached to you; unless you believe in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>and that He was buried, and that He was raised the third day according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until the present time, but some have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>After that He was seen by Jacob, then by each of the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one of untimely birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than every one of them, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>Therefore, whether it was I or they, so we preach and so you believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain and your faith is also vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>Yes, and we are found to be false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up; if in fact the dead are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But now Christ has been raised from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For since through man came death, through Man also came the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For as in Adam everyone dies, even so in Christ everyone shall be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who are Christs at His coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God, even the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For it is necessary for Him to reign till He has put every enemy under His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy that will be destroyed is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>For He has subjected everything under His feet. But when He says everything is subjected, it is evident that He who subjected everything under Him is exempt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>Now when everything is subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subjected to Him who subjected everything under Him, that God may be everything in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Otherwise, what will they do who are immersed for the dead, if the dead are not truly raised? Why then are they immersed for the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>And why are we in danger every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>I affirm, by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die throughout the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>If like other men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what profit is it to me, if the dead are not raised? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Do not be led astray: Evil company corrupts good character.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Awake to righteousness, and do not sin; for some do not have the knowledge of God. I speak to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But someone will say, How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>Foolish one, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>And what you sow, you do not sow the body that shall be, but mere grain; perhaps wheat or something else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>But God gives it a body as He purposed, and to each seed its own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>Not every flesh is the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies; but the brightness of the heavenly is one, and the brightness of the earthly is another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is one brightness of the sun, another brightness of the moon, and another brightness of the stars; for one star differs from another star in brightness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>And so it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul; the last Adam a life-giving Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man was out of the earth, of dust; the second Man is the Lord out of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>As is the man of dust, so also are those of dust; and as is the Man from Heaven, so also are those of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>And as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the Man of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God; nor does corruption inherit incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For this corruptible needs to put on incorruption, and this mortal needs to put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.16'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.1'>Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, so also you do:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.2'>On the first day of the week let each one of you lay something aside, storing up from whatever he is prospered, that there be no collections when I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.3'>And when I come, whomever you approve through letters I will send to carry your good will to Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.12'>Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brethren, but it was not at all his desire to come at this time; however, he will come when he has opportunity.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.14'>Let all that you do be done with love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.15'>I encourage you, brethren; you know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have appointed themselves to the ministry of the saints;</verse>
