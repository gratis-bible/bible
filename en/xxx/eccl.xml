      <chapter osisID='Eccl.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.1'>The words of the preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.2'>Vanity of vanities, says the preacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.3'>What is the profit to a man in all his labor which he labors under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.4'>A generation passes away, and a generation comes; but the earth stands perpetually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.5'>The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, panting in a hurry to its place where it rises again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.6'>The wind goes toward the south, and it turns around to the north; it whirls around continually; and the wind returns according to its circuits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.7'>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; to the place from where the rivers come, there they return again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.8'>All things are full of labor; man is not able to utter it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.9'>That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done; and there is nothing new under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.10'>Is there a thing of which it may be said, See, this is new? It has already been in the days of antiquity, which were before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.11'>There is no remembrance of former things, and also no remembrance of following things of what will be; nor a remembrance of those things by those who follow afterwards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.12'>I, the preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.13'>And I have given my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that which is done under the heavens. It is an evil task which God has given to the sons of men to be busied with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.14'>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and striving of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.15'>What is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is lacking cannot be numbered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.16'>I spoke within my own heart, saying, Lo, I have become great and have gathered more wisdom than all who have been before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart has seen much of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.17'>And I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I have perceived that this also is striving of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.18'>For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.1'>I said in my heart, Come now, I will test you with mirth; therefore regard pleasure; and this was vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.2'>I said of laughter, It is madness; and of mirth, What does it accomplish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.3'>I sought in my heart to gratify my flesh with wine, while leading my heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, until I might find out what was good for the sons of men to do under the heavens all the days of their life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.4'>I made my works great; I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.5'>I made gardens and orchards for myself, and I planted trees in them, of all kinds of fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.6'>I made pools of water for myself, to water the forest springing up with trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.7'>I have bought slaves and maids, and had servants born in my house; I also had more livestock, herds and flocks, than all were before me in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.8'>I also gathered silver and gold to myself, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got men singers and women singers for myself, and the delights of the sons of men, wives and concubines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.9'>I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.10'>And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I did not withhold my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor, and this was my share from all my labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.11'>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and striving of spirit; and there was no profit under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.12'>And I turned myself to consider wisdom and madness and folly; for what can the man do who comes after the king, when it has already been done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.13'>Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.14'>The wise mans eyes are in his head; but the fool walks in darkness; and I also considered that one event happens to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.15'>Then I said in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it happens even to me; and why was I then more wise? And I said in my heart that this also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.16'>For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever, since that which is now shall all be forgotten in the days to come. And how does the wise man die? Same as the fool!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.17'>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is done under the sun is evil to me; for all is vanity and striving of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.18'>Yes, I hated all my labor which I had done under the sun; because I must leave it to the man who shall come after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.19'>And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he shall have rule over all my labor in which I have labored, and acted wisely under the sun. This also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.20'>Therefore I turned my heart to despair over all the labor in which I had labored under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.21'>For there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and with success; yet he shall leave it as inheritance to a man who has not labored in it. This also is vanity and a great evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.22'>For what has man from all his labor, and from the striving of his heart, in which he has labored under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.23'>For all his days are sorrows, and his task grief; yea, his heart does not take rest in the night. This also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.24'>Is it not good for a man to eat and drink and make his soul behold the good in his labor. This also, I saw, that it was from the hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.25'>For who can eat, or who can enjoy, apart from Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.26'>For God gives wisdom, and knowledge, and joy to a man who is good in His sight. But to the sinner He gives labor, to collect and gather, that he may give to him who is good before God. This also is vanity and striving of spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.1'>To every thing there is a season, and a time for every purpose under the heavens:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.2'>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to root up what is planted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.3'>a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.4'>a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.5'>a time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.6'>a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to throw away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.7'>a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.8'>a time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.9'>What profit does he have who works in that in which he labors?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.10'>I have seen the task which God has given to the sons of men to keep busy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.11'>He has made everything beautiful in its time; also He has set eternity in their hearts, so that no man can find out the work that God has made from the beginning to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.12'>I know that there is no good for man, but to rejoice and to do good in his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.13'>And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labor; it is the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.14'>I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it; and God does it so that men should fear before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.15'>That which has been, is now; and that which is to be, already has been; and God exacts what is pursued.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.16'>Moreover I saw under the sun in the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.17'>I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.18'>I said in my heart concerning the manner of the sons of men, that God tests them, that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.19'>For that which happens to the sons of men also happens to beasts, even one thing happens to them. As this one dies, so that one dies; yea, they all have one breath; so that a man has no advantage over a beast; for all is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.20'>All go to one place; all are of the dust, and all return to dust again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.21'>Who knows the spirit of man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.22'>Therefore I have seen that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion; for who can bring him to see what shall be after him?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.1'>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold the tears of the oppressed ones, and they had no comforter! And on the side of those who oppressed them there was power, but they had no comforter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.2'>Therefore I congratulated the dead who already have died, more than the living who are still alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.3'>Yea, better than both is he who has never existed, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.4'>Again, I considered all labor, and every successful work, that for this a man is envied by his neighbor. This also is vanity and striving of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.5'>The fool folds his hands together, and devours his own flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.6'>Better is a hand filled with rest than two hands full with travail and striving of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.7'>Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.8'>There is one alone, without a second; indeed, he has neither son nor brother; yet there is no end to all his labor; and his eyes are not satisfied with riches; and he does not ask, For whom do I labor and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity; indeed, it is an evil task.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.9'>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.10'>For if they fall, the one will lift up his companion; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, for he does not have another to help him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.11'>Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.12'>And if one overpowers him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.13'>A poor and wise youth is better than an old and foolish king, who will not be admonished any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.14'>For he comes out of prison to reign; although in his kingdom he was poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.15'>I saw all the living who walk under the sun, with the second youth who stands in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.16'>There is no end of all the people, of all who have been before them; they also who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and striving of spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.1'>Guard your feet when you go to the house of God, and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools. For they do not know that they are doing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.2'>Do not be rash with your mouth, and do not let your heart be hasty to say a word before God. For God is in Heaven, and you are on earth; therefore let your words be few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.3'>For a dream comes through much activity; and a fools voice by the multitude of words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.4'>When you vow a vow to God, do not hesitate to pay it; for He has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which you have vowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.5'>It is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.6'>Do not permit your mouth to cause your flesh to sin; do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.7'>For in the multitude of dreams and increasing of words there is also vanity; but fear God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.8'>If you see the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, do not be astonished at the matter; for He who is higher than the highest watches; so there are those higher than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.9'>And the advantage of the land is for all; even a king has fields being tilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.10'>He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he who loves abundance, with gain. This also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.11'>When the goods increase, those who eat it increase; what profit is it, then, to its owners, except to see it with their eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.12'>The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.13'>There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun: riches kept for their owners to their hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.14'>But those riches perish by evil use. And he begets a son, and there is nothing in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.15'>As he came forth from his mothers womb, naked he shall return, to go as he came. And from his labor he shall take away nothing that he may carry in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.16'>And this also is a sore evil, that in all, as he came, so shall he go; and what profit does he have who has labored for the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.17'>All his days he eats in darkness, and he has much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.18'>Behold that which I have seen: It is good and right for one to eat and to drink, and to see good in all his labor that he labors under the sun all the days of his life, which God gives him; for it is his portion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.19'>Also every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.20'>For he does not excessively dwell on the days of his life, because God keeps him busy in the joy of his heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.1'>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is widespread among men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.2'>A man to whom God has given riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to eat of it, but a foreigner devours it. This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.3'>If a man begets a hundred, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, and his soul is not filled with goodness, and there is also for him no burial; I say, a miscarriage is better than he;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.4'>for it comes in with vanity and goes out in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.5'>Also it has not seen the sun, nor known anything. This one has more rest than the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.6'>Yea, though he lives twice a thousand years, yet he has seen no goodness. Do not all go to one place?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.7'>All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the soul is not satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.8'>For what has the wise more than the fool? What does the poor have, who knows how to walk before the living?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.9'>Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This is also vanity and striving of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.10'>That which one is, he has been named already, and it is known that he is man. And he is not able to contend with Him who is mightier than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.11'>Since there are many things that increase vanity, how is man any better?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.12'>For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spends as a shadow? For who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.7'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.1'>A good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of ones birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.2'>It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men; and the living will take it to heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.3'>Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the face the heart is made better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.4'>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.5'>It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.6'>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool; this also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.7'>Surely oppression makes a fool out of a wise man; and a bribe destroys the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.8'>Better is the end of a thing than the beginning of it; the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.9'>Do not be hasty in your spirit to be angry; for anger rests in the bosom of fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.10'>Do not say, Why were the former days better than these? For you do not ask wisely concerning this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.11'>Wisdom is good with an inheritance, and profitable to those who see the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.12'>For wisdom is a defense, and money is a defense; but the excellence of knowledge is, that wisdom gives life to those who have it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.13'>Consider the work of God; for who can make straight what He has made crooked?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.14'>In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity take note that God also has ordained the one next to the other, in order that man should not find anything after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.15'>I have seen everything in the days of my vanity: There is a just one who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked one who prolongs life in his wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.16'>Do not be overly righteous, nor be overly wise; why should you destroy yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.17'>Do not be overly wicked, and do not be a fool; why should you die before your time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.18'>It is good that you should grasp this; yea, also from this do not withdraw your hand; for he who fears God shall come forth out from them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.19'>Wisdom makes the wise stronger than ten who dominate the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.20'>For there is not a just man on earth who does good and does not sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.21'>Also do not take to heart all words that are spoken; lest you hear your servant curse you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.22'>For your own heart knows that you yourself have also cursed others many times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.23'>All this I have proved by wisdom; I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.24'>As for that which is far off and exceedingly deep, who can find it out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.25'>I set my heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.26'>and I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands like fetters. Whoever pleases God shall escape from her, but the sinner shall be captured by her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.27'>Behold, this I have found, says the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the reckoning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.28'>which my soul still seeks, but I find not. One man among a thousand I have found, but a woman among all those I have not found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.29'>Lo, this only I have found, that God has made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Eccl.8'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.1'>Who is as the wise? And who knows the explanation of a thing? A mans wisdom makes his face shine, and the strength of his face is changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.2'>I say, Keep the kings edict, because of the oath of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.3'>Do not be hasty to leave his presence. Do not take a stand in an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.4'>because in the word of a king is power; and who may say to him, What are you doing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.5'>Whoever keeps the command shall experience no evil decree; and a wise mans heart discerns both time and judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.6'>Because for every desire there is a time and judgment, for the evil of man increases greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.7'>For he does not know what shall be; so who can tell him when it shall be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.8'>No one has power over the spirit to restrain the spirit; nor power in the day of death; and there is no discharge from that war; nor shall wickedness deliver its owners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.9'>All this I have seen, and I gave my heart to every work that is done under the sun. There is a time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.10'>And so I saw the wicked buried, they who had come and gone from the consecrated place. And they were forgotten in the city where they had done so. This also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.11'>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.12'>Though a sinner does evil a hundred times, and his days are prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with those who fear God, who fear before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.13'>But it shall not be well with the wicked, nor shall he prolong his days, which are like a shadow; because he does not fear before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.14'>There is a vanity which is done on the earth: There are just ones to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked ones to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.15'>Then I praised gladness, because a man has no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be glad; for that shall remain with him of his labor for the days of his life which God gives him under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.16'>When I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on the earth, not seeing sleep with the eyes, day or night;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.17'>then I looked at all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun; because though a man labors to seek it out, yet he shall not find it. Moreover, though a wise one speaks of knowing, yet he shall not be able to find it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.9'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.1'>For all this I took to heart, in order to explain it: that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God. No man knows, whether by love or hatred, all that is before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.2'>All happens alike to everyone; there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him who sacrifices, and to him who does not sacrifice. As is the good, so is the sinner. He who swears is as he who fears an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.3'>This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event to all. Yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.4'>For whoever is chosen, of all those living, there is confidence; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.5'>For the living know that they shall die; but the dead do not know anything, nor do they have any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.6'>Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, have now perished; nor do they ever any longer have a part in anything that is done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.7'>Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.8'>Let your garments always be white; and let your head lack no ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.9'>Look on life with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life, which He has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity. For that is your share in this life, and in your labor which you labor under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.10'>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might; for there is no work nor reasoning nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol where you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.11'>I returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happens to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.12'>For man also does not know his time; as the fish that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.13'>This wisdom I have seen also under the sun, and it seemed great to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.14'>There was a little city with few men in it; and a great king came against it and besieged it, and built huge bulwarks against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.15'>And a poor wise man was found in it, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no one remembered that poor man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.16'>And I said, Wisdom is better than strength; but the poor mans wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.17'>The words of the wise are heard in quiet, more than the shouts of him who rules among fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.18'>Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroys much good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.10'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.1'>As dead flies cause the perfumers ointment to stink and ferment; so does a little folly to one esteemed for wisdom and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.2'>A wise mans heart is at his right hand; but a fools heart at his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.3'>Even when a fool walks along the way, his heart fails; and he says to everyone that he is a fool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.4'>If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, remain quietly where you are; for quietness heals great offenses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.5'>There is an evil I have seen under the sun, like an error which comes from a rulers presence:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.6'>Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.7'>I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking on the ground like servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.8'>He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a hedge may be bitten by a snake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.9'>Whoever removes stones may be hurt by them; and he who splits wood may be endangered by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.10'>If the iron is blunt, and he does not whet the edge, then he must exert more strength. But wisdom gives excellent success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.11'>The snake may bite if it is not charmed; and a master of the tongue is no better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.12'>The words of a wise mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.13'>The words of his mouth begin with foolishness; and the end of his talk is wicked madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.14'>A fool also multiplies words; a man does not know what shall be; and who can tell him what shall be after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.15'>The labor of fools wearies him, because he does not even know how to go to the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.16'>Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your rulers eat in the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.17'>Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your rulers eat at the proper time, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.18'>Because of laziness the building decays; and through idleness of hands the house leaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.19'>Food is made for laughter, and wine makes merry; but money is the answer to everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.20'>Do not curse the king, not even in your thoughts; and do not curse the rich, not even in your bedroom; for a bird of the air may carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.11'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.1'>Cast your bread upon the waters; for you shall find it after many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.2'>Give a share to seven, and also to eight; for you do not know what evil shall be on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.3'>If the clouds are full of rain, they empty upon the earth; and if the tree falls toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.4'>He who watches the wind will not sow; and he who pays attention to the clouds will not reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.5'>As you do not know what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones grow in the womb of a pregnant woman; even so you do not know the works of God who makes everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.6'>In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not withhold your hand; for you do not know which shall be blessed, either this or that, or whether they both alike shall be good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.7'>Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.8'>But if a man lives many years, and rejoices in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that has come is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.9'>Rejoice in your youth, young man; and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes; but know that for all these things, God will bring you into judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.10'>Therefore remove vexation from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh; for childhood and black hair of youth are vanity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.12'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.1'>Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth, so that the evil days do not come, nor the years draw near, when you shall say, I have no pleasure in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.2'>While the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.3'>in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men bow down, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those who look out of the windows are darkened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.4'>and the doors are shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and one rises up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song are silenced;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.5'>also they are afraid of the heights, and terrors along the way, and the almond tree blossoms, and the grasshopper is a burden, and desire fails; because man goes to his eternal home, and the mourners go about the streets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.6'>or before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.8'>Vanity of vanities, says the preacher; all is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.9'>And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. Yes, he pondered, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.10'>The preacher sought to learn acceptable words; written words of uprightness and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.11'>The words of the wise are like goads, and as nails from the collection, fastened by the Master, given from one Shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.12'>And further, by these, my son, be admonished: The making of many books has no end, and much study is a weariness to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.13'>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep His commandments; for this is for every man.</verse>
