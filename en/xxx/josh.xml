      <chapter osisID='Josh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'>And after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, it came to pass that Jehovah spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses minister, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'>Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land which I am giving to them; to the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon I have given to you, as I have said to Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'>From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'>No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not abandon you nor forsake you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'>Be strong and of good courage, for to this people you shall divide as an inheritance the land which I have sworn to their fathers to give to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'>Only be strong and very courageous, that you may take heed to do according to all the Law which Moses My servant has commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'>This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may take heed to do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'>Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'>Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are crossing over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving you to possess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'>And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua spoke, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'>Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God is giving you rest and has given you this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'>Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land which Moses has given you on this side of the Jordan. But you shall pass before your brethren armed, all your mighty men of valor, and help them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'>until Jehovah has given your brethren rest, as He has given you, and they also have taken possession of the land which Jehovah your God is giving to them. Then you shall return to possess the land of your inheritance, which Moses the servant of Jehovah has given you on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'>So they answered Joshua, saying, All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'>Just as we have heeded Moses in all things, so we will heed you. Only Jehovah your God be with you, as He was with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'>Whoever rebels against your mouth and does not heed your words, in all that you command him, shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'>And Joshua the son of Nun sent out two men from Shittim to spy secretly, saying, Go, view the land, especially Jericho. So they went, and came to the house of a harlot woman named Rahab, and lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men have come here tonight from the children of Israel to search out the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'>And the woman took the two men and hid them; and she said, Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'>And it happened as the gate was being shut, when it was dark, that the men departed. Where the men have gone I do not know; pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'>(But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'>And the men pursued them by the road to the Jordan, to the fords. And as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'>And before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.9'>and said to the men: I know that Jehovah has given you the land, that the terror of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'>For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'>And as soon as we heard these things, our hearts melted; neither did there remain any more courage in anyone because of you, for Jehovah your God, He is God in the heavens above and on earth beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'>Now therefore, I beg you, swear to me by Jehovah, since I have shown you kindness, that you also will show kindness to my fathers house, and give me a true token,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'>and save alive my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our souls from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'>And the men answered her, Our lives for yours, if you tell none of this business of ours. And it shall be, when Jehovah gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'>Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the side of the wall; she dwelt in the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'>And she said to them, Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you. Hide there three days, until the pursuers return; and afterward you may go your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'>And the men said to her: We will be exempt from this oath of yours which you have made us swear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'>unless, when we come into the land, you bind this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you have let us down; and you shall bring your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your fathers household into your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'>And it shall be that whoever goes outside the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his own head, and we will be guiltless. And whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head if a hand is laid on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'>And if you tell this business of ours, then we will be free from your oath which you have made us swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'>And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet cord in the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'>They departed and went into the mountain, and stayed there three days until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers sought them all along the way, but did not find them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'>So the two men returned, descended from the mountain, and crossed over; and they came to Joshua the son of Nun, and recounted to him all that happened to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'>And they said to Joshua, Truly Jehovah has delivered all the land into our hands, for indeed all the inhabitants of the land have melted before us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'>And Joshua arose early in the morning; and they set out from Shittim and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before crossing over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'>So it was, after three days, that the officers went through the camp;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'>and they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests, the Levites, bearing it, then you shall set out from your place and go after it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'>Yet there shall be a distance between you and it of about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go, for you have not passed this way before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'>And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonders among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'>And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over before the people. So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'>And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day I will begin to magnify you in the eyes of all Israel, and they shall know that, as I was with Moses, so I am with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'>And you shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you have come to the edge of the water of the Jordan, you shall remain standing in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'>And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of Jehovah your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'>And Joshua said, By this you shall know that the living Mighty God is among you, and that He will destroy to dispossess before you the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Jebusites:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over before you into the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'>Now therefore, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'>And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, the waters that come down from upstream, and they shall stand in a heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'>So it was, when the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'>and as those who bore the ark came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped into the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks during the whole time of harvest),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'>that the waters which came down from upstream stood still, and rose in a heap very far away at Adam, the city that is beside Zaretan. Thus the waters that went down into the sea of the plain, the Salt Sea, stopped, and were cut off; and the people crossed over opposite Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'>And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until all the people had crossed completely over the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'>And it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over the Jordan, that Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'>Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'>and command them, saying, Take for yourselves twelve stones from here, out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the priests feet stood firm. You shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you lodge tonight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'>Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the children of Israel, one man from each tribe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'>and Joshua said to them: Cross over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and each one of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'>that this may be a sign among you when your children ask in time to come, saying, What are these stones to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'>Then you shall answer them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel for all time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'>And the children of Israel did so, as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'>And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, at the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'>Thus, the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that Jehovah had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and crossed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'>And it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over, that the ark of Jehovah and the priests crossed over before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'>And the men of Reuben, the men of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'>About forty thousand prepared for war crossed over before Jehovah for battle, to the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'>On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the eyes of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.15'>And Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.16'>Command the priests who bear the ark of the Testimony to come up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.17'>Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.18'>And it came to pass, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah had come from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests feet touched the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.19'>Now the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.20'>And the twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.21'>And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying: When your sons ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What are these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.22'>then you shall let your children know, saying, Israel crossed over this Jordan on dry land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.23'>for Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.24'>that all the peoples of the earth might know the hand of Jehovah, that it is mighty, that you may fear Jehovah your God all your days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'>So it was, when all the kings of the Amorites who were on the west side of the Jordan, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the children of Israel until we had crossed over, that their heart melted; and there was no spirit in them any longer because of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'>At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make flint knives for yourself, and circumcise the sons of Israel again the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.3'>And Joshua made flint knives for himself, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.4'>And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: All the people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way, after they had come out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.5'>For all the people who came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness, on the way as they came out of Egypt, had not been circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.6'>For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people who were men of war, who had come out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not obey the voice of Jehovah; to whom Jehovah swore that He would not show them the land which Jehovah had sworn to their fathers that He would give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.7'>And Joshua circumcised their sons whom He raised up in their place; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.8'>So it was, when they had finished circumcising all the people, that they stayed in their places in the camp to be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.9'>And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you. Therefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.10'>And the children of Israel camped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening on the wilderness plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.11'>And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the Passover, unleavened bread and roasted grain, on the very same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.12'>And the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten the produce of the land; and the children of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.13'>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, Are You for us or for our adversaries?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.14'>And He said, No, but as Commander of the army of Jehovah I have now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and prostrated himself, and said to Him, What does my Lord speak to His servant?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.15'>And the Commander of the army of Jehovah said to Joshua, Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you are standing is holy. And Joshua did so.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.1'>Now Jericho was closed, shut up before the children of Israel; no one going out, and no one coming in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.2'>And Jehovah said to Joshua: Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand, its king, and the mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.3'>You shall go around the city, all the men of war; you shall go all around the city once. Thus you shall do six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.4'>And seven priests shall bear seven shofars of rams horns before the ark. And the seventh day you shall go around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the shofars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.5'>And it shall come to pass, when they make a long blast with the rams horn, and when you hear the sound of the shofar, that all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat. And the people shall go up every man straight before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.6'>And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven shofars of rams horns before the ark of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.7'>And he said to the people, Pass along, and go around the city, and let him who is armed go along before the ark of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.8'>So it was, when Joshua spoke to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven shofars of rams horns before Jehovah went along and blew the shofars, with the ark of the covenant of Jehovah following behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.9'>The armed men went before the priests who blew the shofars, with the rear guard coming along behind the ark, while they proceeded blowing the shofars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.10'>And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, You shall not shout or cause your voice to be heard, nor shall a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, Shout! Then you shall shout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.11'>So the ark of Jehovah went around the city, going around it once. And they came into the camp and lodged in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.12'>And Joshua arose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.13'>And seven priests bearing seven shofars of rams horns before the ark of Jehovah proceeded to walk and blew with the shofars. And the armed men went before them, the rear guard coming behind the ark of Jehovah, while they proceeded blowing the shofars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.14'>And the second day they went around the city once and returned to the camp. Thus they did six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.15'>But it came to pass on the seventh day that they arose early, about the dawning of the day, and went around the city seven times in the same manner. Only, on that day they went around the city seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.16'>And the seventh time it happened, when the priests had blown the shofars, that Joshua said to the people: Shout! For Jehovah has given you the city!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.17'>And the city shall be devoted unto Jehovah, it and all who are in it. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we had sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.18'>And you shall altogether keep from the devoted things, that you not be accursed when you take of the devoted things, and make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.19'>And all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are holy unto Jehovah; they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.20'>So the people shouted when the priests blew the shofars. And it happened, when the people heard the sound of the shofars and the people shouting with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat. And the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.21'>And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.22'>And Joshua had said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the harlots house, and from there bring out the woman and all that she has, as you have sworn to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.23'>And the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. And they brought out all her family and set them outside the camp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.24'>And they burned the city and all that was in it with fire. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.25'>And Joshua saved alive Rahab the harlot, her fathers house, and all that she had. And she dwells in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.26'>And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah who rises up and builds this city Jericho; he shall lay its foundation with his firstborn, and with his youngest he shall set up its gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.27'>Thus Jehovah was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout all the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.1'>But the children of Israel committed a trespass regarding the devoted things, for Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted things; so the anger of Jehovah burned against the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.2'>Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is next to Beth Aven, to the east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.3'>And they returned to Joshua and said to him, Do not let all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Do not make all the people toil there, for they are few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.4'>So about three thousand men went up there from the people, but they fled before the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.5'>And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six men, for they chased them from before the gate as far as Shebarim, and struck them down on the descent. And the hearts of the people melted and became like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.6'>And Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Jehovah until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they threw dust on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.7'>And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all; to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Oh, that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.8'>O Lord, what shall I say when Israel turns its back before its enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.9'>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear it, and surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.10'>And Jehovah said to Joshua: Get up! Why do you lie thus on your face?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.11'>Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I have commanded them. For they have even taken some of the devoted things, and have both stolen and deceived; and they have also put it among their own stuff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.12'>Therefore the sons of Israel were not able to stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they are accursed. Neither will I be with you anymore, unless you destroy the accursed from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.13'>Get up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, because thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: There is a devoted thing in your midst, O Israel; you are not able to stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted thing from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.14'>In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which Jehovah takes shall come according to families; and the family which Jehovah takes shall come by households; and the household which Jehovah takes shall come man by man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.15'>And it shall be that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.16'>So Joshua arose early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.17'>He brought near the family of Judah, and he took the family of the Zarhites; and he brought near the family of the Zarhites man by man, and Zabdi was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.18'>And he brought near his house man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.19'>And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give glory to Jehovah the God of Israel, and make confession to Him, and please tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.20'>And Achan answered Joshua and said, Indeed I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel, and this is what I have done:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.21'>When I saw among the spoils a beautiful garment from Shinar, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. And behold, they are hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, with the silver under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.22'>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.23'>And they took them from the midst of the tent, brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.24'>And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the garment, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had, and they brought them to the valley of Achor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.25'>And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? Jehovah shall trouble you this day! And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.26'>And they raised over him a great heap of stones, still there to this day. And Jehovah turned back from His burning anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Achor to this day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.8'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.1'>And Jehovah said to Joshua: Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai. Behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.2'>And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king. Only its spoils and its cattle you shall take as plunder for yourselves. Lay an ambush for the city behind it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.3'>So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai; and Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor and sent them away by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.4'>And he commanded them, saying: Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.5'>And I and all the people with me shall approach the city; and it shall come about, when they come out against us as at the first, that we shall flee before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.6'>For they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city, for they will think, They are fleeing before us as at the first. Therefore we will flee before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.7'>Then you shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city, for Jehovah your God has delivered it into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.8'>And it shall be, when you have taken the city, that you shall set the city on fire. According to the word of Jehovah you shall do. See, I have commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.9'>Joshua therefore sent them out; and they went to lie in ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; and Joshua lodged that night among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.10'>And Joshua rose up early in the morning and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.11'>And all the people of war who were with him went up and drew near; and they came before the city and camped on the north side of Ai. Now a valley lay between them and Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.12'>So he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.13'>And when they had set the people, all the army that was on the north of the city, and its rear guard on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.14'>And it happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hurried and arose early and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at an appointed place before the plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.15'>And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by way of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.16'>So all the people of Ai were assembled to pursue them. And they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.17'>There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel. So they left the city open and pursued Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.18'>And Jehovah said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin in his hand toward the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.19'>And those in ambush rose up quickly out of their place; they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and they entered the city and took it, and hurried to set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.20'>And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended to the heavens. So they had no strength to flee this way or that way, and the people who had fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.21'>And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.22'>And the others came out of the city against them; so they were caught in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side. And they struck them down, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.23'>And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.24'>And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness where they pursued them, and when they all had fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.25'>And all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand; all the people of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.26'>For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.27'>Only the livestock and the spoils of that city Israel took as plunder for themselves, according to the word of Jehovah which He had commanded Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.28'>And Joshua burned Ai and made it a perpetual heap, a desolation to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.29'>And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening. And as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded and they took his corpse down from the tree, cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raise over it a great heap of stones that remains to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.30'>And Joshua built an altar unto Jehovah the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.31'>as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: an altar of whole stones on which no man has wielded an iron tool. And they offered upon it burnt offerings unto Jehovah, and sacrificed peace offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.32'>And there, in the presence of the children of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the Law of Moses, which he had written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.33'>And all Israel, with their elders and officers and judges, stood on either side of the ark before the priests, the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, the sojourner as well as he who was born among them. Half of them were in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.34'>And afterward he read all the Words of the Law, the blessings and the curses, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.35'>There was not a Word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the sojourners who were living among them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.9'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.1'>And it came to pass when all the kings who were by the Jordan, in the hills and in the lowland and in all the coasts of the Great Sea toward Lebanon; the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; heard about it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.2'>that they gathered together to fight with Joshua and Israel with one mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.3'>But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.4'>they did shrewdly, and went and pretended to be ambassadors. And they took old sacks on their donkeys, old wineskins torn and bound up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.5'>old and patched sandals on their feet, and old garments on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry and in crumbs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.6'>And they went to Joshua, to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, We have come from a distant land; now therefore, make a treaty with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.7'>And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, Perhaps you are dwelling among us; so how can we make a treaty with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.8'>But they said to Joshua, We are your servants. And Joshua said to them, Who are you, and where do you come from?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.9'>So they said to him: Your servants have come from a very distant land, because of the name of Jehovah your God; for we have heard of His fame, and all that He has done in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.10'>and all that He has done to the two kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan; to Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.11'>Therefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our land spoke to us, saying, Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, We are your servants; now therefore, make a treaty with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.12'>This bread of ours we took hot for our provision from our houses on the day we departed to come to you. But now behold, it is dry and crumbly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.13'>And these wineskins which we filled were new, and behold, they are torn; and these our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.14'>And the men of Israel took some of their provisions; but they did not ask at the mouth of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.15'>And Joshua made peace with them, and made a treaty with them to let them live; and the leaders of the congregation swore to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.16'>And it happened at the end of three days, after they had made the treaty with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, dwelling among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.17'>And the children of Israel journeyed and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjath Jearim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.18'>But the sons of Israel did not strike them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by Jehovah the God of Israel. And all the congregation grumbled against the leaders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.19'>Then all the leaders said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by Jehovah the God of Israel; now therefore, we cannot touch them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.20'>This we will do to them: We will let them live, that wrath not be upon us because of the oath which we have sworn to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.21'>And the leaders said to them, Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the leaders have spoken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.22'>And Joshua summoned them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have you deceived us, saying, We are very far from you, when you are dwelling among us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.23'>Now therefore, you are cursed, and none of you shall fail to be slaves, woodcutters and drawers of water for the house of my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.24'>And they answered Joshua and said, Because it was reported and told to your servants that Jehovah your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you; therefore we were greatly afraid for our souls because of you, and have done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.25'>And now behold, we are in your hands; do with us as seems good and right in your eyes to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.26'>Thus he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the sons of Israel, so that they did not kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.27'>And that day Joshua made them woodcutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of Jehovah, in the place which He would choose, even to this day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.10'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.1'>Now it came to pass when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.2'>that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.3'>Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.4'>Come up to me and help me, that we may strike Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.5'>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they and all their armies, and camped before Gibeon and made war against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.6'>And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, Do not forsake your servants; come up to us quickly, save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the mountains have gathered together against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.7'>So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.8'>And Jehovah said to Joshua, Do not fear them, for I have delivered them into your hand; not a man of them shall stand before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.9'>Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly, having marched all night from Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.10'>And Jehovah routed them before Israel, struck them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, pursued them along the way that goes to Beth Horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.11'>And it happened, as they fled before Israel and were on the descent of Beth Horon, that Jehovah cast down large hailstones from the heavens upon them as far as Azekah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than the sons of Israel had killed with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.12'>Then Joshua spoke to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel, and he said in the eyes of Israel: Sun, stand still over Gibeon; and Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.13'>And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the people took vengeance upon their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of the heavens, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.14'>And there has been no day like that, before it or after it, that Jehovah heeded the voice of a man; for Jehovah fought for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.15'>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.16'>But these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave at Makkedah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.17'>And it was reported to Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found hidden in a cave at Makkedah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.18'>And Joshua said, Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.19'>And do not stay there yourselves, but pursue your enemies, and strike their rear guard. Do not allow them to enter their cities, for Jehovah your God has delivered them into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.20'>And it happened, while Joshua and the sons of Israel made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they had finished, that those who had escaped entered fortified cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.21'>And all the people returned to the camp, to Joshua at Makkedah, in peace. No one moved his tongue against any of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.22'>And Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.23'>And they did so, and brought out those five kings to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.24'>And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua summoned all the men of Israel, and said to the commanders of the men of war who had gone with him, Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings. And they drew near and put their feet on their necks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.25'>And Joshua said to them, Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage, for thus Jehovah will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.26'>And afterward Joshua struck them and killed them, and hung them on five trees; and they were hanging on the trees until evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.27'>And so at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, cast them into the cave where they had been hidden, and laid large stones against the caves mouth, which remain until this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.28'>On that day Joshua took Makkedah, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them; all the souls who were in it. He let none remain. He also did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.29'>And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah; and they fought against Libnah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.21.2'>And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, Jehovah has commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with their common lands for our cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.3'>And the sons of Israel gave to the Levites from their inheritance, at the mouth of Jehovah, these cities and their common lands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.4'>And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. And the sons of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Judah, from the tribe of Simeon, and from the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.5'>The rest of the sons of Kohath had ten cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim, from the tribe of Dan, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.6'>And the sons of Gershon had thirteen cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Issachar, from the tribe of Asher, from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.21.8'>And the sons of Israel gave these cities with their common lands by lot to the Levites, as Jehovah had commanded by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.9'>And they gave from the tribe of the sons of Judah and from the tribe of the sons of Simeon these cities which are designated by name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.10'>which were for the sons of Aaron, being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the sons of Levi; for theirs was the first lot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.11'>And they gave them Kirjath Arba (Arba was the father of Anak), which is Hebron, in the mountains of Judah, with the common land surrounding it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.12'>But the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.13'>Thus to the sons of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its common land (a city of refuge for the slayer), and Libnah with its common land,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.21.40'>So all the cities for the sons of Merari according to their families, the rest of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.41'>All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities with their common lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.42'>Every one of these cities had its common land surrounding it; thus were all these cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.43'>Thus Jehovah gave to Israel all the land of which He had sworn to give to their fathers, and they took possession of it and dwelt in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.44'>And Jehovah gave them rest all around, according to all that He had sworn to their fathers. And not a man of all their enemies stood against them; Jehovah delivered all their enemies into their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.45'>Not a word failed of any good thing which Jehovah had spoken to the house of Israel. All came to pass.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.22'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.1'>Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.2'>and said to them: You have kept all that Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I have commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.3'>You have not left your brethren these many days, to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of Jehovah your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.4'>And now Jehovah your God has given rest to your brethren, as He has promised them; now therefore, return and go to your tents and to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah has given you on the other side of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.5'>But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the Law which Moses the servant of Jehovah has charged you, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all His ways, to keep His commandments, to cleave unto Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.6'>So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.7'>Now to the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half of it Joshua gave a possession among their brethren on this side of the Jordan, westward. And when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.8'>and spoke to them, saying, Return with much riches to your tents, with very much livestock, with silver, with gold, with bronze, with iron, and with very much clothing. Divide the spoils of your enemies with your brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.9'>And the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they had obtained according to the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.10'>And when they came to the region of the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan; an altar of great appearance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.11'>And the children of Israel heard it said, Behold, the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar across from the land of Canaan, in the regions of the Jordan, at the border of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.12'>And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the sons of Israel gathered together at Shiloh to go to war against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.13'>Then the sons of Israel sent Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the sons of Reuben, to the sons of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.14'>and with him ten leaders, each one a chief leader of a fathers house of every tribe of Israel; and each one was the head of the house of his father among the thousands of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.15'>And they came to the sons of Reuben, to the sons of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.16'>Thus says the whole congregation of Jehovah: What treachery is this that you have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following Jehovah, in that you have built for yourselves an altar, that you might rebel this day against Jehovah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.17'>Was the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed to this day, and there was a plague in the congregation of Jehovah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.18'>but that you must turn away this day from following Jehovah? And it shall be, if you rebel today against Jehovah, that tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.19'>Nevertheless, if the land of your possession is unclean, then cross over to the land of the possession of Jehovah, where the tabernacle of Jehovah stands, and take possession among us; but do not rebel against Jehovah, nor rebel against us, by building yourselves an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.20'>Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And that man was not the only one to die in his iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.21'>Then the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered and said to the heads of the thousands of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.22'>Jehovah, the Mighty God of gods, Jehovah, the Mighty God of gods, He knows, and let Israel itself know; if it is in rebellion, or if in treachery against Jehovah, do not save us this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.23'>If we have built ourselves an altar to turn from following Jehovah, or if to offer on it burnt offerings or grain offerings, or if to offer peace offerings on it, let Jehovah Himself exact it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.24'>But we have done it in this manner out of concern, thinking, In time to come your sons may speak to our sons, saying, What have you to do with Jehovah the God of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.25'>For Jehovah has made the Jordan a border between you and us, you sons of Reuben and sons of Gad. You have no portion in Jehovah. Thus your sons would make our sons cease to fear Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.26'>Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.27'>but that it may be a witness between you and us and our generations after us, that we may perform the service of Jehovah before Him with our burnt offerings, with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your sons may not say to our sons in time to come, You have no portion in Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.28'>Therefore we thought that it shall be, when they say this to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Look at the pattern of the altar of Jehovah which our fathers have made, though not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between you and us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.29'>Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah, to turn from following Jehovah this day, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for grain offerings, or for sacrifices, besides the altar of Jehovah our God which is before His tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.30'>And when Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation, the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the sons of Manasseh had spoken, it pleased them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.31'>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the sons of Manasseh, This day we perceive that Jehovah is among us, because you have not committed this treachery against Jehovah. Now you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.32'>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the leaders, returned from the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought back word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.33'>And the thing was good in the eyes of the children of Israel, and the children of Israel blessed God and spoke no more of going against them in battle, to destroy the land where the sons of Reuben and Gad were living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.34'>And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar, Witness, For it is a witness between us that Jehovah is God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.23'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.1'>Now it came to pass, many days after Jehovah had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua had grown old and advanced in age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.2'>And Joshua summoned all Israel, their elders, their heads, their judges, and their officers, and said to them: I have become old and advanced in age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.3'>You have seen all that Jehovah your God has done to all these nations because of you, for Jehovah your God is He who was fighting for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.4'>Behold, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, as far as the Great Sea westward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.5'>And Jehovah your God will thrust them out before you and dispossess them before your faces. Thus you shall possess their land, as Jehovah your God has spoken to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.6'>Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, that you not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.7'>and that you not go among these nations, these remaining among you. You shall not make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause anyone to swear by them; you shall not serve them nor bow down to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.8'>but you shall cleave unto Jehovah your God, as you have done to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.9'>For Jehovah has driven out before you great and mighty nations; but as for you, no one has been able to stand before you to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.10'>One man of you shall chase a thousand, for Jehovah your God is He who is fighting for you, as He has spoken to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.11'>Therefore take diligent heed to your souls, to love Jehovah your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.12'>But if you turn back, to go away and cleave to the remnant of the nations; these that remain among you; and make marriages with them, and go in to them and they to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.13'>know and understand that Jehovah your God will no longer dispossess these nations before you. But they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land which Jehovah your God has given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.14'>Behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth. And you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing has failed of all the good things which Jehovah your God has spoken concerning you. All of them have come to pass for you; not one word of them has failed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.15'>Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all the good things have come upon you which Jehovah your God has spoken to you, so Jehovah will bring upon you every evil thing, to destroy you from this good land which Jehovah your God has given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.16'>When you have transgressed the covenant of Jehovah your God, which He has commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed down to them, then the anger of Jehovah will burn against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land which He has given to you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.24'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.1'>And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and summoned the elders of Israel, their heads, their judges, and their officers; and they presented themselves before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.2'>And Joshua said to all the people, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Your fathers (Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor) dwelt on the other side of the River in ancient times; and they served other gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.3'>And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the River, led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed and gave him Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.4'>To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave the mountains of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.5'>And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to what I have done among them. Afterward I have brought you out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.6'>And I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.7'>And they cried out unto Jehovah; and He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, brought the sea upon them, and covered them. And your eyes saw what I have done in Egypt. And you dwelt in the wilderness many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.8'>And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of the Jordan, and they fought with you. But I gave them into your hand, that you might possess their land, and I destroyed them before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.9'>Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose to make war against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.10'>But I was not willing to heed Balaam; therefore he continued to bless you. And I delivered you out of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.11'>And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the lords of Jericho fought against you; also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I delivered them into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.12'>I sent the hornet before you which drove them out before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword or with your bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.13'>I have given you a land for which you have not labored, and cities which you have not built, and you dwell in them; you are eating of the vineyards and olive groves which you have not planted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.14'>Now therefore, fear Jehovah, serve Him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers have served on the other side of the River and in Egypt. Serve Jehovah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.15'>And if it seems evil to you to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers have served that were on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.16'>And the people answered and said: Far be it from us to forsake Jehovah to serve other gods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.17'>for Jehovah our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, who has done those great signs before our eyes, and preserved us in all the way that we have gone and among all the people through whom we have passed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.18'>And Jehovah drove out before us all the people, including the Amorites who were living in the land. We also will serve Jehovah, for He is our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.19'>And Joshua said to the people, You cannot serve Jehovah, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous Mighty God; He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.20'>If you forsake Jehovah and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do evil and consume you, after He has done you good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.21'>And the people said to Joshua, No, but we will serve Jehovah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.22'>And Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Jehovah for yourselves, to serve Him. And they said, We are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.23'>Now therefore, he said, put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.24'>And the people said to Joshua, Jehovah our God we will serve, and His voice we will obey!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.25'>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and established for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.26'>And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. And he took a large stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.27'>And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us, for it has heard all the words of Jehovah which He has spoken to us. It shall therefore be a witness to you, lest you deny your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.28'>So Joshua sent the people away, each to his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.29'>And it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being one hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.30'>And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Serah, in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.31'>And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua, who had known all the works of Jehovah which He had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.32'>And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried at Shechem, in the plot of ground which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of silver, and which had become an inheritance of the sons of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.33'>And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill belonging to Phinehas his son, which had been given to him in the mountains of Ephraim.</verse>
