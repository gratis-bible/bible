  <div osisID='Gal' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>and all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you into the grace of Christ, to a different gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>which is not another; but there are some who trouble you, even determined to pervert the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>But even if we, or an angel from Heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but by a revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mothers womb and called me through His grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to inquire of Peter, and remained with him fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>But I saw none of the other apostles except Jacob, the Lords brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>(Now concerning the things which I write to you, indeed, before God, I do not lie.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>Afterward I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>But they were hearing only, He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which he once tried to destroy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>And they glorified God in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and also took Titus with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of reputation, lest by any means I might run, or had run, in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>Yet not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>And this occurred because of false brethren secretly brought in (who came in by stealth to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>to whom we did not yield in submission even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>But those who seemed to be something (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God shows personal regard to no man), those who seemed to be important added nothing to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel for the uncircumcised had been committed to me, as the gospel for the circumcised was to Peter</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>(for He who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised also worked effectively in me toward the Gentiles),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>and when Jacob, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that had been given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>They desired only that we should remember the poor, the very thing which I also was eager to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>for before certain men came from Jacob, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live in the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews, why do you compel Gentiles to Judaize?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through the faith of Jesus Christ, even we believe into Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the Law; for by the works of the Law no flesh shall be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also are found to be sinners, is Christ therefore a minister of sin? Let it not be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I confirm myself as a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For I through the Law died to the Law that I might live to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died in vain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O foolish Galatians. Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, do you now perfect yourselves in the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>Have you suffered so many things in vain; if indeed it was in vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and displays works of power in you, does He do it by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>Just as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>Therefore know that those who are of faith are sons of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel before to Abraham, saying, In you all the nations shall be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>So then those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>For as many as are of the works of the Law are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the Law, to do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>But that no one is justified by the Law in the sight of God is evident; for, The just shall live by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>Yet the Law is not of faith; but, The man who does them shall live in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though it is only a mans covenant, yet if it is confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, And to seeds, as of many, but as of one, And to your Seed, who is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>And this I say, A covenant having been established before by God in Christ, the Law coming into being four hundred and thirty years later, does not annul the promise, so as to abolish it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>For if the inheritance is of the Law, it is no longer of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>What purpose then does the Law serve? It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Is the Law then against the promises of God? Let it not be. For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been out of the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by the faith of Jesus Christ might be given to those believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the Law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>Therefore the Law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>For as many of you as were immersed into Christ have put on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>And if you are Christs, then you are Abrahams seed, and heirs according to the promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>Even so we, when we were children, were enslaved under the elements of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, brought forth out of a woman, brought forth under the Law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>to redeem those who were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, Abba, Father!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>However, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>But now, knowing God, or rather being known by God, how is it that you turn again to the feeble and worthless principles, to which you desire again to be in bondage?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>You observe days and months and seasons and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I am afraid for you, lest I have labored among you in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>Brethren, I beseech you to be as I am, for I am as you are. You have not wronged me at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>What then was the blessing you enjoyed? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>They zealously pursue you, but not well; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My little children, for whom I travail again until Christ is formed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, you who desire to be under the Law, do you not hear the Law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, and is in bondage with her children;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>but the Jerusalem from above is free, which is the mother of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>For it is written: Rejoice, O barren, you who do not bear. Break forth and shout, you who are not in labor. For the desolate has many more children than she who has a husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>Behold, I Paul say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>You have become cut off from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by Law; you have fallen from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness out of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>This persuasion does not come from Him who calls you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will have no other mind; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he may be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then the offense of the cross has ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>I could wish that those who unsettle your minds would even cut themselves off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you are not consumed by one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, sexual perversion, uncleanness, licentiousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>meekness, self-control. Against such there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>And those who are Christs have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.26'>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.6'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering yourself that you not also be tempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>Bear one anothers burdens, and so fulfill the Law of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>But let each one prove his own work, and then he alone will have rejoicing in himself, and not in another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>For each one shall bear his own load.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>Let him being taught the Word share in all good things with him who teaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Do not be led astray, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due time we shall reap if we do not faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>For not even those who are circumcised keep the Law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>But may it never be that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.15'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any power, but a new creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.16'>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.17'>From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brand marks of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.18'>Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
