      <chapter osisID='Col.1'>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.2'>to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are in Colosse: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>We give thanks to God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of your love for all the saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>because of the hope being laid up for you in Heaven, of which you heard before in the Word of the Truth of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>which has come to you, as in all the world, and is bearing fruit, as it is also among you, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>even as you also learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the full true knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, bearing fruit in every good work and growing into the full true knowledge of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>giving thanks to the Father who has made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>who has delivered us from the authority of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>in whom we have redemption through His blood, the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>For by Him all things were created that are in Heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. All things were created through Him and for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>And He is the Head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn out from the dead, that in all things He may be preeminent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.19'>For it is good that in Him all the fullness should dwell,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.20'>and by Him making peace through the blood of His cross, by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, whether things on earth or things in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.21'>And you, who once were alienated and hostile in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.22'>in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and without blemish, and above reproach in His sight;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>if indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard, which was preached to every creature under Heaven, of which I, Paul, was made a minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>I now rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ, on behalf of His body, which is the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>of which I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God which was given to me for you, to fulfill the Word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>To them God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles: which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>Him we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man complete in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>To this end I also labor, striving according to His working which works in me mightily.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>For I want you to know what a great struggle I have for you and those in Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, and attaining to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the full true knowledge of the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>Now this I say that no one should delude you with persuasive words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>being rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>Beware that no one rob you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the traditions of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>and you are made full in Him, who is the Head of all rule and authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>In Him you were also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>buried with Him in immersion, in which you also were raised with Him through the faith of the working of God, who raised Him out from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>And you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>having blotted out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>having disarmed rulers and authorities, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>Let no one condemn you, taking delight in false humility and worship of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, being puffed up without cause by his fleshly mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>and not holding fast to the Head; from whom all the body, nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments, grows with the increase that is from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>Therefore, if you died with Christ from the basic principles of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to decrees;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>which all concern things which perish with the using; according to the commandments and doctrines of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>These things indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self-devised worship, false humility, and severity in abuse of the body, but are of no value against gratification of the flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>If then you are raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>Set your mind on things above, not on the things of the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>for you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>When Christ who is our life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: sexual perversion, uncleanness, passion, evil lusts, and covetousness, which is idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>in which you yourselves once walked when you lived in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>But now you yourselves are to put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language out of your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his practices,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>and have put on the new man who is renewed in full true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all things and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.14'>And above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.16'>Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.17'>And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God, even the Father, through Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.18'>Wives, submit to your own husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.19'>Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter towards them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.20'>Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.21'>Fathers, do not provoke your children, that they may not become discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.22'>Bondservants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.23'>And whatever you do, do it from the soul, as to the Lord and not to men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.24'>knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.25'>But he who does wrong will be repaid for what he has done, and there is no partiality.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.4'>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.1'>Masters, give your bondservants what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.2'>Be devoted to prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.3'>meanwhile praying also for us, that God would open to us a door for the Word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.4'>that I may make it clearly understood, as I ought to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.5'>Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.6'>Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.7'>Tychicus, a beloved brother, faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord, will tell you everything about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.8'>I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and encourage your hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.9'>with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all things which are happening here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.10'>Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, with Mark the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions: if he comes to you, welcome him),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.11'>and Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are of the circumcision; they have been a comfort to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.12'>Epaphras, who is one of you, a bondservant of Christ, greets you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand complete and full-grown in all the will of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.13'>for I bear him witness that he has a great zeal for you, and those who are in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.14'>Luke the beloved physician, and Demas greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.15'>Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas and the church that is in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.16'>Now when this epistle is read among you, see that it is read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.17'>And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.18'>This salutation by my own hand: Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
