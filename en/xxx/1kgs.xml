  <div osisID='1Kgs' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>Now King David was old, advanced in years; and they covered him with clothes, for he could not get warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>Therefore his servants said to him, Let a young woman, a virgin, be sought for our lord the king, and let her stand before the king, and serve him; and let her lie in your bosom, that our lord the king may be warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>So they sought for a beautiful girl throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>The girl was very beautiful; and she served the king, and ministered to him; but the king did not know her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king; and he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>(Now his father had not hurt him at any time by saying, Why have you done so? He was also very good in appearance. And his mother had borne him after Absalom.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>And he spoke with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they went after Adonijah and helped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David were not with Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En Rogel; he also invited all his brothers, the kings sons, and all the men of Judah, the kings servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or Solomon his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>So Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>Come now, please let me counsel you with advice, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Depart and go to King David and say to him, Have you not sworn to your maidservant, my lord, O king, saying, Surely your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? Why then has Adonijah become king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>Then, while you are still speaking with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>So Bathsheba came into the chamber to the king. (Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>And Bathsheba bowed and did homage to the king. And the king said, What can I do for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>And she said to him, My lord, you have sworn by Jehovah your God to your maidservant, saying, Surely Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>So now, behold, Adonijah has become king; and now, my lord the king, you have not known about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>He has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army; but Solomon your servant he has not invited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>And as for you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, to tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king lies down with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted as offenders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>And behold, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>And they reported to the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he came in before the king, he bowed down to the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>For he has gone down today, and has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the kings sons, and the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and behold, they are eating and drinking before him; and they said, Long live King Adonijah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>But he has not invited me; me your servant, nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king, and you have not declared to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>Then King David answered and said, Summon Bathsheba to me. So she came before the king and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>And the king swore and said, As Jehovah lives, who has redeemed my life from every distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>just as I have sworn to you by Jehovah the God of Israel, saying, Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place, thus I shall do this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>And Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did homage to the king, and said, Let my lord King David live forever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>And King David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came in before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>There let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel; and blow the shofar, and say, Long live King Solomon!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>And when you have come up after him, he shall come and sit on my throne, and he shall be king in my place. For I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, Amen! Thus says Jehovah the God of my lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>As Jehovah has been with my lord the king, even so shall He be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King Davids mule, and brought him to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. And they blew the shofar, and all the people said, Long live King Solomon!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>And all the people went up after him; and the people played the flutes and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth was rent with their sound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>And Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had finished eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the shofar, he said, Why is the city in such a commotion?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>And while he was still speaking, behold Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest came in. And Adonijah said to him, Come in, for you are a mighty man, and bring good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, No rather, our lord King David has made Solomon king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have made him ride on the kings mule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon; and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is all stirred up. This is the sound that you have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>Also Solomon has sat down on the throne of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>And moreover the kings servants have gone to bless our lord King David, saying, May God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and may He make his throne greater than your throne. And the king bowed himself on the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>Also the king has said, Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, with my eyes seeing it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>So all the guests who were with Adonijah trembled, and rose up, and each one went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>And Adonijah was afraid of Solomon; so he arose, and went and took hold of the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>And it was reported to Solomon, saying, Behold Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon; for behold, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon swear to me this day that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>And Solomon said, If he is a son of worth, not one hair of him shall fall to the earth; but if evil is found in him, he shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and prostrated himself to King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, Go to your house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>And the days drew near for David to die, and he charged Solomon his son, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>I am going the way of all the earth; be strong, therefore, and be a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>And keep the charge of Jehovah your God: to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commandments, His judgments, and His testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>that Jehovah may establish His word which He has spoken concerning me, saying, If your sons take heed to their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, He said, there shall not fail to be a man on the throne of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner and Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed. And he shed the blood of war in peacetime, and put the blood of war on the belt around his waist, and on the sandals on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>Therefore do according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray hair go down to the grave in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those eating at your table, for they came to me when I fled before Absalom your brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>And behold, with you is Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who cursed me with grievous cursing in the day when I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by Jehovah, saying, I will not put you to death with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>Now therefore, do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man and know what you ought to do to him; but bring his gray hair down to the grave with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>So David rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>And Solomon sat on the throne of his father David; and his kingdom was firmly established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Do you come in peace? And he said, In peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>Moreover he said, I have something to say to you. And she said, Speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>And he said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had set their faces toward me, to reign. However, the kingdom has been turned around, and has become my brothers; for it was his from Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>Now I ask one petition of you; do not turn away my face. And she said to him, Speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>And he said, Please speak to King Solomon, for he will not turn away your face; that he would give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>And Bathsheba said, Very well, I will speak for you unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>Bathsheba therefore came to King Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her and bowed down to her, and sat down on his throne and had a throne set for the kings mother; and she sat at his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>And she said, I am asking one small petition of you; do not turn away my face. And the king said to her, Ask it, my mother, for I will not turn away your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>So she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>And King Solomon answered and said to his mother, Now why are you asking for Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he is my older brother; for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>And King Solomon swore by Jehovah, saying, May God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own soul!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>Now therefore, as Jehovah lives, who has confirmed me and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has established a house for me, as He has promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>So King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>And to Abiathar the priest the king said, Go to Anathoth, to your own fields, for you are a man deserving of death; but I will not put you to death this day, because you have carried the ark of the Lord Jehovah before my father David, and because you were afflicted in every thing in which my father was afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>Thus Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest unto Jehovah, to fulfill the word of Jehovah which He had spoken concerning the house of Eli at Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>And the news came to Joab, for Joab had turned aside after Adonijah, though he had not turned aside after Absalom. So Joab fled to the tent of Jehovah, and took hold of the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>And it was reported to King Solomon, Joab has fled to the tent of Jehovah, and behold, he is by the altar. So Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>So Benaiah went to the tent of Jehovah, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come out! And he said, No, but I will die here. And Benaiah brought back word to the king, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall upon him and bury him, that you may turn aside from me and from the house of my father the innocent blood which Joab has shed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>Thus Jehovah shall return his blood upon his own head, who has fallen upon two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, without the knowledge of my father David: Abner the son of Ner, the commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, the commander of the army of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his seed forever. But upon David and his seed, upon his house and his throne, there shall be peace forever from Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.34'>So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell upon him and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.35'>And the king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army, and the king appointed Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.36'>And the king sent and summoned Shimei, and said to him, Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and do not go out from there anywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.37'>For it shall be, on the day that you go out and have crossed over the Brook Kidron, consider to understand that you shall be executed to death; your blood shall be on your own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.38'>And Shimei said to the king, The word is good. As my lord the king has spoken, thus your servant will do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.39'>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two slaves of Shimei fled to Achish the son of Maachah, king of Gath. And they reported to Shimei, saying, Behold, your slaves are at Gath!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.40'>So Shimei rose up, saddled his donkey, and went to Achish at Gath to seek his slaves. And Shimei went and brought his slaves from Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.41'>And it was reported to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.42'>So the king sent and summoned Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make you swear by Jehovah, and warn you, saying, Consider to understand that on the day you go out and have gone anywhere, you shall be executed to death? And you said to me, The word I have heard is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.43'>Why then have you not kept the oath of Jehovah and the commandment that I have charged you with?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.44'>The king said moreover to Shimei, You know, as your heart acknowledges, all the evil that you did to my father David; therefore Jehovah shall return your evil upon your own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.45'>But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.46'>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out and fell upon him, and he died. Thus the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>And Solomon made himself son-in-law to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and married Pharaohs daughter; and he brought her into the City of David until he had finished building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall all around Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>The people were sacrificing at the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Jehovah until those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>And Solomon loved Jehovah, walking in the statutes of his father David, except that he was sacrificing and burning incense at the high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place: Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.5'>At Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask; what shall I give you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.6'>And Solomon said: You have shown great mercy to Your servant David my father, because he walked before You in truth, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with You; You have continued this great kindness for him, and You have given him a son sitting on his throne, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.7'>Now, O Jehovah my God, You have made Your servant king instead of my father David, but I am a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.8'>And Your servant is in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen, a people too numerous to be numbered or counted for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.9'>Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.10'>And the word was good in the eyes of Jehovah, that Solomon had asked this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.11'>And God said to him: Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked long life for yourself, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.16'>Now two women who were harlots came to the king, and stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.17'>And one woman said, O my lord, this woman and I are dwelling in the same house; and I gave birth while she was in the house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.22'>And the other woman said, No! But the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son. And the first woman said, No! But the dead one is your son, and the living one is my son. Thus they spoke before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.23'>And the king said, The one says, This is my son, who lives, and your son is the dead one; and the other says, No! But your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.24'>And the king said, Bring me a sword. So they brought a sword before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.25'>And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to one, and half to the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.26'>Then the woman whose son was living spoke to the king, for her womb yearned for her son; and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and do not put him to death! But the other said, Let him be neither mine nor yours, but divide him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.27'>So the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and do not put him to death; she is his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.28'>And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had rendered, and they feared his presence; for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to execute justice.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.5'>Against the wall of the house he built chambers all around, against the walls of the house, all around the temple and the inner sanctuary. Thus he made chambers all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.6'>The lowest chamber was five cubits wide, the middle was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for he made narrow ledges around the outside of the house, so that the support beams would not be fastened into the walls of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.7'>And the house, when it was being built, was built with stone finished at the quarry, so that no hammer or ax or any iron tool was heard in the house while it was being built.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.28'>He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.32'>The two doors were of olive wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he beat out the gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.33'>And for the door of the temple he also made doorposts of olive wood; one-fourth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.19'>The capitals which were on top of the pillars in the hall were made like lilies, four cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.20'>The capitals on the two pillars also had pomegranates above, by the belly which was next to the network; and there were two hundred such pomegranates in rows on the other capital all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.21'>And he set up the pillars by the porch of the temple; he set up the pillar on the right and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the left and called its name Boaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.22'>The tops of the pillars were made like lilies. Thus the work of the pillars was finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.23'>And he made the cast sea of ten cubits from brim to brim; it was round all around. Its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits made a circuit all the way around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.24'>Below its brim round about were gourds all around, ten to a cubit, all the way around the sea. The gourds were cast in two rows when it was cast.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.31'>And its opening within and above the capital was a cubit; and its opening was round like the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half. And also on its opening were carvings; and their borders were square, not round.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.32'>And the four wheels were under the borders. And the axles of the wheels were attached to the cart; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.35'>On the top of the cart was a round compass a half cubit in height. And on the top of the cart, its stays and its supports were of the same casting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.36'>On the plates of its stays and on its borders he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, wherever there was a clear space on each, with wreaths all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.37'>Thus he made the ten carts. All of them were of the same cast, one measure, and one shape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.38'>And he made ten basins of bronze; each basin could hold forty baths, and each basin was four cubits. On each of the ten carts was a basin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.39'>And he put five carts on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward toward the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.40'>Hiram made the basins, the shovels and the bowls. Thus Hiram finished doing all the work that he did for King Solomon for the house of Jehovah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.41'>the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on top of the two pillars; the two networks covering the two bowls of the capitals which were on top of the pillars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.42'>four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on top of the pillars);</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.43'>the ten carts, and ten basins on the carts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.44'>the one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.45'>the pots, the shovels, and the bowls. All these articles which Hiram made for King Solomon for the house of Jehovah were of burnished bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.46'>In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in the clay ground between Succoth and Zaretan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.47'>And Solomon did not weigh all the articles, because there were so very many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.48'>Thus Solomon had all the articles made for the house of Jehovah: the altar of gold, and the table of gold on which was the Bread of the Presence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.49'>the lampstands of pure gold, five on the right side and five on the left in front of the inner sanctuary, with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.50'>the basins, the snuffers, the bowls, the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house (the Holy of Holies) and for the doors of the house of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.51'>Thus all the work that King Solomon had done for the house of Jehovah was finished; and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had consecrated: the silver and the gold and the articles, and He put them in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.8'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.1'>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel, unto King Solomon at Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the City of David, which is Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.2'>Therefore all the men of Israel assembled unto King Solomon at the feast in the month of Ethanim, which is the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.3'>So all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.4'>And they brought up the ark of Jehovah, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent. The priests and the Levites brought them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.5'>And King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.6'>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the Holy of Holies, under the wings of the cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.7'>For the cherubim spread their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered over the ark and its poles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.8'>The poles extended so that the ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place, in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.9'>Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses had put there at Horeb, when Jehovah had made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.10'>And it came to pass, when the priests came out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.12'>Then Solomon spoke: Jehovah has said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.13'>I have built to establish for You an exalted house, a fixed place for You to abide continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.14'>And the king turned his face around and blessed the whole assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.15'>And he said: Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, who has spoke with His mouth to my father David, and with His hand has fulfilled it, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.16'>Since the day that I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house, for My name to be there; but I chose David to be over My people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.17'>Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.18'>But Jehovah said to my father David, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well that it was in your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.19'>Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall come from your body, he shall build the house for My name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.20'>Thus Jehovah has fulfilled His word which He has spoken; and I have risen up in place of my father David, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah has promised; and I have built a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.21'>And there I have fixed a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of Jehovah which He had made with our fathers, when He brought them out from the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.22'>Then Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in front of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.23'>and he said: Jehovah the God of Israel, there is no god in the heavens above or on the earth below like You, who keeps Your covenant and mercy with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.24'>You have kept what You have promised Your servant David my father; You have both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.64'>And for that day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of Jehovah; for there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Jehovah was too small to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.65'>And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven more days; fourteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.66'>On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the good that Jehovah had done for His servant David, and for Israel His people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.24'>And all the earth was seeking the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.25'>Each man was bringing his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, armor, spices, horses, and mules, at a set rate year by year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.26'>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.27'>The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.28'>Also Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Mikveh; the kings merchants got them at Mikveh for a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.29'>Now a chariot that came up out from Egypt was six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse one hundred and fifty; and thus, by their hand, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.1'>But King Solomon loved many foreign women, as well as the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.3'>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives thrust away his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.4'>For so it was, when Solomon was old, that his wives thrust his heart aside after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as was the heart of his father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.5'>For Solomon departed after Ashtaroth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.6'>Solomon did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and did not fully follow after Jehovah, like his father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.7'>And Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.5'>So he said to them, Go away for three days, then come back to me. And the people departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.6'>And King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived, and he said, How do you counsel me to answer these people?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.8'>But he rejected the counsel which the elders had given him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him, who were standing before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.9'>And he said to them, What counsel do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, Lighten the yoke which your father has put on us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.10'>And the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus you shall speak to this people who have spoken to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter on us; thus you shall say to them: My little finger has become fatter than my fathers loins!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.11'>And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.12'>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, Come back to me the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.13'>And the king answered the people harshly, and rejected the counsel which the elders had given him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.14'>and he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.15'>Thus the king did not give heed to the people; for the turn of events was from Jehovah, to establish His word, which Jehovah had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.31'>He made houses on the high places, and made priests from among all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.32'>And Jeroboam instituted a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the feast that was in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar.

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.33'>Thus he offered up on the altar which he had made at Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month which he had contrived in his own heart.

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.1'>And behold, a man of God went from Judah to Bethel by the Word of Jehovah, and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.2'>And he cried out against the altar by the Word of Jehovah, and said, O altar, altar! Thus says Jehovah: Behold, a son, Josiah by name, shall be born to the house of David; and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and mens bones shall be burned on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.3'>And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign that Jehovah has spoken this: Behold, the altar shall split apart, and the ashes on it shall be poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.4'>So it came to pass when King Jeroboam heard the utterance of the man of God, who cried out against the altar in Bethel, that he stretched forth his hand from the altar, saying, Arrest him! And his hand, which he had stretched forth toward him, withered, so that he could not pull it back to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.5'>The altar also was split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the Word of Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.27'>And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle the donkey for me. So they saddled it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.28'>And he went and found his corpse thrown on the road, and the donkey and the lion standing by the corpse. The lion had not eaten the corpse nor torn the donkey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.29'>And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. So the old prophet came to the city to mourn, and to bury him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.14'>And now you say, Go, tell your master, Behold Elijah is here. He will kill me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.15'>And Elijah said, As Jehovah of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely present myself to him today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.16'>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and reported to him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.17'>And it happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Is that you, O troubler of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.18'>And he answered, I have not troubled Israel, but you and your fathers house have, in that you have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah and have gone after the Baals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.19'>Now therefore, send and gather all Israel to me on Mount Carmel, the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of the groves, who eat at Jezebels table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.20'>So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.21'>And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long will you be limping between two divided opinions? If Jehovah is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow after him. But the people answered him not a word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.22'>Then Elijah said to the people, I alone am left a prophet of Jehovah; but Baals prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.23'>Therefore let them give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it; and I will prepare the other bull, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.24'>Then you call on the name of your gods, and I will call upon the name of Jehovah; and the god who answers by fire, He is God. So all the people answered and said, The word is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.25'>And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first, for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.26'>So they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even till noon, saying, O Baal, hear us! But there was no voice; no one answered. Then they leaped about the altar which they had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.27'>And so it was, at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is meditating, or he is busy, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.28'>So they cried aloud, and cut themselves, as was their custom, with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.29'>And when midday was past, they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice. But there was no voice; no one answered, no one paid attention.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.30'>Then Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah that was broken down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.31'>And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the Word of Jehovah had come, saying, Israel shall be your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.32'>And with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah; and he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.33'>And he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood, and said, Fill four waterpots with water, and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.34'>Then he said, Do it a second time, and they did it a second time; and he said, Do it a third time, and they did it a third time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.35'>And the water ran all around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.36'>And it came to pass, at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your Word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.37'>Testify, O Jehovah, testify, that this people may know that You are Jehovah God, and that You have turned their hearts around back to You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.38'>Then the fire of Jehovah fell and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.39'>And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, Jehovah, He is God! Jehovah, He is God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.40'>And Elijah said to them, Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let one of them escape! So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon and slaughtered them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.41'>And Elijah said to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.42'>So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.43'>and said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. So he went up and looked, and said, There is nothing. And seven times he said, Go back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.44'>And it came to pass the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there is a cloud, as small as a mans hand, rising out of the sea! So he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Prepare your chariot, and go down before the rain stops you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.45'>And it happened in the meantime that the sky became black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain. So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.46'>And the hand of Jehovah came upon Elijah; and he girded up his loins and ran ahead of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.3'>And when he saw that, he arose and ran for his life, and came to Beer-sheba of Judah, and left his servant there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.4'>But he himself went a days journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he requested for his soul that he might die, and said, It is enough! Now, Jehovah, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.5'>And as he lay and slept under a broom tree, behold an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.9'>And there he came into a cave, and spent the night there; and behold, the Word of Jehovah came to him, and He said to him, What are you doing here, Elijah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.10'>And he said, I have been very zealous for Jehovah the God of Hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek my soul, to take it away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.12'>and after the earthquake a fire, but Jehovah was not in the fire; and after the fire a whisper of a small voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.13'>And so it was, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave; and behold, a voice came to him, and said, What are you doing here, Elijah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.14'>And he said, I have been very zealous for Jehovah the God of Hosts; because the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek my soul, to take it away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.1'>Now Ben-Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his forces together; thirty-two kings were with him, with horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Samaria, and made war against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.2'>And he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, and said to him, Thus says Ben-Hadad:</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.4'>And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, just as you say, I and all that I have are yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.5'>And the messengers came back and said, Thus says Ben-Hadad, saying, Indeed I have sent to you, saying, You shall deliver to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.6'>but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants. And it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they shall put it in their hands and take it away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.7'>So the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Notice, please, and see how this man seeks evil, for he sent to me for my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold; and I have not withheld from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.8'>And all the elders and all the people said to him, Do not listen or consent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.9'>Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that you sent for to your servant the first time I will do, but this thing I cannot do. And the messengers departed and brought back word to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.10'>And Ben-Hadad sent to him and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if enough dust is left of Samaria for a handful for each of the people who follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.11'>And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not the one who puts on his armor boast like the one who takes it off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.12'>And it happened when Ben-Hadad heard this message, as he and the kings were drinking at the booths, that he said to his servants, Get ready. And they stationed themselves against the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.13'>And behold, a certain prophet approached Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus says Jehovah: Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I am delivering it into your hand today, and you shall know that I am Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.14'>So Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus says Jehovah: By the young rulers of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? And he answered, You.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.20'>And each one struck his man; so the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.21'>And the king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots, and struck the Syrians with a great slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.22'>And the prophet came to the king of Israel and said to him, Go, strengthen yourself; take note, and see what you should do, for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.23'>And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their gods are gods of the hills. Therefore they were stronger than us; but if we fight against them in the plain, will we not be stronger than them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.24'>So do this thing: Remove the kings, each from his place, and put governors in their places;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.25'>and you shall muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot. Then we shall fight against them in the plain; surely we will be stronger than them. And he heeded their voice and did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.26'>So it was, at the turn of the year, that Ben-Hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.27'>And the sons of Israel were mustered and given provisions, and they went against them. Now the sons of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, while the Syrians filled the land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.29'>And they encamped opposite each other for seven days. So it was that on the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand foot soldiers of the Syrians in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.30'>And the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; where a wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the men who were left. And Ben-Hadad fled and came into the city, into an inner chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.31'>And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings.

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.32'>So they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes around their heads, and came to the king of Israel and said, Your servant Ben-Hadad says, Please preserve my soul alive. And he said, Is he still alive? He is my brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.33'>Now the men observed carefully, and they quickly grasped at this word and said, Your brother Ben-Hadad. And he said, Go, bring him. Then Ben-Hadad came out to him; and he had him come up into the chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.34'>And Ben-Hadad said to him, The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.24'>The dogs shall eat whoever of Ahab dies in the city, and the birds of the heavens shall eat whoever dies in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.25'>Surely there had not been one like Ahab who had sold himself to do wickedness in the eyes of Jehovah, which his wife Jezebel had instigated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.26'>And he did exceedingly abominably to follow after the idols, according to all that the Amorites had done, whom Jehovah had cast out before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.27'>So it was, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted and lay in sackcloth, and walked about softly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.28'>And the Word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.29'>Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself before Me, I will not bring about the evil in his days; but in the days of his son I will bring about the evil upon his house.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.22'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.1'>Now three years passed without war between Syria and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.2'>And it came to pass, in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went down to visit the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.3'>And the king of Israel said to his servants, Have you known that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, but we are being inactive to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.4'>And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to fight at Ramoth Gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.5'>Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire at the Word of Jehovah today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.6'>So the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to fight, or shall I refrain? And they said, Go up, for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.7'>And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not still a prophet of Jehovah here, that we may inquire of Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.8'>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, because he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.9'>Then the king of Israel summoned a certain official and said, Bring Micaiah the son of Imlah quickly!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.10'>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, having put on their robes, sat each on his throne, at a vacant spot at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.11'>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made horns of iron for himself; and he said, Thus says Jehovah: With these you shall thrust at the Syrians to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.12'>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for Jehovah will deliver it into the kings hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.13'>And the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets with one mouth are agreeable to the king. Please, let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak pleasant things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.14'>And Micaiah said, As Jehovah lives, whatever Jehovah says to me, that I will speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.15'>So he came to the king; and the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall we refrain? And he answered him, Go and prosper, for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.16'>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you to speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.17'>Then he said, I have seen all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep having no shepherd. And Jehovah said, These have no master. Let each return to his house in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.18'>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.19'>And Micaiah said, Therefore hear the Word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on His throne, and all the host of Heaven standing by, on His right hand and on His left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.20'>And Jehovah said, Who will persuade Ahab to go up, that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead? So one said this, and another was saying that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.21'>Then a spirit came forward and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.22'>And Jehovah said to him, In what way? And he said, I will go out and be a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets. And Jehovah said, You shall entice him, and also prevail. Go out and do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.23'>Therefore now behold, Jehovah has put a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all these prophets of yours, and Jehovah has spoken calamity against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.24'>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way did the spirit from Jehovah go from me to speak to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.25'>And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.26'>So the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the kings son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.27'>and say, Thus says the king: Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction, until I come in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.28'>And Micaiah said, If you return to come back in peace, Jehovah has not spoken by me. And he said, All you people, pay attention!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.29'>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.30'>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself and go into battle; but you put on your robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.31'>Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two commanders of his chariots, saying, Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.32'>And so it was, when the commanders of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel! Therefore they turned aside to fight against him, and Jehoshaphat cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.33'>And it happened, when the commanders of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.34'>Now a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand and take me out of the battle, for I am wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.35'>And the battle increased that day; and the king was propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians, and died at evening. And the blood ran out from the wound onto the floor of the chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.36'>And as the sun was going down, a shout went throughout the camp, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own land!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.37'>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria. And they buried the king in Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.38'>And someone washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.39'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, the ivory house which he built and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.40'>So Ahab rested with his fathers. And Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.41'>Jehoshaphat the son of Asa had become king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.42'>Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.43'>And he walked in all the ways of his father Asa. He did not turn aside from them, doing what was right in the eyes of Jehovah. Nevertheless the high places were not taken away, for the people offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.44'>Also Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.45'>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the might that he showed, and how he made war, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.46'>And the rest of the male temple prostitutes, who had remained in the days of his father Asa, he removed out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.47'>There was then no king in Edom, only a deputy of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.48'>Jehoshaphat had made merchant ships to go to Ophir for gold; but they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at Ezion Geber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.49'>Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.50'>And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. And Jehoram his son reigned in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.51'>Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.52'>And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of his father and in the ways of his mother and in the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.53'>for he served Baal and bowed down to him, and provoked Jehovah the God of Israel to anger, according to all that his father had done.</verse>
