  <div osisID='Phil' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and ministers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>always in every prayer of mine making request for you all with joy</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it unto the day of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>just as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers with me of the grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For God is my witness, how greatly I long for you all with the affections of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in full true knowledge and all discernment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>that you may examine the things that differ, that you may be sincere and without blame unto the day of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>being filled with the fruits of righteousness through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>But I want you to know, brethren, that the things which happened to me have actually turned out for the furtherance of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>so that it has become evident to the whole palace guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>and most of the brethren in the Lord, having become confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the Word without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from good will:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>but the others out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>But if I live on in the flesh, this will mean fruit from my labor; yet what I shall choose I do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>For I am hard pressed between the two, having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>Nevertheless to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>And being persuaded of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>that your rejoicing for me may be more abundant in Jesus Christ by my coming to you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Only, let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>and not in any way terrified by your adversaries, which is to them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>having the same conflict which you saw in me and now hear is in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>Therefore if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or self-glory, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others as surpassing himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>Let each of you not look out for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>who, being in the form of God, did not consider clinging, to be equal with God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>And being found comprised as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him a name which is above every name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in Heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, cultivate your salvation with fear and trembling;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>Do all things without murmuring and disputing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>that you may be blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>holding fast the Word of Life, so that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain or labored in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>Yes, and if I am being poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>For the same cause you also be glad and rejoice with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged when I know your state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I have no one like-minded, who will sincerely care for your state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For all seek their own, not the things which are of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But you know his proven character, that as a son with his father he served with me in the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it goes with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>But I trust in the Lord that I myself shall also come shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>Yet I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, and your messenger and the one who ministered to my need;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>since he was longing for you all, and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>For indeed he was sick almost unto death; but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, that I should not have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>Therefore I send him the more eagerly, that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less sorrowful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such men in honor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because for the work of Christ he came close to death, not regarding his life, to supply what was lacking in your service toward me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. For me to write the same things to you is not tedious, but for you it is safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For we are the circumcision, who serve God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>though I also might have confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he may have confidence in the flesh, I more so:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; according to the Law, a Pharisee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the Law, blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss because of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>But no, rather, I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as refuse, that I may gain Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold, since Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brethren, I do not count myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and stretching forward to those things which are ahead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Therefore let us, as many as are complete, be of this mind; and if in anything you think differently, God will reveal even this to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>Nevertheless, to the degree that we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us be of the same mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Brethren, join in being imitators of me, and note those who so walk, as you have us for a pattern.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>For many conduct themselves, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and who glory in their shame; who set their mind on earthly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>For our citizenship is in Heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>Therefore, my beloved and longed-for brethren, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I implore Euodia and I implore Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>And I urge you also, true yoke-fellow, help these women who labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I say, rejoice!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let your fairness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy; think on these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me, do these, and the God of peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last your care for me has flourished again, though you surely did care, but you lacked opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in everything I am taught both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to lack.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I have strength for all things in Christ who strengthens me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>Nevertheless you have done well that you shared in my distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>Now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me concerning giving and receiving but you only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>For even in Thessalonica you sent aid once and again for my necessities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that abounds to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>Indeed I have all and abound. I am full, having received from Epaphroditus the things sent from you, a sweet-smelling aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>And my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>Now to our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the saints greet you, but especially those who are of Caesars household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</verse>
