      <chapter osisID='2Chr.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.1'>And Solomon the son of David strengthened himself in his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him and highly magnified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.2'>And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel, the heads of the fathers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.3'>and Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness, was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.4'>But David had brought up the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim to the place David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.5'>And the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of Jehovah; and Solomon and the assembly sought it out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.6'>And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Jehovah, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.7'>That night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.8'>And Solomon said to God: You have shown great mercy to David my father, and have made me king in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.9'>Now, O Jehovah God, let Your promise to David my father be established, for You have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.10'>Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of Yours?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.11'>And God said to Solomon: Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches or wealth or honor or the life of your enemies, nor have you asked long life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge My people over whom I have made you king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.12'>wisdom and knowledge are granted to you; and I will give you riches and wealth and honor, such as none of the kings who were before you have had, nor shall any after you have the like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.13'>So Solomon came to Jerusalem from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, and reigned over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.14'>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.15'>Also the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.16'>And Solomon had horses exported out of Egypt and Mikveh; the kings merchants got them at Mikveh for a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.17'>Now a chariot that came up and was brought out from Egypt was six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse one hundred and fifty; and thus, by their hand, they brought them out to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.1'>And Solomon determined to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a royal house for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.2'>Solomon numbered seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand to quarry stone in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.3'>And Solomon sent to Huram king of Tyre, saying: As you have dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build himself a house to dwell in,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.4'>behold, I am building a house for the name of Jehovah my God, to consecrate it to Him, to burn before Him spiced incense, for the continual Bread in Rows, for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God, continually in Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.5'>and the house which I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all gods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.6'>but who is able to build Him a house, since the heavens and the Heaven of heavens cannot contain Him? Who am I then, that I should build Him a house, except to burn sacrifices with smoke before Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.7'>Therefore now, send me a skilled man to work in gold and silver, in bronze and iron, in purple and crimson and violet, who has skill to engrave carvings with the wise men who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father has provided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.8'>Also send me cedar, cypress and algum from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon; and behold my servants will be with your servants,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.9'>to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the house which I am building shall be great and wonderful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.10'>And behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who are cutting timber, twenty thousand kors of ground wheat, twenty thousand kors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.11'>And Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon: Because of Jehovahs love for His people, He has appointed you king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.12'>Huram also said: Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, who has made the heavens and earth, for He has given King David a wise son, endowed with prudence and understanding, who will build a house for Jehovah and a royal house for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.13'>And now I have sent a skillful man, having knowledge and understanding, Huram-abi,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.14'>(the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father, a man of Tyre), knowing how to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, purple and violet, fine linen and crimson, and to make any engraving and to accomplish any plan which may be given to him, with your craftsmen and with the craftsmen of my lord David your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.15'>Now therefore, the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine of which my lord has spoken, let him send to his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.16'>And we will cut timber from Lebanon, as much as you need; we will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, and you will carry it up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.17'>And Solomon numbered all the foreign men who were in the land of Israel, after the census in which David his father had numbered them; and there were found to be one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.18'>And he made seventy thousand of them bearers of burdens, eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred overseers to make the people work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.1'>Thus Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where He had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.2'>And he began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.3'>This is the foundation which Solomon laid for building the house of God: The length was sixty cubits (by cubits according to the former measure) and the width twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.4'>And the porch that was in front of the sanctuary was twenty cubits long across the width of the house, and the height was one hundred and twenty. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.5'>The great house he paneled with cypress which he covered with fine gold, and he put palm trees and chains on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.6'>And he overlaid the house with precious stones for beauty, and the gold was gold from Parvaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.7'>He also covered the house, the beams and thresholds, its walls and doors, with gold; and he engraved cherubim on the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.8'>And he made the house of the Holy of Holies. Its length was the same as the front of the house, twenty cubits, and its width twenty cubits. He covered it with six hundred talents of fine gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.9'>The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold; and he covered the upper chambers with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.10'>In the house of the Holy of Holies he made two cherubim of sculpted work, and overlaid them with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.11'>The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits in length: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing was five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.12'>one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing also was five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.13'>The wings of these cherubim stretching out twenty cubits; standing on their feet, facing the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.14'>And he made the veil of violet, purple, crimson, and fine linen, with raised cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.15'>He also made in front of the house two pillars thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.16'>He made chains, as in the inner sanctuary, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.17'>And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left; he called the name of the one on the right hand Jachin, and the name of the one on the left Boaz.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.1'>Moreover he made a bronze altar: twenty cubits was its length, twenty cubits its width, and ten cubits its height.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.2'>And he made the cast sea, ten cubits from brim to brim, a round circle. Its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits circled around it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.3'>And underneath it were shapes like oxen encircling it all around, ten per cubit, all the way around the Sea. The oxen were cast in two rows, when it was cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.4'>It stood on twelve oxen: three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; the sea was set upon them, with all their back parts inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.5'>It was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It could hold three thousand baths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.6'>He also made ten basins, and put five on the right side and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them, and the sea was for the priests to wash in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.7'>And he made ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance, and set them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.8'>He also made ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred bowls of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.9'>Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court and doors for the court; and he overlaid these doors with bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.10'>He set the sea on the right side, toward the southeast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.11'>And Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls. And Huram finished doing the work that he was to do for King Solomon for the house of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.12'>the two pillars and the bowls and capitals that were on top of the two pillars; the two networks covering the two bowls of the capitals which were on the tops of the pillars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.13'>four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars);</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.14'>he also made the carts and the basins on the carts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.15'>one sea and twelve oxen under it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.16'>also the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all the utensils Huram-abi made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.17'>In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.18'>And Solomon had all these vessels made in such great abundance that the weight of the bronze was not ascertained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.19'>Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of God: the altar of gold and the tables on which was the Bread of the Presence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.20'>the lampstands with their lamps of pure gold, to burn according to the ordinance in front of the inner sanctuary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.21'>with the flowers and the lamps and the snuffers of gold, of purest gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.22'>the snuffers, the bowls, the spoons, and the censers of pure gold. And the entrance of the house, its inner doors to the Holy of Holies, and the doors of the house of the temple, were gold.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.1'>Thus all the work that Solomon had done for the house of Jehovah was finished; and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had consecrated: the silver and the gold and all the articles. And he put them in the treasuries of the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.2'>And Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah up from the City of David, which is Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.3'>And all the men of Israel assembled to the king for the feast, which was in the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.4'>And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.5'>And they brought up the ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests, the Levites, brought them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.6'>Also King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him before the ark, were sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.7'>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the Holy of Holies, under the wings of the cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.8'>For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered over the ark and its poles from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.9'>And the poles were long enough that the ends of the poles of the ark could be seen from in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.10'>Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets which Moses had put there at Horeb, when Jehovah had made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.11'>And it came to pass when the priests came out of the sanctuary (for all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves, without observing their divisions),</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.12'>and the Levites who were singing, all those of Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, were standing to the east of the altar, clothed in white linen, having cymbals, lutes and harps, and with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding the trumpets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.13'>and those sounding the trumpets and those singing were as one, with one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah, to raise their voices with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of song, to praise Jehovah, saying: For He is good, for His mercy is eternal; that the house, the house of Jehovah, was filled with a cloud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.14'>so that the priests could not remain standing to serve before the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.1'>Then Solomon spoke: Jehovah has said He would dwell in the dark cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.2'>I have built You an exalted house, and a place for You to dwell always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.3'>And the king turned his face and blessed the whole assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.4'>And he said: Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, who has fulfilled with His hands what He has spoken with His mouth to my father David, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.5'>Since the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt, I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house, that My name might be there, nor have I chosen any man to be a ruler over My people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.6'>Yet I have chosen Jerusalem, that My name may be there; and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.7'>Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.8'>But Jehovah said to my father David, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well in that it was in your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.9'>Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who will come from your loins, he shall build the house for My name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.10'>Thus Jehovah has fulfilled His word which He has spoken, and I have risen up in place of my father David, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah has spoken; and I have built the house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.11'>And there I have put the ark, in which is the covenant of Jehovah which He has made with the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.12'>And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.13'>(for Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and he stood on it, knelt down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward Heaven),</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.14'>and he said: O Jehovah, God of Israel, there is no God in the heavens or on earth like You, keeping Your covenant and mercy with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.15'>You have kept what You have spoken to Your servant David my father; You have both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.16'>Therefore, O Jehovah, God of Israel, now keep what You have spoken to Your servant David my father, saying, You shall not fail to have a man sitting before Me on the throne of Israel, only if your sons take heed to their way, to walk in My Law as you have walked before Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.17'>And now, O Jehovah, God of Israel, let Your Word be established, which You have spoken to Your servant David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.18'>But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, the heavens and the Heaven of heavens cannot contain You. How much less this house which I have built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.19'>Yet have regard to the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O Jehovah my God, and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before You:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.20'>that Your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, toward the place where You have spoken to put Your name, that You may hear the prayer which Your servant prays toward this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.21'>And may You hear the supplications of Your servant and of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. Hear from Heaven Your dwelling place, and when You have heard, forgive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.22'>If anyone sins against his neighbor, and has been required to swear an oath, and has come with an oath before Your altar in this house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.23'>then hear from Heaven, and act, and judge Your servants, to bring retribution on the wicked to bring his way upon his own head, and to justify the righteous to give him according to his righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.24'>Or if Your people Israel are struck down before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and have returned and confessed Your name, and prayed and made supplication before You in this house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.25'>then hear from Heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You have given to them and their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.26'>When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, when they have prayed toward this place and confessed Your name, and turned from their sin because You afflicted them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.27'>then hear in Heaven, and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.28'>When there is famine in the land, pestilence or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers; when their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever the plague or whatever the sickness;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.7'>Furthermore Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of Jehovah; for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.11'>And Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David to the house he had built for her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David, king of Israel, because the places to which the ark of Jehovah has come are holy.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.12'>And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, besides what she had brought to the king. So she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.13'>The weight of gold that came to Solomon each year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.14'>besides what the traveling merchants and traders brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.18'>The throne had six steps, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne; there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat, with two lions standing beside the armrests.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.9'>And he said to them, What advice do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, Lighten the yoke which your father had put on us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.10'>And the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus you should speak to the people who have spoken to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter on us; thus you shall say to them: My little finger shall be thicker than my fathers loins!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.11'>And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.12'>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, Come back to me the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.13'>And the king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the elders,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.15'>So the king did not consent to the people; for the turn of events was from God, that Jehovah might fulfill His word, which He had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.9'>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the kings house; he took everything. He also carried away the gold shields which Solomon had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.10'>Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them to the hands of the commanders of the runners, who guarded the doorway of the kings house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.11'>And whenever the king entered the house of Jehovah, the runners went and brought them out; then they returned them to the guardroom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.12'>When he humbled himself, the wrath of Jehovah turned back from him, so as not to destroy him completely; and also, conditions were good in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.13'>Thus Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mothers name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.14'>And he did evil, because he had not fixed his heart to seek Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.15'>Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies. And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.16'>So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David. And Abijah his son reigned in his place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.1'>In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.3'>Abijah began the battle with an army of mighty men of war, four hundred thousand choice men. Jeroboam also drew up in battle formation against him with eight hundred thousand choice men, mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.4'>And Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the mountains of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel:</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.8'>And now you think to prevail before the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and you are a great multitude, and with you are the gold calves which Jeroboam made for you as gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.9'>Have you not cast out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made for yourselves priests, like the peoples of other lands, so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of things that are not gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.10'>But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; and the priests who serve Jehovah are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.11'>And they burn with smoke unto Jehovah every morning and every evening, the burnt sacrifices and spiced incense; they also set the Bread in Rows in order on the pure gold table, and the lampstand of gold with its lamps to burn every evening; for we are keeping the command of Jehovah our God, but you have forsaken Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.12'>Now behold, God Himself is with us as our head, and His priests with sounding trumpets to sound the alarm against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against Jehovah the God of your fathers, for you shall not prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.13'>But Jeroboam caused an ambush to go around behind them; so they were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.18'>Thus the sons of Israel were subdued at that time; and the sons of Judah prevailed, because they had trusted on Jehovah the God of their fathers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.1'>So Abijah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet for ten years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.2'>Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.3'>for he removed the foreign altars and the high places, and broke down the sacred pillars and chopped down the groves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.4'>He commanded Judah to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers, and to do the Law and the commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.5'>He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom was quiet before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.6'>And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest; he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.7'>Therefore he said to Judah, Let us build these cities and make walls around them, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought Him, and He has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.8'>And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah who carried shields and spears, and from Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand men who carried shields and drew bows; all these were mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.9'>Then Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.10'>And Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.11'>And Asa cried out unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, it is nothing for You to help, whether with many or with those who have no strength; help us, O Jehovah our God, for we have trusted on You, and in Your name we go against this multitude. O Jehovah, You are our God; do not let man prevail against You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.12'>So Jehovah struck the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.13'>And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar. So the Ethiopians fell, and they could not recover, for they were broken before Jehovah and His army. And they carried away very much spoils.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.16'>He also removed Maachah, the mother of Asa the king, from being queen mother, because she had made a horrible thing for the grove; and Asa cut down her horrible thing, and crushed and burned it by the Brook Kidron.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.1'>In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.2'>And Asa brought silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of Jehovah and of the kings house, and sent to Ben-Hadad king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.3'>Let there be a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold; come, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.4'>So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the commanders of his forces against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.5'>And it happened, when Baasha heard it, that he stopped building Ramah and ceased his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.6'>And King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.7'>At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him: Because you have leaned on the king of Syria, and have not trusted on Jehovah your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.8'>Were the Ethiopians and the Lubim not a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because you trusted on Jehovah, He delivered them into your hand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.5'>Therefore Jehovah established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah gave tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.6'>And his heart was exalted in the ways of Jehovah; moreover he removed the high places and groves out of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.7'>Also in the third year of his reign he sent his rulers, Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.8'>And with them he sent Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.9'>So they taught in Judah, and had the Book of the Law of Jehovah with them; they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.10'>And the fear of Jehovah was on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.12'>So Jehoshaphat went on to become highly magnified, and he built fortresses and storage cities in Judah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.19.2'>And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out before him, and said to King Jehoshaphat, Should you help the wicked and love those hating Jehovah? Therefore wrath is upon you from before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.19.3'>Nevertheless good things have been found in you, in that you have burned the groves from the land, and have fixed your heart to seek God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.19.4'>So Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the mountains of Ephraim, and brought them back to Jehovah the God of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.19.5'>And he appointed judges throughout the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.19.6'>and said to the judges, Take heed to what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for Jehovah, who is with you in the words of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.19.7'>Now therefore, let the fear of Jehovah be upon you; take heed and do it, for there is no injustice with Jehovah our God, no partiality, nor taking of bribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.19.8'>Moreover in Jerusalem, for the judgment of Jehovah and for disputes, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the chief fathers of Israel of the Levites and priests, who were brought back to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.19.9'>And he commanded them, saying, You shall do this in the fear of Jehovah, in faithfulness and with a perfect heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.19.10'>Whatever case comes to you from your brethren who dwell in their cities, whether of bloodshed or offenses against Law or commandment, against statutes or ordinances, you shall warn them, that they not trespass against Jehovah and wrath come upon you and your brethren. Do this, and you shall not be guilty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.19.11'>And behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Jehovah; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the kings matters; also the Levites will be officials before you. Deal firmly, and Jehovah will be with the good.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.20'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.1'>And it happened after this that the sons of Moab and the sons of Ammon, along with others besides the Ammonites, came to battle against Jehoshaphat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.2'>And some came and reported to Jehoshaphat, saying, A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, from Syria; and they are in Hazazon Tamar (which is En Gedi).</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.3'>And Jehoshaphat feared, and set his face to seek Jehovah, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.4'>So Judah gathered together to seek the face of Jehovah; and from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the face of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.5'>And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, before the new court,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.6'>and said: O Jehovah the God of our fathers, are You not God in Heaven, and do You not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations, and in Your hand is there not power and might, so that no one is able to withstand You?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.7'>Are You not our God, who drove out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel, and gave it to the seed of Abraham Your friend forever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.8'>And they dwell in it, and have built You a sanctuary in it for Your name, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.9'>If evil comes upon us; sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine; we will stand before this house and before Your face (for Your name is in this house), and cry out to You in our affliction, and You will hear and save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.10'>And now, behold, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, whom You would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them and have not destroyed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.11'>Behold, they are rewarding us by coming to drive us out of Your possession which You have given us to inherit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.12'>O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.13'>Now all Judah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children, were standing before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.14'>Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.15'>And he said, Give attention, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, O King Jehoshaphat. Thus says Jehovah to you: Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but Gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.16'>Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz, and you shall find them at the end of the valley before the wilderness of Jeruel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.17'>You shall not fight in this battle. Station yourselves, stand your ground and see the salvation of Jehovah for you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out before them, for Jehovah is with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.18'>And Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah to prostrate themselves before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.19'>And the Levites of the sons of the Kohathites and of the sons of the Korahites stood up to praise Jehovah the God of Israel with loud voices on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.20'>So they rose early in the morning and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Listen to me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: Trust in Jehovah your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.21'>And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who should sing unto Jehovah, and who should praise the glory of holiness, as they went out before the army and were saying: Give thanks unto Jehovah, for His mercy is eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.22'>And when they began to cry out in songs of praise, Jehovah set ambushes against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were smitten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.23'>For the sons of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy them. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.24'>So when Judah had come to the lookout point at the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and behold, the corpses, fallen to the earth. No one had escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.25'>And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to plunder the spoils, they found among them an abundance of property on the corpses, with precious jewelry, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days plundering the spoils because there was so much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.26'>And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, for there they blessed Jehovah; therefore the name of that place was called The Valley of Berachah to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.27'>Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat at the head of them, to go back to Jerusalem with joy; for Jehovah had made them rejoice over their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.28'>So they came to Jerusalem, with lutes and harps and trumpets, to the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.29'>And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that Jehovah had fought against the enemies of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.30'>So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.31'>So Jehoshaphat was king over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.32'>And he walked in the way of his father Asa, and did not turn aside from it, to do what was right in the eyes of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.33'>Nevertheless the high places were not taken away, for as yet the people had not fixed their hearts to the God of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.34'>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is brought up in the book of the kings of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.35'>After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah had made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, who acted very wickedly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.36'>And he allied himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion Geber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.37'>But Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, Jehovah has broken your works. And the ships were wrecked, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.21'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.1'>And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.2'>He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.3'>Their father gave them many gifts of silver and gold and precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.4'>Now when Jehoram rose to power over the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself and killed all his brothers with the sword, and also others of the rulers of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.5'>Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.6'>And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for he had the daughter of Ahab as a wife; and he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.7'>Yet Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that He had made with David, and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.8'>In his days the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.9'>So Jehoram went out with his commanders, and all his chariots with him. And he rose up by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the commanders of the chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.10'>Thus Edom has been in revolt from under the hand of Judah to this day. At that time Libnah revolted from under his hand, because he had forsaken Jehovah the God of his fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.11'>Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit harlotry, and thrust Judah aside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.12'>And a writing came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus says Jehovah the God of your father David: Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, or in the ways of Asa king of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.13'>but have walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot like the harlotry of the house of Ahab, and also have killed your brothers, those of your fathers household, who were better than yourself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.14'>behold, Jehovah is striking your people with a great blow; your children, your wives, and all your possessions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.15'>and you shall have great sickness with a disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out by reason of the sickness, day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.16'>Moreover Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabians who were near the Ethiopians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.17'>And they came up into Judah and broke through, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the kings house, and also his sons and his wives, so that there was not a son left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.18'>And after all this Jehovah struck him in his intestines with an incurable disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.19'>And it happened in the course of time, after the end of two years, that his intestines came out because of his sickness; so he died from the miserable disease. And his people made no burning for him, like the burnings for his fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.20'>He was thirty-two years old when he became king. He reigned in Jerusalem eight years and, and departed unloved. And they buried him in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.22'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.1'>Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place, for the raiders who came with the Arabians into the camp had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, reigned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.2'>Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.3'>He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was counseling him to do wickedly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.4'>Therefore he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, like the house of Ahab; for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.5'>He also followed their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians struck Joram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.6'>And he returned to Jezreel to heal from the wounds with which he was struck at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.7'>Now Ahaziahs destruction, when he went to Joram, was from God; for when he came, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.8'>And it happened, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziahs brothers who served Ahaziah, that he killed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.9'>He also sought for Ahaziah; and they caught him (he was hiding in Samaria), and brought him to Jehu. When they had killed him, they buried him, because, they said, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no one to retain power over the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.10'>Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and commanded to destroy all the royal seed of the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.11'>But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the kings sons who were being killed, and put him and his nurse in a bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah so that she did not kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.12'>And he was hiding with them in the house of God for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.23'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.1'>In the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and made a covenant with the commanders of hundreds: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.2'>And they went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the chief fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.3'>And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Behold, the kings son shall reign, as Jehovah has spoken of the sons of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.4'>This is what you shall do: One-third of you entering on the Sabbath, of the priests and the Levites, shall be gatekeepers of the doors;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.5'>one-third shall be at the kings house; and one-third at the gate of the foundation. All the people shall be in the courts of the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.6'>But let no one come into the house of Jehovah except the priests and those of the Levites who serve. They may go in, for they are holy; but all the people shall keep the watch of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.7'>And the Levites shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes into the house, let him be put to death. You are to be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.8'>So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each man took his men who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were going out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest had not dismissed the divisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.9'>And Jehoiada the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields which had belonged to King David, that were in the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.10'>And he stationed all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and by the house, all around the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.11'>And they brought out the kings son, put the crown on him, gave him the Testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, Long live the king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.12'>Now when Athaliah heard the sound of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.13'>When she looked, behold, the king was standing by his pillar at the entrance; and the rulers and the trumpeters were by the king. All the people of the land were joyful, blowing trumpets, and singing with instruments of song, and leading in praise. So Athaliah tore her clothes and said, Treason! Treason!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.14'>And Jehoiada the priest brought out the commanders of hundreds who mustered the forces, and said to them, Bring her out of the area of the house, and slay with the sword whoever follows her. For the priest had said, Do not kill her in the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.15'>So they laid hands on her, and she came by way of the entrance of the Horse Gate by the kings house, and they killed her there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.16'>And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, the people, and the king, to be the people of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.17'>And all the people went to the house of Baal, and tore it down. They broke in pieces its altars and images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.18'>Jehoiada also appointed the oversight of the house of Jehovah into the hand of the priests, the Levites, whom David had assigned to the house of Jehovah, to offer the burnt offerings of Jehovah, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with gladness and song, by the hands of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.19'>And he stationed the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of Jehovah, so that no one who was in any way unclean could enter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.20'>And he took the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of Jehovah; and they came through the Upper Gate to the kings house, and made the king sit on the throne of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.21'>So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet, for they had slain Athaliah with the sword.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.24'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.1'>Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.2'>Joash did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.3'>And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he begot sons and daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.4'>Now it happened after this that Joash set his heart to repair the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.5'>And he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you do it quickly. However the Levites did not do it quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.6'>So the king called Jehoiada the chief priest, and said to him, Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the offering of Moses the servant of Jehovah and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of witness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.7'>For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God, and had also offered all the consecrated things of the house of Jehovah to the Baals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.8'>So at the kings command they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.9'>And they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to Jehovah the offering that Moses the servant of God had laid upon Israel in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.10'>And all the rulers and all the people rejoiced, brought and threw into the chest until they were all finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.11'>So it was, at that time, when the chest was brought to the kings official by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, that the kings scribe and the high priests officer came and emptied the chest, and took it and returned it to its place. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.12'>And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah; and they hired masons and craftsmen to repair the house of Jehovah, and also craftsmen in iron and bronze to restore the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.13'>So the workmen labored, and the work of restoration excelled in their hands; they built up the house of God to its proper measure and strengthened it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.14'>When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; they made from it vessels for the house of Jehovah, utensils for serving and offering, spoons and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the days of Jehoiada.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.15'>And Jehoiada grew old and satisfied with days, and died; he was one hundred and thirty years old at his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.16'>And they buried him in the City of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and His house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.17'>And after the death of Jehoiada the rulers of Judah came and bowed down to the king. And the king gave heed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.18'>And they forsook the house of Jehovah the God of their fathers, and served the groves and idols; and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of their trespass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.19'>And He sent prophets to them, to bring them back to Jehovah; and they testified against them, but they would not listen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.20'>And the Spirit of God clothed Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood above the people, and said to them, Thus says God: Why do you transgress the commandments of Jehovah, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken Jehovah, He also has forsaken you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.21'>So they conspired against him, and at the command of the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.22'>Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son; and as he died, he said, May Jehovah take notice, and require it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.23'>So it happened at the turning of the year that the army of Syria came up against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the rulers of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoils to the king of Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.24'>For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; but Jehovah delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers. Thus they executed judgment against Joash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.25'>And when they had withdrawn from him (for they left him severely wounded), his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed. So he died. And they buried him in the City of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.26'>These are the ones who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.27'>Now concerning his sons, and the great many tributes to him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the midrash of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his place.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.25'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.1'>Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.2'>And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, but not with a perfect heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.3'>Now it happened, when the kingdom had been secured to him, that he executed his servants who had killed his father the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.4'>However he did not execute their children, but did as it is written in the Law in the Book of Moses, where Jehovah had commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall the sons be put to death for their fathers; but each shall die for his own sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.5'>Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, according to their fathers houses, throughout all Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them to be three hundred thousand choice men, able to go to war, handling spear and shield.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.6'>He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for one hundred talents of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.7'>But a man of God came to him, saying, O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for Jehovah is not with Israel; with any of the sons of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.8'>But if you do go, do it. Be strong in battle. But even so, God shall make you stumble before the enemy; for God has power to help and to overthrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.9'>And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do about the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel? And the man of God answered, Jehovah has much more than this to give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.10'>So Amaziah dismissed the troops that had come to him from Ephraim, to go back to their place. Therefore their anger burned greatly against Judah, and they returned to their place in burning anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.11'>And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led his people and went to the Valley of Salt and killed ten thousand of the sons of Seir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.12'>And the sons of Judah took captive ten thousand alive, brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were ripped to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.13'>But as for the troops which Amaziah had dismissed, so that they should not go with him to battle, they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon, killed three thousand in them, and plundered much spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.14'>And it came about, after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, set them up to be his gods, and bowed down before them and burned incense to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.15'>Therefore the anger of Jehovah burned against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, Why have you sought the gods of the people, which could not rescue their own people from your hand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.16'>So it was, as he spoke with him, that the king said to him, Have we made you the kings counselor? Stop! Why should you be killed? So the prophet stopped, and said, I know that God has given counsel to destroy you, because you have done this and have not heeded my counsel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.17'>Now Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look each other in the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.18'>And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as wife; and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.19'>Behold, you say that you have struck the Edomites, and your heart is lifted up to boast. Stay at home now; why should you excite yourself to evil, that you should fall; you and Judah with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.20'>But Amaziah would not listen, for it was from God, to deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had resorted to the gods of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.21'>So Joash king of Israel went out; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.22'>And Judah was struck down before Israel, and every man fled to his tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.23'>And Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh; and he brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate; four hundred cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.24'>And he took all the gold and silver, all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, the treasures of the kings house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.25'>And Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.26'>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.27'>After the time that Amaziah turned away from following Jehovah, they conspired treason against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.28'>And they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.1'>And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.2'>He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king rested with his fathers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.6'>And he went out and made war against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities around Ashdod and among the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.7'>God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabians who lived in Gur-Baal, and against the Meunim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.8'>The Ammonites also brought tribute to Uzziah. His fame spread as far as the entrance of Egypt, for he became exceedingly strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.9'>And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the corner of the wall, and fortified them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.10'>He also built towers in the wilderness, and dug many wells, for he had much livestock, both in the lowlands and in the plains; he also had farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in Carmel, for he loved the soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.11'>Moreover Uzziah had forces making war who went out to war by divisions, according to the number of their muster by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the kings commanders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.12'>The total number of heads of fathers of the mighty men of valor was two thousand six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.13'>And under their hand was a military force of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.14'>And Uzziah provided for them, for the entire army, shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and stones for the slings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.15'>And he made devices in Jerusalem, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and large stones. And his fame spread far and wide, for he was marvelously helped till he became strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.16'>But when he was strong his heart was lifted up, to his destruction, for he transgressed against Jehovah his God to enter the temple of Jehovah to burn incense on the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.17'>And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him were eighty priests of Jehovah; valiant men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.18'>And they withstood King Uzziah, and said to him, It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense unto Jehovah, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed! You shall have no honor from Jehovah God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.19'>And Uzziah became enraged; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense. And while he was angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead, before the priests in the house of Jehovah, beside the incense altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.20'>And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked towards him, and behold, on his forehead he was leprous; so they hurried him out of that place. Indeed he also hurried to get out, because Jehovah had struck him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.21'>And King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death. He dwelt in a separate house, because he was a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah. And Jotham his son was over the kings house, judging the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.22'>Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz has written.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.27.5'>He also fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed over them. And the children of Ammon gave him in that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. The children of Ammon paid this to him in the second and third years also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.27.6'>Thus Jotham became mighty, because he had directed his ways before Jehovah his God.</verse>

They struck him, and carried away a great multitude of them as captives, and brought them to Damascus. Then he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him down with a great slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.6'>For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed one hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day, all valiant men, because they had forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.10'>And now you propose to subject the children of Judah and Jerusalem to be your male and female slaves; but do you not also have guilt of your own before Jehovah your God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.11'>Now listen to me, therefore, and return the captives, whom you have taken captive from your brethren, for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.32'>And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these for a burnt offering unto Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.33'>The consecrated things were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.34'>But the priests were too few, so that they were not able to flay all the burnt offerings; therefore their brethren the Levites supported them until the work was ended and until the other priests had consecrated themselves, for the Levites were more upright in heart to consecrate themselves than the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.35'>Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings and with the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.36'>And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced that God had prepared the people, since the thing came about suddenly.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.30'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.1'>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover unto Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.2'>For the king and his rulers and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to keep the Passover in the second month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.3'>For they could not keep it at the regular time, because a sufficient number of priests had not consecrated themselves, nor had the people gathered together at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.4'>And the matter was right in the eyes of the king and all the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.5'>So they established a decree throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover unto Jehovah the God of Israel at Jerusalem, for they had not done it for many days as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.6'>And the runners went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from the king and his rulers, and spoke according to the command of the king: O Children of Israel, return unto Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel; then He will return to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.7'>And do not be like your fathers and your brethren, who have been unfaithful to Jehovah the God of their fathers, so that He gave them up to desolation, as you see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.8'>Now do not stiffen your necks, like your fathers, but give your hands unto Jehovah; and enter His sanctuary, which He has consecrated for all time, and serve Jehovah your God, that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.9'>For if you return to Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before those holding them captive, to come back to this land; for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn His face from you if you return to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.10'>So the runners passed from city to city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun; but they laughed at them, mocking them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.11'>Nevertheless some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.12'>Also the hand of God was on Judah to give them singleness of heart to obey the command of the king and the rulers, at the Word of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.13'>And many people, a very great assembly, gathered at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.14'>They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and they took away all the incense altars and cast them into the Brook Kidron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.15'>Then they slaughtered the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and consecrated themselves, and brought the burnt offerings to the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.16'>They stood in their place according to the ordinance, according to the Law of Moses the man of God; the priests were sprinkling the blood from the hand of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.17'>For many in the assembly had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had charge of the slaughter of the Passover for everyone who was not clean, to consecrate them to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.18'>For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, O good Jehovah, provide atonement for everyone</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.19'>who has prepared his heart to seek God, Jehovah the God of his fathers, though not according to the purification of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.20'>And Jehovah gave heed to Hezekiah and healed the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.21'>So the children of Israel found at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great joy; and the Levites and the priests were praising Jehovah day by day, with loud instruments unto Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.22'>And Hezekiah spoke to the heart of all the Levites who were teaching the good understanding of Jehovah; and they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings and making confession unto Jehovah the God of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.23'>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep the feast another seven days, and they kept it another seven days with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.24'>For Hezekiah king of Judah had given to the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, and the rulers had given to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests consecrated themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.25'>The whole assembly of Judah rejoiced, along with the priests and Levites, all the assembly that came from Israel, the sojourners who came from the land of Israel, and those dwelling in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.26'>So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.27'>Then the priests, the Levites, rose up and blessed the people, and their voice was heard; and their prayer came up to His holy dwelling place, to the heavens.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.1'>Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and broke the sacred pillars in pieces, chopped down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars; from all Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh; until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned to their own cities, each to his possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.2'>And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites according to their divisions, each man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to serve, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.3'>The king also appointed a portion of his possessions for the burnt offerings: for the morning and evening burnt offerings, the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths and the new moons and the set feasts, as it is written in the Law of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.4'>Moreover he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion for the priests and the Levites, that they might grow strong in the Law of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.5'>As soon as the word spread, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of grain and wine, oil and honey, and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.9'>And Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.10'>And Azariah the chief priest, from the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of Jehovah, we have had enough to eat and have plenty left, for Jehovah has blessed His people; and what is left is this great abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.11'>And Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in the house of Jehovah, and they prepared them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.12'>And they faithfully brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the consecrated things; Cononiah the Levite had charge of them, and Shimei his brother was next.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.13'>Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.14'>Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the east gate, was over the freewill offerings to God, to distribute the offerings of Jehovah and the set apart, holy things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.16'>Besides those males from three years old and up who were reckoned by genealogy, they distributed to everyone who entered the house of Jehovah his portion day by day for the service of his charge, according to his division,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.18'>and to all who were reckoned by genealogy; their little ones and their wives, their sons and daughters, the whole company of them; for in their faithfulness they sanctified themselves in holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.19'>Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the common lands of their cities, in each city, there were men who were designated by name to distribute portions to all the males among the priests and to all who were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.20'>Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he did what was good and right and true before Jehovah his God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.5'>And he strengthened himself, built up all the wall that was broken, raised it up to the towers, and built another wall outside; he also restored the Millo in the City of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.6'>And he assigned commanders of war over the people, gathered them together to him in the open place of the city gate, and spoke to their heart, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.9'>After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (but he and all the forces with him laid siege against Lachish), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.16'>Furthermore, his servants spoke against Jehovah God and against His servant Hezekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.17'>He had also written letters to reproach Jehovah the God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.18'>Then they called out with a loud voice in the Jewish language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them and terrify them, that they might capture the city.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.27'>Hezekiah had very great riches and honor. And he made himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of desirable objects;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.15'>And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the Book of the Law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah gave the Book to Shaphan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.16'>So Shaphan carried the Book to the king, bringing the king word, saying, All that was committed to your servants they are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.17'>And they have gathered the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have given it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.18'>Then Shaphan the scribe reported to the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given me a Book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.19'>And it came about, when the king heard the Words of the Law, that he tore his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.20'>And the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.21'>Go, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for those who are left in Israel and Judah, concerning the Words of the Book that has been found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that has been poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the Word of Jehovah, to do according to all that is written in this Book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.22'>So Hilkiah and those from the king went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe. (She was living in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter.) And they spoke to her regarding this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.23'>And she answered them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Tell the man who has sent you to Me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.24'>Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am bringing evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the Book which they have read before the king of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.25'>because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, to provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore My wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.26'>But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus you shall speak to him, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, whose Words you have heard:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.27'>Because your heart has been tender, and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His Words against this place and against its inhabitants, and you humbled yourself before Me, and you tore your clothes and wept before Me, I also have heard you, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.28'>Behold, I am gathering you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I am bringing upon this place and its inhabitants. So they brought back word to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.29'>Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.30'>And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the priests and the Levites, and all the people, great and small. And he read in their ears all the Words of the Book of the Covenant which had been found in the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.31'>And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to do the Words of the covenant that were written in this Book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.32'>And he caused all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. So the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.33'>And Josiah removed all the abominations from all the land of the children of Israel, and caused all who were found in Israel to serve, being subject unto Jehovah their God. All his days they did not depart from following Jehovah the God of their fathers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.35'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.1'>And Josiah kept a Passover unto Jehovah in Jerusalem, and they slaughtered the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.2'>And he stationed the priests at their charges and encouraged them in the service of the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.3'>And he said to the Levites who were teaching all Israel, who were set apart unto Jehovah: Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, has built. It shall not be a burden on your shoulders. Now serve Jehovah your God and His people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.4'>Prepare yourselves according to your fathers houses, according to your divisions, according to the writings of David king of Israel and the writings of Solomon his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.5'>And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers houses of your brethren, the sons of the people, and according to the division of the fathers house of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.6'>Now slaughter the Passover, consecrate yourselves, and prepare them for your brethren, that they may do according to the Word of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.7'>And Josiah gave the sons of the people lambs and young goats from the flock, all for Passover for all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, as well as three thousand oxen; these were from the kings possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.8'>And his rulers contributed willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests two thousand six hundred Passover lambs, and three hundred oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.9'>Also Conaniah, his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, contributed to the Levites five thousand Passover lambs, and five hundred oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.10'>Thus the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their places, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the kings command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.11'>And they slaughtered the Passover lambs; and the priests sprinkled the blood with their hands, while the Levites were flaying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.12'>And they removed the burnt offerings to distribute them by the divisions of the fathers houses to the sons of the people, to offer unto Jehovah, as it is written in the Book of Moses; and also with the oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.13'>They also roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance; and the other holy things they boiled in pots, in kettles, and in pans, and brought them quickly to all the sons of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.14'>Then afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were busy in offering burnt offerings and fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.15'>And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their places, according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the kings seer. Also the gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not leave their service, because their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.16'>Thus all the service of Jehovah was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Jehovah, according to the command of King Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.17'>And the children of Israel found there, kept the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.18'>And there had not been kept in Israel any Passover like that since the days of Samuel the prophet; and none of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover as Josiah kept, with the priests and the Levites, all Judah and Israel found there, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.19'>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.20'>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the house, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates; and Josiah went out to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.21'>But he sent messengers to him, saying, What have I to do with you, O king of Judah? I have not come against you this day, but against the house with which I have war; for God has commanded me to make haste. Refrain from meddling with God, who is with me, that you not be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.22'>Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself so that he might fight with him, and did not heed the words of Necho from the mouth of God. So he came to fight in the Valley of Megiddo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.23'>And the archers shot King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Take me away, for I am severely wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.24'>His servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had, and they brought him to Jerusalem. So he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.25'>Jeremiah also lamented for Josiah. And to this day all the singing men and the singing women speak of Josiah in their lamentations. They made it an ordinance in Israel; and behold, they are written in the Lamentations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.26'>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his goodness, according to what was written in the Law of Jehovah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.27'>and his deeds from first to last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.36'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.1'>And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his fathers place in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.2'>Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.3'>And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem; and he fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.4'>Then the king of Egypt made Jehoahazs brother Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother and brought him to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.5'>Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.6'>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him in bronze fetters to carry him to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.7'>Nebuchadnezzar also brought away some of the vessels from the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.8'>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, the abominations which he had done, and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.9'>Jehoiachin was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days. And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.10'>At the turn of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels from the house of Jehovah, and made Zedekiah, Jehoiakims brother, king over Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.11'>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.12'>And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah his God, and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.13'>And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had adjured him by God; but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.14'>Moreover all the rulers of the priests and the people trespassed with great unfaithfulness, according to all the abominations of the nations, and defiled the house of Jehovah which He had consecrated in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.15'>And Jehovah the God of their fathers sent to them by the hand of His messengers, rising early to send them, because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.16'>But they mocked the messengers of God, despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets, to make the wrath of Jehovah swell up against His people, till there was no healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.17'>Therefore He brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, on the aged or the weak; He gave them all into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.18'>And all the vessels from the house of God, great and small, the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king and of his rulers, all these he carried away to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.19'>And they burned the house of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed every desirable thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.20'>And those who escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon, where they became servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.21'>to fulfill the Word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths. All the days to lay desolate, it kept the Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.22'>And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, to fulfill the Word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and also put it in writing, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.23'>Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: Jehovah the God of the heavens has given to me all the kingdoms of the earth; and He has laid a charge upon me to build Him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah.
