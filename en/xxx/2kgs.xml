      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.1'>Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.2'>Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria, and was ill; so he sent messengers and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.3'>And the Angel of Jehovah spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.4'>Now therefore, thus says Jehovah: You shall not come down from the bed on which you have gone up, but you shall die the death. And Elijah departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.5'>And when the messengers returned to him, he said to them, Why have you come back?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.6'>And they said to him, A man came up to meet us, and said to us, Go, return to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed upon which you have gone up, but you shall die the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.7'>And he said to them, What kind of man was it who came up to meet you and spoke to you these words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.8'>So they answered him, A hairy man girded with a leather waistband around his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.9'>Then the king sent to him a commander of fifty with his fifty. So he went up to him; and behold, he was sitting on the top of a hill. And he spoke to him: Man of God, the king has said, Come down!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.10'>And Elijah answered and said to the commander of fifty, If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the heavens and consume you and your fifty. And fire came down from the heavens and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.11'>Then he sent to him another commander of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said to him: Man of God, thus has the king said, Come down quickly!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.12'>And Elijah answered and said to them, If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the heavens and consume you and your fifty. And the fire of God came down from the heavens and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.13'>Again, he sent a third commander of fifty with his fifty. And the third commander of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and implored him, and said to him: Man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.14'>Behold, fire has come down from the heavens and burned up the first two commanders of fifties with their fifties. But let my life now be precious in your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.15'>And the Angel of Jehovah said to Elijah, Go down with him; do not be afraid of him. So he arose and went down with him to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.16'>And he said to him, Thus says Jehovah: Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His Word? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed upon which you have gone up, but you shall die the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.17'>So Ahaziah died according to the Word of Jehovah which Elijah had spoken. Because he had no son, Jehoram became king in his place, in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.18'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.1'>And it came to pass, when Jehovah was about to take Elijah up into Heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah and Elisha went from Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.2'>Then Elijah said to Elisha, Stay here, please, for Jehovah has sent me on to Bethel. But Elisha said, As Jehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you! So they went down to Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.3'>And the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, Do you know that Jehovah will take away your master from over you today? And he said, Yes, I know; keep silent!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.4'>Then Elijah said to him, Elisha, stay here, please, for Jehovah has sent me on to Jericho. But he said, As Jehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you! So they came to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.5'>And the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him, Do you know that Jehovah will take away your master from over you today? And he answered, Yes, I know; keep silent!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.6'>Then Elijah said to him, Stay here, please, for Jehovah has sent me on to the Jordan. But he said, As Jehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you! So the two of them went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.7'>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood in view of them at a distance, while the two of them stood by the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.8'>And Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the water; and it was divided this way and that, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.9'>And so it was, when they had crossed over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask! What shall I do for you, before I am taken away from you? And Elisha said, Please let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.10'>And he said, You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.11'>And it happened as they continued on and talked, that behold, a chariot of fire appeared with horses of fire, and separated the two of them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.12'>And Elisha was watching and crying out, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen! So he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.13'>He also took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.14'>And he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and said, Where is Jehovah the God of Elijah? And when he also had struck the water, it was divided this way and that; and Elisha crossed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.15'>And when the sons of the prophets from Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.16'>And they said to him, Behold now, there are fifty strong men with your servants. Please let them go and search for your master, lest perhaps the Spirit of Jehovah has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley. And he said, You shall not send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.17'>And when they pressed him till he was ashamed, he said, Send! So they sent fifty men, and they searched for three days but did not find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.18'>And when they came back to him (for he had stayed in Jericho), he said to them, Did I not say to you, Do not go?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.19'>And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the ground barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.20'>And he said, Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it. So they brought it to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.21'>And he went out to the spring of the water, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus says Jehovah: I have healed this water; from it there shall be no more death or barrenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.22'>Thus the waters remain healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.23'>And he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up the road, some little boys came from the city and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.24'>And he turned around and looked at them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And two bears came out of the forest and ripped apart forty-two of the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.25'>And he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.1'>Now Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.2'>And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, but not like his father and mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.3'>Nevertheless he clung to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin; he did not depart from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.4'>Now Mesha the king of Moab was a raiser of sheep, and he had brought to the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.5'>But it happened, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.6'>So King Jehoram went out of Samaria that day and mustered all of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.7'>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab? And he said, I will go up; I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.8'>And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, By way of the wilderness of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.9'>So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they made a circuit of a seven days journey; and there was no water for the camp, nor for the cattle at their feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.10'>And the king of Israel said, Alas! For Jehovah has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.11'>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not a prophet of Jehovah here, that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.12'>And Jehoshaphat said, The Word of Jehovah is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.13'>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother. But the king of Israel said to him, No, for Jehovah has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.14'>And Elisha said, As Jehovah of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not pay attention to you, nor look at you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.15'>But now bring me a minstrel. And it happened, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah came upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.16'>And he said, Thus says Jehovah: Make this valley full of ditches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.17'>For thus says Jehovah: You shall not see wind, nor shall you see rain; yet the valley shall be filled with water, so that you, your cattle, and your animals may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.18'>And this is but a slight thing in the eyes of Jehovah; He has also delivered the Moabites into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.19'>Also you shall strike every fortified city and every choice city, and shall cut down every good tree, and stop up every spring of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.20'>And it happened in the morning, when the grain offering was offered, that behold, water came by way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.21'>And when all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to bear arms and older were gathered; and they took their stand at the border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.22'>And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun was shining on the water; and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.23'>And they said, This is blood; the kings have laid waste to make desolate, and have struck down one another; now therefore, Moab, to the spoils!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.24'>So when they came to the camp of Israel, Israel rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they entered, striking to kill the Moabites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.25'>And they tore down the cities, and each man threw a stone on every good piece of land and filled it; and they stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees. But they left the stones of Kir Haraseth. However the slingers surrounded and struck it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.26'>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle had prevailed against him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.27'>Then he took his firstborn son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel; so they departed from him and returned to their own land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.1'>Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared Jehovah. And the creditor is coming to take my two children to be his slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.2'>And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house? And she said, Your maidservant has nothing in the house but a flask of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.3'>Then he said, Go, borrow vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors; empty vessels; do not gather just a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.4'>And when you have come in, you shall shut the door behind you and your sons; and pour it into all those vessels, and set aside the full ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.5'>So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured it out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.6'>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me another vessel. And he said to her, There is not another vessel. And the oil stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.7'>Then she came and reported to the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.8'>And it happened one day that Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a notable woman, and she prevailed upon him to eat food. So it was, as often as he passed by, he would turn aside there to eat food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.9'>And she said to her husband, Behold now, I know that this is a holy man of God, who passes by us continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.10'>Please, let us make a small walled upper room; and let us put a bed for him there, and a table and a chair and a lampstand; and it shall be, whenever he comes to us, he can turn aside there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.11'>And the day came that he came there, and he turned in to the upper room and lay down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.12'>And he said to Gehazi his servant, Summon this Shunammite. And when he had summoned her, she stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.13'>And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, you have been concerned for us with all this care. What shall I do for you? Shall I speak on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army? She answered, I am dwelling among my own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.14'>So he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Truly, she has no son, and her husband is old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.15'>And he said, Summon her. When he had summoned her, she stood in the doorway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.16'>And he said, At the appointed time according to the time of life you shall embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord. Man of God, do not lie to your maidservant!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.17'>And the woman conceived and bore a son at the appointed time, according to the time of life, as Elisha had spoken to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.18'>When the child was grown, it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.19'>And he said to his father, My head, my head! So he said to a servant, Carry him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.20'>When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.21'>And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door upon him, and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.22'>And she called to her husband, and said, Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.23'>And he said, Why are you going to him today? It is neither the new moon nor the sabbath. And she said, It will be well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.24'>And she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, Lead on and go; do not slacken the pace for me unless I say so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.25'>So she departed, and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. And so it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, Behold, the Shunammite!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.26'>Please run now to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.27'>And when she came to the man of God at the hill, she took hold of his feet; and Gehazi came near to push her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is bitter, and Jehovah has hidden it from me, and has not told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.28'>And she said, Did I ask a son of my lord? Did I not say, Do not deceive me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.29'>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet anyone, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not answer him; but lay my staff on the face of the boy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.30'>And the mother of the boy said, As Jehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So he arose and went after her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.31'>And Gehazi went on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the boy; but there was neither voice nor hearing. Therefore he went back to meet him, and reported to him, saying, The boy has not awakened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.32'>And when Elisha came into the house, behold, the boy was dead, lying on his bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.33'>So he went in, shut the door behind the two of them, and prayed unto Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.34'>And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands; and he stretched himself out on the child, and the flesh of the child became warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.35'>He returned and walked back and forth in the house, and again went up and stretched himself out on him; then the boy sneezed seven times, and the boy opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.36'>And he summoned Gehazi and said, Summon this Shunammite. So he summoned her. And when she came in to him, he said, Take up your son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.37'>And she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground, and took up her son and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.38'>And Elisha returned to Gilgal. Now there was a famine in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, Put on the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.39'>And one of them went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and sliced them into the pot of stew, though they did not know what they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.40'>And they poured out for the men to eat. And it happened, as they were eating the stew, that they cried out and said, Man of God, there is death in the pot! And they could not eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.41'>So he said, Then bring some flour. And he put it into the pot, and said, Pour it out for the people, that they may eat. And there was nothing harmful in the pot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.42'>And a man came from Baal Shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley bread, and fresh heads of grain in his sack. And he said, Give it to the people, that they may eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.43'>But his servant said, What? Shall I set this before one hundred men? He said again, Give it to the people, that they may eat; for thus says Jehovah: They shall eat and have some left over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.44'>So he set it before them; and they ate and had some left over, according to the Word of Jehovah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.1'>Now Naaman, a chief of the army of the king of Syria, was a great and honorable man before his master, because by him Jehovah had given deliverance to Syria. He was also a mighty man of valor, but a leper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.2'>And the Syrians had gone out on raids, and had brought back captive a little girl from the land of Israel; and she was before Naamans wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.3'>And she said to her mistress, If only my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria! For he would take away his leprosy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.4'>And he went in and told his master, saying, Thus and thus has spoken the girl, who is from the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.5'>And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. So he departed and took in his hand ten talents of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.6'>Then he came to the king of Israel with the letter which said, As this letter comes to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may take away his leprosy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.7'>And it happened, when the king of Israel read the letter, that he tore his clothes and said, Am I God, to kill and make alive, that this man sends a man to me to take away his leprosy? Therefore please consider, and see how he seeks a quarrel with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.8'>So it was, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have you torn your clothes? Please let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.9'>So Naaman went with his horses and chariot, and stood at the door of Elishas house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.10'>And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored to you, and you shall be clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.11'>But Naaman was furious, and went away and said, Behold I thought He would go forth to come out to me, and would have stood and called upon the name of Jehovah his God, and waved his hand over the place, and taken away the leprosy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.12'>Are not the Abanah and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.13'>And his servants came near and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he says to you, Wash, and be clean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.14'>So he went down and dipped seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little boy, and he was clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.15'>And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came and stood before him; and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel; now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.16'>But he said, As Jehovah lives, before whom I stand, I shall take nothing. And he pressed him to take it, but he refused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.17'>So Naaman said, Then, if not, please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth; for your servant will no longer offer either burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but unto Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.18'>Yet in this thing may Jehovah pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to bow down there, and he supports himself on my hand, and I bow down in the house of Rimmon; when I bow down in the house of Rimmon, may Jehovah please pardon your servant in this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.19'>And he said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a short distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.20'>But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving from his hands what he brought; but as Jehovah lives, I will run after him and take something from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.21'>So Gehazi ran after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.22'>And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the mountains of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.23'>And Naaman said, Please, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and handed them to two of his servants; and they carried them before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.24'>And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and deposited them in the house; and he sent the men away, and they departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.25'>And he went in and stood before his master; and Elisha said to him, Where have you been, Gehazi? And he said, Your servant did not go anywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.26'>Then he said to him, Did not my heart go with you when the man turned back from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money and to receive clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, male and female servants?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.27'>Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and your seed always. And he went out from his presence leprous as snow.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.1'>And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, See now, the place where we are dwelling with you is too small for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.2'>Please, let us go to the Jordan, and let every man take a beam from there, and let us make there a place where we may dwell. So he answered, Go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.3'>Then one of them said, Please consent to go with your servants. And he answered, I will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.4'>So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.5'>But as one was cutting down a log, the iron ax head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, Alas, master! For it was borrowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.6'>And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. So he cut off a stick, and threw it in there, and the iron floated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.7'>Therefore he said, Pick it up for yourself. So he extended his hand and took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.8'>Now the king of Syria was making war against Israel; and he consulted with his servants, saying, My camp will be in such and such a place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.9'>And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are coming down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.10'>Then the king of Israel sent someone to the place of which the man of God had told him. Thus he warned him, and he was watchful there, not just once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.11'>Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was enraged over this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, Will you not report to me which of us is for the king of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.12'>And one of his servants said, No one, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.13'>So he said, Go and see where he is, that I may send and seize him. And it was reported to him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.14'>Therefore he sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.15'>And when the servant of the man of God arose early and went out, behold, the army was surrounding the city with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master! What shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.16'>So he answered, Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.17'>And Elisha prayed, and said, Jehovah, I pray, open his eyes that he may see. And Jehovah opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.18'>And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to Jehovah, and said, Strike this people, I pray, with blindness. And He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.19'>And Elisha said to them, This is not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek. But he led them to Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.20'>And so it was, when they had come to Samaria, that Elisha said, Jehovah, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And Jehovah opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the middle of Samaria!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.21'>Now when the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, My father, shall I smite them? Shall I smite them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.22'>But he answered, You shall not smite them. Would you kill those whom you have taken captive with your sword and your bow? Set food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.23'>So he prepared a great feast for them; and after they ate and drank, he sent them away and they went to their master. So the marauding bands from Syria came no more into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.24'>And it happened after this that Ben-Hadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.25'>And there was a great famine in Samaria; and behold, they besieged it until a donkeys head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and one-fourth of a kab of dove droppings for five shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.26'>And as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.27'>And he said, If Jehovah does not help you, where can I find help for you? From the threshing floor or from the winepress?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.28'>And the king said to her, What is troubling you? And she answered, This woman said to me, Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.29'>So we boiled my son, and ate him. And I said to her on the next day, Give your son, that we may eat him; but she hid her son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.30'>And it happened when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes; and as he passed by on the wall, the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth inside on his flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.31'>Then he said, God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.32'>And Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And the king sent a man before him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent someone to take away my head? Behold, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door. Is not the sound of his masters feet behind him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.33'>And while he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger was coming down to him; and he said, Behold, this evil is from Jehovah; why should I wait for Jehovah any longer?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.1'>Then Elisha said, Hear the Word of Jehovah. Thus says Jehovah: Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.2'>So an officer on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said, Behold, if Jehovah would make windows in the heavens, could this thing be? And he said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.3'>Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said to one another, Why are we sitting here until we will have died?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.4'>If we say, We will enter the city, the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit here, we are also dead. Now therefore, come, let us fall to the camp of the Syrians. If they keep us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.5'>And they rose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians; and when they had come to the edge of the Syrian camp, behold, no one was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.6'>For Jehovah had caused the camp of the Syrians to hear the sound of chariots and the sound of horses, the sound of a great army; so they said to one another, Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to come upon us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.7'>Therefore they arose and fled at twilight, and left the camp; their tents, their horses, and their donkeys; and they fled for their lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.8'>And when the lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank, and carried from it silver and gold and clothing, and went and hid them; then they came back and entered another tent, and carried some from there also, and went and hid it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.9'>Then they said to one another, We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we are remaining silent. If we wait until morning light, some punishment will come upon us. Now therefore, come, let us go and tell the kings household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.10'>So they went and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and reported to them, saying, We went to the Syrian camp, and behold, no one was there, no voice of man; only horses and donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.11'>And the gatekeepers called out, and they reported it to the kings household inside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.12'>So the king arose in the night and said to his servants, Let me now tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.13'>And one of his servants answered and said, Please, let several men take five of the remaining horses which are left in the city. Behold, they may either become like all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; or behold, they may become like all the multitude of Israel left from those who are consumed; so let us send them and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.14'>Therefore they took two chariots with horses; and the king sent them after the Syrian camp, saying, Go and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.15'>And they went after them to the Jordan; and behold, all the way was full of garments and weapons which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. So the messengers returned and reported to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.16'>Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians. And a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, according to the Word of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.17'>Now the king had appointed the officer on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate. But the people trampled him in the gate, and he died, just as the man of God had spoken, who had spoken when the king came down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.18'>So it happened just as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two seahs of barley for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, shall be sold tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.19'>And that officer had answered the man of God, and said, Now behold, if Jehovah would make windows in the heavens, could such a thing be? And he had said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.2'>So the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of God, and she went with her household and dwelt in the land of the Philistines seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.3'>And it came to pass, at the end of seven years, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines; and she went to cry out to the king for her house and for her land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.6'>And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed a certain officer to her, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the proceeds of the fields from the day that she left the land until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.7'>And Elisha came to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Syria was sick; and it was reported to him, saying, The man of God has come here.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.12'>And Hazael said, Why is my lord weeping? He answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: Their strongholds you will set on fire, and their young men you will kill with the sword; and you will dash their children, and rip open their women with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.13'>And Hazael said, But what is your servant; a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, Jehovah has shown me that you will become king over Syria.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.6'>And he arose and went into the house. And he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: I have anointed you king over the people of Jehovah, over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.7'>And you shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Jehovah, at the hand of Jezebel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.8'>For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I shall cut off from Ahab all those who urinate against a wall in Israel, both bond and free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.9'>Thus I shall make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.10'>The dogs shall eat Jezebel on the plot of ground at Jezreel, for there shall be no one to bury her. And he opened the door and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.11'>Then Jehu came out to the servants of his master, and one of them said to him, Is all well? Why did this madman come to you? And he said to them, You know the man and his talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.12'>And they said, A lie! Tell us now. So he said, Thus and thus he has spoken to me, saying, Thus says Jehovah: I have anointed you king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.13'>Then each man hastened to take his garment and put it under him on the top of the steps; and they blew the shofar, saying, Jehu is king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.14'>So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had been defending Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, against Hazael king of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.15'>But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to be healed from the wounds with which the Syrians had struck him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If you are so minded, let no one leave or escape from the city to go and report it in Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.16'>So Jehu rode and went to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there; and Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.17'>Now a watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a multitude. And Joram said, Get a horseman and send him to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.18'>So the horseman went to meet him, and said, Thus says the king: Is it peace? And Jehu said, What have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me. So the watchman reported, saying, The messenger went to them, but has not returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.19'>Then he sent out a second horseman who came to them, and said, Thus says the king: Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.20'>So the watchman reported, saying, He went up to them and has not returned; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives madly!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.21'>Then Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot; and they went out to meet Jehu, and met him on the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.22'>And it happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? So he answered, What peace, as long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft are so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.23'>Then Joram turned his hands and fled, and said to Ahaziah, Treachery, O Ahaziah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.24'>And Jehu drew his bow with full strength and shot Jehoram between his arms; and the arrow came out at his heart, and he sank down in his chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.25'>Then Jehu said to Bidkar his officer, Pick him up, and throw him into the parcel of the land of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember, when you and I were riding together behind Ahab his father, that Jehovah had laid this burden upon him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.26'>Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, says Jehovah, and I will repay you in this plot, says Jehovah. Now therefore, take and throw him on the plot of ground, according to the Word of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.27'>And when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu pursued him, and said, Strike him also in the chariot, at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.28'>And his servants carried him in the chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the City of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.29'>In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.30'>Now when Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she put black paint on her eyes and adorned her head, and looked down through a window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.31'>And as Jehu had entered at the gate, she said, Is it peace, Zimri, murderer of your master?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.32'>And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? Who? And two or three officials looked down at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.33'>And he said, Throw her down! So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses; and he trampled her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.34'>And when he came in, he ate and drank. Then he said, Go now, see to this accursed woman, and bury her, for she was a kings daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.35'>And they went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.36'>Therefore they came back and reported to him. And he said, This is the Word of Jehovah, which He has spoken by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.37'>and the corpse of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the land, in the plot at Jezreel, so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.1'>Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote and sent letters to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to those rearing Ahabs sons, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.2'>Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your masters sons are with you, and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and weapons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.3'>choose the best and most upright of your masters sons, set him on his fathers throne, and fight for your masters house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.4'>But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings have not stood before him; how then can we stand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.5'>And he who was over the house, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those rearing the sons, sent to Jehu, saying, We are your servants, we will do all you tell us; but we will not make anyone king. Do what is good in your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.6'>Then he wrote a second letter to them, saying: If you are for me and will obey my voice, take the heads of the men, your masters sons, and come to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow. Now the kings sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who were rearing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.7'>So it was, when the letter came to them, that they took the kings sons and slaughtered seventy persons, put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.8'>And a messenger came and reported to him, saying, They have brought the heads of the kings sons. And he said, Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.9'>And it came about in the morning, that he went out and stood, and said to all the people, You are righteous. Behold, I have conspired against my master and killed him; but who killed all these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.10'>Know now that nothing has fallen to the earth of the Word of Jehovah which Jehovah has spoken concerning the house of Ahab; for Jehovah has done what He has spoken by the hand of His servant Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.11'>Thus Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men and his acquaintances and his priests, until he left him no one remaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.12'>And he arose and departed and went to Samaria. On the way, at the house of the shepherds at Beth Eked,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.13'>Jehu met the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are you? And they answered, We are the brothers of Ahaziah; we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.14'>And he said, Take them alive! So they took them alive, and killed them at the well of Beth Eked, forty-two men; and he left none of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.15'>And when he departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab, coming to meet him; and he blessed him and said to him, Is your heart upright, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. Jehu said, If it is, give me your hand. So he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.16'>Then he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah. So they made him ride in his chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.17'>And when he came to Samaria, he killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed them, according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken to Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.18'>Then Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little, Jehu shall serve him much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.19'>Now therefore, call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests. Let no one be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever is missing shall not live. But Jehu acted with cunning, in order to destroy those serving Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.20'>And Jehu said, Consecrate a solemn assembly to Baal. So they proclaimed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.21'>Then Jehu sent throughout all Israel; and all those serving Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. So they came into the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was full from one end to the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.22'>And he said to the one over the wardrobe, Bring out the vestments for all those serving Baal. So he brought out vestments for them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.24'>So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed for himself eighty men outside, and had said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escapes, whoever lets him escape, it shall be his soul for the soul of the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.25'>Now it happened, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the runners and the officers, Go in and strike them; let no one come out! And they killed them with the edge of the sword; then the runners and the officers threw them out, and went into the city of the house of Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.26'>And they brought the sacred pillars out of the house of Baal and burned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.27'>Then they broke down the sacred pillar of Baal, and tore down the house of Baal and made it an outhouse to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.28'>Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.29'>However Jehu did not turn away from after the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin, that is, from the golden calves that were at Bethel and Dan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.30'>And Jehovah said to Jehu, Because you have done well in doing what is right in My eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab all that was in My heart, your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.31'>But Jehu took no heed to walk in the Law of Jehovah the God of Israel with all his heart; for he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, who had made Israel sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.32'>In those days Jehovah began to cut off Israel; and Hazael struck them in all the territory of Israel</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.33'>from the Jordan eastward: all the land of Gilead; Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh; from Aroer, which is by the River Arnon, including Gilead and Bashan.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.11.1'>When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son had died, she arose and destroyed all the royal seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.11.2'>But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the kings sons who were being murdered; and they hid him and his nurse in the bedroom, from Athaliah, so that he was not killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.11.3'>So he was hidden with her in the house of Jehovah for six years, while Athaliah was reigning over the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.11.4'>In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the commanders of hundreds, the mercenaries and runners, and brought them into the house of Jehovah to him.

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.11.5'>And he commanded them, saying, This is what you shall do: One-third of you who come on the Sabbath shall be keeping watch over the kings house,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.11.9'>Thus the commanders of the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each of them took his men who were going in on the Sabbath, with those who were going out on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.11.10'>And the priest gave the commanders of hundreds the spears and shields which had belonged to King David, that were in the house of Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.11.16'>So they laid hands on her; and she went by way of the horses entrance into the kings house, and there she was put to death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.24'>Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Ava, Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they took possession of Samaria and dwelt in its cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.25'>And it was so, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they did not fear Jehovah; therefore Jehovah sent lions among them, which killed some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.26'>So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations whom you have removed and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the ordinances of the God of the land; therefore He has sent lions among them, and behold, they are killing them because they do not know the ordinances of the God of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.27'>So the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Send there one of the priests whom you have brought from there; let him go and dwell there, and let him teach them the ordinances of the God of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.28'>Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.29'>However nation by nation they continued making gods of their own, and put them in the houses on the high places which those from Samaria had made, nation by nation in the cities where they were living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.30'>The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.31'>and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.32'>So they feared Jehovah; and from among all of them they appointed for themselves priests of the high places, who attended to the houses of the high places for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.33'>They feared Jehovah, and also served their own gods; according to the manner of the nations from where they were carried away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.34'>To this day they continue doing according to the former manner; they do not fear Jehovah, nor do they follow their statutes or their ordinances, or the Law and commandments which Jehovah has commanded the sons of Jacob, whom He had ordained with the name, Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.35'>with whom Jehovah had made a covenant and charged them, saying: You shall not fear other gods, nor bow down to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.36'>but Jehovah, who has brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm, Him you shall fear, to Him you shall bow down, and to Him you shall offer sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.37'>And the statutes, the ordinances, the Law, and the commandments which He has written for you, you shall take heed to do forever; you shall not fear other gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.38'>And the covenant that I have made with you, you shall not forget, nor shall you fear other gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.39'>But Jehovah your God you shall fear; and He shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.40'>However they have not obeyed, but are doing according to their former manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.41'>Thus these nations feared Jehovah, while also serving their graven images. And their children and their childrens children have continued doing as their fathers have done, even to this day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.5'>He trusted in Jehovah the God of Israel, so that after him was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, nor who were before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.6'>For he clung to Jehovah; he did not turn aside from following after Him, but kept His commandments, which Jehovah had commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.7'>Jehovah was with him; he prospered wherever he went. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.33'>Have any of the gods of the nations at all delivered its land from the hand of the king of Assyria?</verse>
