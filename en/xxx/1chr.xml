        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.17'>And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if to betray me to my enemies, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers see it and judge.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.19'>Some from Manasseh had fallen out to David when he was going with the Philistines to battle against Saul; but they did not help them, for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after taking counsel, saying, He may fall out to his master Saul with our heads.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.32'>of the sons of Issachar who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, their chiefs were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their command;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.33'>of Zebulun there were fifty thousand who could go out to war and set the battle in array with all implements of war, to help with undivided heart;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.38'>All these men of war, who could keep ranks, came to Hebron with a perfect heart, to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest of Israel were of one heart to make David king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.39'>And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their brethren had prepared for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.40'>Moreover those who were near to them, from as far away as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, were bringing food on donkeys and camels, on mules and oxen; provisions of flour and cakes of figs and cakes of raisins, wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly, for there was joy in Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Chr.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.1'>And David consulted with the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.2'>And David said to all the assembly of Israel, If it seems good to you, and it is of Jehovah our God, let us send out and broadcast to our brethren everywhere who are left in all the land of Israel, and to the priests and Levites who are with them in their cities and their common lands, that they may gather together to us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.3'>and let us bring around the ark of our God to us, for we have not inquired at it since the days of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.4'>And all the assembly responded to do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.5'>So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.6'>And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, to Kirjath Jearim of Judah, to bring up from there the ark of Jehovah God, who dwells between the cherubim, where His name has been proclaimed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.7'>And they made the ark of God ride on a new cart from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio were leading the cart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.8'>And David and all Israel were making sport before God with all their might, with singing, with harps, with lutes, with tambourines, with cymbals, and with trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.9'>And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to take hold of the ark, for the oxen had fallen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.10'>And the anger of Jehovah burned against Uzza, and He struck him because he had put his hand on the ark; and he died there before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.11'>And David was furious because Jehovah had violently burst forth upon Uzza; therefore that place is called Perez Uzza to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.12'>And David feared God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.13'>So David did not take away the ark with him into the City of David, but turned it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.14'>And the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And Jehovah blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that he had.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Chr.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.1'>Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar timber, with masons and craftsmen, to build him a house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.2'>Thus David perceived that Jehovah had established him as king over Israel, for his kingdom had been exalted on high for the sake of His people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.3'>And David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David begot more sons and daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.4'>And these are the names of his sons whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.8'>Now when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it and went out to face them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.9'>And the Philistines went and made a raid on the Valley of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.10'>And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Have You delivered them into my hand? And Jehovah said to him, Go up, for I have delivered them into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.11'>So they went up to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there. And David said, God has broken through to my enemies by my hand like a breakthrough of water. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.12'>And when they left their gods there, David commanded, and they were burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.13'>The Philistines again made a raid on the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.14'>And David again inquired of God, and God said to him, You shall not go up after them; circle around them, and come upon them in front of the balsam trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.15'>And it shall be, when you hear a sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall go out to battle, for God has gone out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.16'>So David did as God had commanded him, and they struck the camp of the Philistines from Gibeon as far as Gezer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.17'>And Davids fame went out into all the lands, for Jehovah had put the dread of him upon all the nations.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.11'>And David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.12'>and he said to them, You are the heads of the fathers of the Levites; consecrate yourselves, you and your brethren, that you may bring up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel to the place I have prepared for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.13'>For because you did not do it the first time, Jehovah our God has burst out against us, because we had not inquired of Him concerning the ordinance.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.19'>The singers: Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, to sound the cymbals of bronze.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.1'>Now it came to pass, when David had been dwelling in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Behold now, I am dwelling in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is under curtains.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.19.4'>Therefore Hanun took Davids servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, at their buttocks, and sent them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.19.5'>Then some went and reported to David about the men; and he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.21.5'>And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. All Israel had one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and Judah had four hundred and seventy thousand men who drew the sword.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Chr.28'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.1'>Now David assembled at Jerusalem all the rulers of Israel: the chiefs of the tribes and the leaders of the divisions who served the king, the commanders over thousands and commanders over hundreds, and the officials over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the overseers, the mighty men, and all the men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.2'>And King David rose to his feet and said, Hear me, my brethren and my people: I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and for the footstool of our God, and had made preparations to build it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.3'>But God has said to me, You shall not build a house for My name, because you have been a man of war and have shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.4'>However Jehovah the God of Israel chose me above all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever, for He has chosen Judah as the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father, He has been pleased to make me king over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.5'>And of all my sons (for Jehovah has given me many sons) He has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of Jehovah, over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.6'>And He said to me, Your son Solomon shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him as My son, and I will be his Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.7'>Moreover I will establish his kingdom forever, if he prevails to do My commandments and My judgments, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.8'>Now therefore, in the eyes of all Israel the assembly of Jehovah, and in the ears of our God, take heed to seek out all the commandments of Jehovah your God, that you may possess this good land, and leave it as an inheritance for your children after you always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.9'>As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Jehovah searches all hearts and understands all the intent of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.10'>Consider now, for Jehovah has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong, and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.11'>Then David gave his son Solomon the pattern for the porch, its houses, its treasuries, its upper chambers, its inner chambers, and the place of the mercy seat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.12'>and the pattern for all that he had by the Spirit, of the courts of the house of Jehovah, of all the chambers all around, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries for the consecrated things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.13'>also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and for all the vessels of service in the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.14'>Gold by weight for the things of gold, for all the vessels used in every kind of service; also silver for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all the vessels used in every kind of service;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.15'>the weight for the lampstands of gold, and their lamps of gold, by weight for each lampstand and its lamps; for the lampstands of silver by weight, for the lampstand and its lamps, according to the service of each lampstand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.16'>And by weight, the gold for the tables of the Bread in Rows, for each table, and silver for the tables of silver;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.17'>also pure gold for the forks, the bowls, the pitchers of pure gold, and the golden basins; gold by weight for every basin; and for the silver basins, silver by weight for every basin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.18'>and refined gold by weight for the altar of incense, and for the construction of the chariot, that is, the gold cherubim that spread their wings and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.19'>All this, said David, Jehovah has given me insight in writing, by His hand upon me, all these patterns of the workmanship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.20'>And David said to his son Solomon, Be strong and of good courage, and do it; do not fear nor be dismayed, for Jehovah God, my God, will be with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you, until you have finished all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.21'>Behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and every willing man of wisdom will be with you for all manner of workmanship, for every kind of service; also the rulers and all the people are here for whatever you say.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Chr.29'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.1'>Furthermore King David said to all the assembly: My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and tender; and the work is great, because the temple is not for man but for Jehovah God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.2'>Now for the house of my God I have prepared with all my might: gold for things to be made of gold, silver for things of silver, bronze for things of bronze, iron for things of iron, wood for things of wood, onyx stones, stones to be set, antimony and of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and alabaster stones in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.3'>Moreover, because of my determination regarding the house of my God, I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the house of the sanctuary, from my own possessions of gold and silver:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.4'>three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.5'>the gold for things of gold and the silver for things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be done by the hands of craftsmen. Who then is willing to consecrate his hand this day unto Jehovah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.6'>Then the heads of the fathers, chiefs of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with the officers over the kings business, offered free-will offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.7'>They gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.8'>And those with whom precious stones were found, gave them to the treasury of the house of Jehovah, into the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.9'>And the people rejoiced, for they had offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they had offered willingly unto Jehovah; and King David also rejoiced with great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.10'>And David blessed Jehovah before the eyes of all the assembly, and David said: Blessed are You, Jehovah the God of Israel, our Father, forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.11'>Yours, O Jehovah, is the greatness, the power and the glory, the victory and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and on earth is Yours; Yours is the kingdom, O Jehovah, and You are exalted as head over all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.12'>Both riches and honor come from before You, and You reign over all. In Your hand is power and might; it is in Your hand to make great and to give strength to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.13'>Now therefore, our God, we are giving thanks to You and praising Your glorious name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.14'>But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things are from You, and out of Your own hand we have given to You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.15'>For we are strangers and sojourners before You, as were all our fathers; our days on earth are as a shadow, and there is no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.16'>O Jehovah our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build You a house for Your holy name is out of Your hand, and is all Your own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.17'>I know also, my God, that You examine the heart and take pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things; and now with joy I have seen Your people who are found here, to offer willingly to You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.18'>O Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the intent of the thoughts of the heart of Your people, and fix their heart toward You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.19'>And give my son Solomon a perfect heart to keep Your commandments and Your testimonies and Your statutes, to do all these things, and to build the temple for which I have made provision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.20'>And David said to all the assembly, Now bless Jehovah your God. So all the assembly blessed Jehovah the God of their fathers, and bowed down and prostrated themselves before Jehovah and the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.21'>And they slaughtered sacrifices unto Jehovah and offered burnt offerings unto Jehovah on the next day: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.22'>And they ate and drank before Jehovah with great gladness that day. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him before Jehovah as the prince, and Zadok as priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.23'>And Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.24'>All the rulers and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, set themselves under the hand of King Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.25'>Thus Jehovah highly magnified Solomon in the eyes of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.26'>Thus David the son of Jesse had reigned over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.27'>And the days that he reigned over Israel were forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.28'>And he died in a good old age, satisfied with days, riches and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.29'>Now the acts of King David, first and last, behold they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.30'>of all his reign and his might, and the events that happened to him, to Israel, and to all the kingdoms of the lands.</verse>
