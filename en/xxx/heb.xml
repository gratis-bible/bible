      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>God, Who at various times and in various ways spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, Whom He has appointed heir of all things, through Whom also He made the worlds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>Who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His essence, and upholding all things by the Word of His power, when He had by Himself made purification for our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>having become so much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the angels did He ever say: You are My Son, today I have begotten You? And again: I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>And again, when He brings the Firstborn into the world, He says: Let all the angels of God do homage to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>And of the angels He says: Who makes His angels spirits and His ministers a flame of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>But to the Son He says: Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; a scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your Kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness, beside Your companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And: You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They will be destroyed, but You remain; and they will all grow old like a garment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>like a cloak You will fold them up, and they will be changed. But You are the same, and Your years will not fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>But to which of the angels has He ever said: Sit at My right hand, till I place Your enemies as Your footstool?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who are about to inherit salvation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>Therefore we need to more abundantly heed the things we have heard, so that they do not slip our minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders, with various works of power, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For He has not put the world to come, of which we speak, in subjection to angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>But one testified in a certain place, saying: What is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You look upon him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>You have made him, for a little while, less than the angels; You have crowned him with glory and honor, and set him over the works of Your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that He put all things in subjection under him, He left nothing that is not put under him. But at this time we do not yet see all things subjected under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>But we see Jesus, who was made a little less than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, might taste death for everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Author of their salvation complete through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all of one, for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>saying: I will declare Your name to My brethren; in the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again: I will put My trust in Him. And again: Here am I and the children whom God has given Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and set free those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For indeed He does not take on the form of angels, but He does take on the seed of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in the things pertaining to God, in order to make propitiation for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>For in that He Himself has suffered, being tested, He is able to help those who are tested.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the Heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was faithful in all His house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>For this One has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as He who built the house has more honor than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>And Moses indeed was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which would be spoken later,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>but Christ as a Son over His own house, whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: Today, if you will hear His voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>do not harden your hearts as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>where your fathers tested Me, proved Me, and saw My works forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>Therefore I was angry with that generation, and said, They always go astray in their heart, and they have not known My ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>So I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Beware, brethren, that there not be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in withdrawing from the living God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>but exhort one another daily, while it is called Today, that not any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold fast to the origin of our Foundation steadfast to the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>while it is said: Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the provocation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>For some who came out of Egypt through Moses, however not all, having heard, provoked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>Now with whom was He angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who did not obey?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear so that none of you should show evidence of falling short.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>For we who believe do enter into rest, as He has said: So I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest, although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: And God rested on the seventh day from all His works;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>and again in this place: They shall not enter My rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Since therefore it remains for some to enter into it, and those to whom the gospel was first preached did not enter in because of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>again He designates a certain day, saying in David, Today, after such a long time, as it has been said: Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>There remains therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For he who has entered into His rest has himself also rested from his works as God did from His.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest, that no one fall according to the same example of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the Word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>And there is no creature that is not revealed in His presence, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we must give answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest taken from among men is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>He can have compassion on those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is also encompassed by weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>Because of this he is required as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifices for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called by God, just as Aaron was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but it was He who said to Him: You are My Son, today I have begotten You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>As He also says in another place: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>who, in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications, with vehement cries and tears to Him who had the power to save Him from death, and was heard because of His godly fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>And having been found perfect, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>called by God, High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>of whom we have much to say, and hard to explain with words, since you have become dull of hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the rudimentary principles of the Words of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>For everyone who partakes only of milk is without experience in the Word of Righteousness, for he is an infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their understanding exercised to discern both good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Therefore, leaving the discussion of the rudiments concerning Christ, let us move along to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>of the doctrine of immersion, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And this we will do if God permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossible for those who at one time were given understanding, and have tasted the Heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and have tasted the good Word of God and the powers of the age to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and also turn aside, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and expose Him to public disgrace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For the earth which drinks in the rain that often comes upon it, and bears herbs useful for those by whom it is cultivated, receives blessing from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>but if it bears thorns and briars, it is unfit and near to being cursed; its end is to be burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But, beloved, we are confident of better things concerning you, indeed, holding fast to salvation, though we speak in this manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not unjust, to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>that you do not become slothful, but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when God made a promise to Abraham, because He had no one greater to swear by, He swore by Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>saying, Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For men indeed swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is for them an end of all dispute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>Thus God, determining to show more abundantly to the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel, pledged it by an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters in within the veil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where the forerunner has entered for us, even Jesus, having become High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being translated king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, meaning king of peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And indeed those who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to receive tithes from the people according to the Law, that is, from their brethren, though they have come from the loins of Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>but he whose genealogy is not derived from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>And without any contradiction the inferior is blessed by the better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>Here mortal men receive tithes, but there it is witnessed that he lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>Even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, so to speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>Therefore, if perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the Law), what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be called according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there is also a change of the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For He of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no man has attended at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is evident that our Lord arose from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And it is yet far more evident if, in the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For He testifies: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>For there is indeed an annulling of the former commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>For the Law made nothing perfect, but a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And inasmuch as not without an oath</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>(for they have become priests without an oath, but He with an oath by Him who said to Him: The Lord has sworn and will not repent, You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>by so much Jesus has become a surety of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He lives forever to make intercession for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For such a High Priest was fitting for us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>who does not need, as the high priests, to offer up daily sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the people; for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the Law appoints as high priests men who have infirmity, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints the Son who has been perfected forever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Now this is the main point of the things being said: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this One also have something to offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the Law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>who serve the copy and shadow of the Heavenly things, as Moses was divinely admonished when he was about to make the tabernacle. For He said, See that you make all things according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if that first had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>Because finding fault with them, He says: Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant, and bring fulfillment to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they did not continue in My covenant, and I did not regard them, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will give My Laws into their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And they shall not each one teach his neighbor, and each one his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for every one shall know Me, from the least of them to their great ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawless deeds I will by no means remember any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>In that He says, New, He has made the first old. Now what is becoming worn out and growing old is ready to disappear.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>Then indeed, even the first covenant had ordinances of service and the earthly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For the first tabernacle was prepared: in which was the lampstand, the table, and the Bread of Presentation, which is called the sanctuary;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>and behind the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>which had the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna, Aarons staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Now when these things had been thus prepared, the priests always went into the first tabernacle, performing the services.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>But into the second the high priest went alone once a year, not without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins of the people, committed in ignorance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>the Holy Spirit signifying by this that the way into the Holy of Holies was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>It was a comparison for the present time in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make him who performed the service perfect in regard to the conscience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>concerned only with foods and drinks, various washings, and fleshly ordinances imposed until the time when things were set right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But Christ came as High Priest of the good things to come, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Holy of Holies once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies for the purifying of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And for this reason He is the Mediator of the new covenant, by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, that those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where there is a covenant, it is a necessity to announce the death of the one making the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For a covenant is in force after men are dead, since it has no power at all while the one who made the covenant is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Therefore neither was the first covenant dedicated without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>Then likewise he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>And according to the Law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>Therefore it was necessary that the copies of the things in the heavens should be purified with these, but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true, but into Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>not that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the Holy of Holies every year with blood of others;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>He then would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now, once for all, at the end of the ages, He has been manifested to put away sin through the sacrifice of Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this the judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, without sin, unto salvation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For the Law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of those things, can never with these same sacrifices, which they offer continually year by year, make those who approach perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>For then, would they not have ceased to be offered? For those serving, once purified, would have had no more consciousness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>Therefore, when He came into the world, He said: Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>You did not take pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then I said, Behold, I have come (in the volume of the book it is written of Me) to do Your will, O God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>Previously saying, Sacrifice and offering, burnt offerings, and offerings for sin You did not desire, nor were pleased with them (which are offered according to the Law),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>then He said, Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God. He takes away the first in order that He may establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And every priest stands ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>from that time onward waiting till His enemies are made His footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My Laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>then He adds, Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Therefore, brethren, having boldness to enter the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>by a new and living way which He consecrated for us, through the veil; that is, His flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and having a High Priest over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>Let us hold fast the confession of the hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting; and so much the more as you see the Day drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we sin willfully after we have received the full true knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery indignation which will devour those who oppose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>Anyone who rejected Moses Law dies without mercy before two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled on the Son of God, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of Grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>For we know Him who has said, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord. And again, The Lord will judge His people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>But remember the former days in which, after you were given understanding, you endured a great struggle with afflictions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>indeed while you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions, and also while you became companions of those who were so treated;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>for you had compassion on me in my bonds, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your goods, knowing, yourselves, that you have a better and an enduring possession in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>For yet a little while, and He who is coming will come and will not linger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>Now the just shall live by faith; but if anyone draws back, My soul is not pleased with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'>But we are not of those who draw back to destruction, but of those who believe to the preserving of the soul.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.11'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Now faith is the certainty of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>For by it the elders bore witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>By faith we understand that the universe was prepared by the Word of God, so that the things which are seen did not come into existence from things which are visible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>By faith Enoch was translated so that he did not see death, and was not found, because God had translated him; for before he was translated he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not understanding where he was going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'>for he waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'>By faith Sarah herself also received strength to conceive seed, and she bore a child when she was past the age, because she judged Him faithful who had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'>Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born as many as the stars of the sky in multitude; innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.13'>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off were assured of them, embraced them and confessed that they were foreigners and pilgrims on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'>For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.15'>And truly if they had called to mind that place from which they had come out, they would have had opportunity to return.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.25'>choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the temporary pleasures of sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.26'>esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the recompense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.27'>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.28'>By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn should not touch them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.34'>quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became mighty in battle, turned to flight the armies of foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.35'>Women received their dead raised to life again. And others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.37'>They were stoned, they were sawn in two, were tried, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, oppressed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.38'>of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, in dens and caves of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.39'>And all these, having borne witness through faith, did not obtain the promise,</verse>
