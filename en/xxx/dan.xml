  <div osisID='Dan' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.1'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.1'>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.2'>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim, king of Judah, into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god. And he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.3'>And the king spoke to Ashpenaz, the chief of his officials that he should bring some of the sons of Israel, and of the kings seed, and of the nobles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.4'>young men in whom was no blemish, but who were of good appearance and having understanding in all wisdom, having knowledge and understanding science, even those with ability in them to stand in the kings palace; to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.5'>And the king appointed for them a daily portion every day, from the kings food, and of the wine which he drank, even to raise them three years, so that at the end of that time they might stand before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.6'>And there were among those of the sons of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.7'>to whom the chief of the officials gave names. For he called Daniel, Belteshazzar; and Hananiah, Shadrach; and Mishael, Meshach; and Azariah, Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.8'>And Daniel determined in his heart that he would not defile himself with the kings food, or with the wine which he drank. So he asked of the chief of the officials that he might not defile himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.9'>Now God had brought Daniel into kindness and compassion with the chief of the officials.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.10'>And the chief of the officials said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink. For why should he see your faces looking worse than the other boys who are your age? Then you would endanger my head before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.11'>And Daniel said to Melzar, whom the chief of the officials had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.12'>Please, test your servants ten days, and let us be given vegetables to eat, and water to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.13'>Then let our appearance be examined before you, and the appearance of the boys who eat of the kings food; and as you see fit, do so with your servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.14'>And he consented to them in this matter and tested them ten days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.15'>And at the end of ten days their appearance looked better and fatter of flesh than all the boys who were eating the kings food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.16'>So Melzar took away their food and the wine that they were to drink, and he gave them vegetables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.17'>As for these four boys, God gave them knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom. And Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.18'>And at the end of the days that the king had said that they should be brought in, the chief of the officials brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.19'>And the king talked with them. And among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they served before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.20'>And in any matter of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them, he found them to be ten times better than all the magicians and conjurers who were in all his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.21'>And Daniel continued to the first year of King Cyrus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.2'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.1'>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar was dreaming dreams, and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.2'>And the king commanded to call the magicians, and the conjurers, and the sorcerers and the Chaldeans, to declare to the king his dreams. And they came and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.3'>And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.4'>And the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic: O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will explain the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.5'>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The command is gone from me. If you will not make known the dream and its interpretation to me, you will be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made an outhouse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.6'>But if you declare the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive gifts and rewards and great honor from me. Therefore, declare the dream and its interpretation to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.7'>They again replied and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will explain its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.8'>The king answered and said, I know that you would buy time, because you see that the command is gone from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.9'>But if you will not make the dream known to me, there is one law for you. For you have agreed upon lying and deceiving words to speak before me until the time has changed. Therefore, tell me the dream, then I shall know that you have the ability to explain the interpretation to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.10'>The Chaldeans replied before the king and said, There is not a man on the earth who can declare the kings matter, because not any king, lord, or ruler has asked such a thing from any magician, or conjurer, or Chaldean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.11'>And the thing that the king asks is rare. And there is no other who can declare it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.12'>Because of all this the king was enraged and angered. And he commanded all the wise men of Babylon to be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.13'>And the law went out that the wise men should be killed. And they searched for Daniel and his companions, to be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.14'>Then Daniel answered with counsel and discretion to Arioch the chief of the kings guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.15'>He answered and said to Arioch, the kings officer, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? And Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.16'>And Daniel went in and asked of the king that he would give him time, and he would declare to the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.17'>Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.18'>that they might pray for the mercies of God in Heaven concerning this secret, that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.19'>Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a night vision, and Daniel blessed the God of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.20'>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, for wisdom and might are His.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.21'>And He changes the times and the seasons; He removes kings, and sets up kings; He gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to those who have understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.22'>He reveals the deep and secret things; He knows what is in the darkness, and light dwells in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.23'>I thank You and praise You, O God of my fathers, who has given me wisdom and might, and has made known to me what we asked of You. For You have made known to us the kings matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.24'>Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said this to him, Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me before the king, and I will declare the interpretation to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.25'>Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and spoke this to him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah who will make the interpretation known to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.26'>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.27'>Daniel replied before the king and said, The secret which the king has demanded cannot be declared to the king by the wise men, the conjurers, the magicians, or the fortunetellers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.28'>But there is a God in Heaven who reveals secrets, and makes known to King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.29'>As for you, O king, thoughts came to you on your bed, about what should come to pass after this. And He who reveals secrets makes known to you what shall come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.30'>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living man, but in order that the interpretation might be made known to the king, and that you might know the thoughts of your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.31'>You, O king, were watching, and behold, a certain great image! This great image stood before you with extraordinary brightness, and its form was dreadful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.32'>The head of this image was of fine gold, its chest and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.33'>its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.34'>You watched until it happened that a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.35'>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were together broken to pieces, and they became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors. And the wind carried them away so that they could not be found anywhere. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.36'>This is the dream. Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.37'>You O king are a king of kings. For the God of Heaven has given you a kingdom, power, and strength, and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.38'>And wherever the sons of men, the animals of the field, and the birds of the sky dwell, He has given them into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all. You are this head of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.39'>And in your place shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours, and another third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.40'>And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron. Inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters all things, and like iron that crushes all these, it will break in pieces and crush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.41'>And whereas you saw the feet and the toes, partly of potters clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided. But there shall be in it the strength of iron, just as you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.42'>And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.43'>And as you saw the iron mixed with the miry clay, they shall become mixed with the seed of men. But they shall not cleave to one another, even as iron does not fellowship with clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.44'>And in the days of these kings, the God of Heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be left to other people. It shall break in pieces and bring all these kingdoms to an end, and it shall stand forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.45'>Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold in pieces, the Great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass after this. And the dream is certain, and the interpretation of it is sure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.46'>Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face prostrate before Daniel. And he commanded that they present an offering to him with incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.47'>The king answered Daniel and said, Your God truly is a God of gods and a Lord of kings, and a Revealer of secrets, since you could reveal this secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.48'>Then the king made Daniel great and gave him many great gifts. And he made him ruler over all the province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.49'>And Daniel petitioned the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon. But Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.3'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was sixty cubits; its breadth, six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.2'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges and the justices, and all the officials of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.3'>Then were gathered the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the justices, and all the officials of the provinces, to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. And they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.4'>Then the herald cried with strength: To you it is commanded O peoples, nations, and languages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.5'>that at the time you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, you shall fall down and prostrate yourselves before the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.6'>And whoever does not fall down and prostrate themselves, at that moment they will be thrown into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.7'>So at that time when all the people heard the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and languages fell down, prostrating themselves before the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.8'>Then at that time certain Chaldeans approached and accused the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.9'>They spoke and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live forever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.10'>You, O king, have made a decree that every man who shall hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and the bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and prostrate himself before the golden image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.11'>And whoever does not fall down and prostrate himself, he should be thrown into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.12'>There are certain Jews whom you have set over the administration of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, do not give due regard to you. They do not serve your gods nor prostrate themselves before the golden image which you have set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.13'>Then Nebuchadnezzar in anger and wrath commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.14'>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that you do not serve my gods, nor prostrate yourselves before the golden image which I have set up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.15'>Now if you are ready, at the time you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, fall down and prostrate yourselves before the image which I have made. But if you do not prostrate yourselves, in that moment you shall be thrown into the middle of a burning fiery furnace. And who is that god who shall deliver you out of my hand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.16'>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.17'>If it is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.18'>But even if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods nor prostrate ourselves before the golden image which you have set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.19'>Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath, and the form of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He spoke and commanded that they heat the furnace seven times more than it was usual to heat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.20'>And he commanded mighty men of valor from his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to throw them into the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.21'>Then these men were tied up in their coats, their tunics, and their turbans, and their other clothes, and were thrown into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.22'>Therefore also, because the kings command was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.23'>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.24'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was startled. And he rose up in haste; he spoke and said to his counselors, Did we not throw three men bound into the middle of the fire? They replied and said to the king, True, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.25'>He answered and said, Behold! I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and there is no harm to them. And the form of the fourth is like the son of a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.26'>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace. He answered and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the middle of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.27'>And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the kings counselors gathered around. And they saw these men on whose bodies the fire had no power, and the hair of their head was not scorched, nor were their coats changed, nor was there any smell of fire on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.28'>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent His Angel and has delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and have changed the kings words, and have given their bodies that they might not serve nor prostrate themselves before any god except their own God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.29'>Therefore I make a decree; that every people, nation, and language who speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut into pieces and his house shall be made into an outhouse; because there is no other god who is able to deliver like this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.30'>Then the king made Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego prosper in the province of Babylon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.4'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples, nations, and tongues that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.2'>It seemed good for me to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.3'>How great are His signs! And how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and His dominion is from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.4'>I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house, and flourishing in my palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.5'>I saw a dream which terrified me, and the thoughts on my bed and visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.6'>So I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.7'>Then the magicians, the conjurers, the Chaldeans, and the fortunetellers came in. And I told the dream before them, but they could not make its interpretation known to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.8'>But at last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. And I told the dream before him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.9'>O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.10'>As for the visions of my head on my bed, I was looking, and, behold, a tree was in the middle of the earth. And its height was great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.11'>The tree became great and strong, and its height reached to the heavens, and it was visible to the ends of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.12'>Its leaves were beautiful, and its fruit plentiful, and food for all was in it. The beasts of the field sought shade under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.13'>I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a watcher, even a holy one, came down from the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.14'>He cried with might and said this: Cut down the tree and cut off its branches. Shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts flee from under it, and the birds from its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.15'>Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the grass of the field. And let it be wet with the dew of the heavens, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.16'>Let his heart be changed from that of a man, and let him be given the heart of a beast. And let seven times pass over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.17'>This sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the command by the word of the holy ones, in order that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever He wills, and sets up over it the lowest of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.18'>I, Nebuchadnezzar, have seen this dream. Now you, O Belteshazzar, declare its interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known the interpretation to me. But you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.19'>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stunned for a time, and his thoughts troubled him. So the king spoke and said, O Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation trouble you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, may the dream be to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your enemies!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.20'>The tree that you saw, which became great and strong, whose height reached to the heavens and was visible to all the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.21'>and its leaves being beautiful, and its fruit plentiful, and food for all being in it, under which the beasts of the field lived, and in its branches the birds of the heavens had their home:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.22'>It is you, O king, for you have become great and strong; for your greatness has grown and reaches to the heavens, and your dominion to the ends of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.23'>And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from the heavens, and saying, Cut the tree down, and destroy it. Yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the grass of the field. And let him be wet with the dew of the heavens, and his portion with the beasts of the field, until seven times pass over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.24'>This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.25'>And you shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. And you shall be fed with grass like oxen. And you shall be wet with dew of the heavens; and seven times shall pass over you until you know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of men, and He gives it to whomever He desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.26'>And whereas they commanded to leave the stump and roots of the tree: Your kingdom shall be secure to you after you have come to know that Heaven rules.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.27'>Therefore, O king, let my advice be acceptable to you: Even break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; so that perhaps there may be a lengthening of your prosperity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.28'>All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.29'>At the end of twelve months, he was walking in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.30'>The king spoke and said, Is this not great Babylon that I have built for the house of the kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.31'>While the word was still in the kings mouth a voice fell from the heavens, saying, O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared: The kingdom has been taken away from you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.32'>And you shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You shall be fed with grass like oxen, and seven times shall pass over you until you know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of men, and that He gives it to whomever He desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.33'>That very hour the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar. And he was driven from men, and he ate grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the heavens, until his hair had grown like eagles feathers, and his nails like birds claws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.34'>And at the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to the heavens, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High. And I praised and honored Him who lives forever, whose dominion is an eternal dominion, and His rule from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.35'>And all those living in the earth are counted as nothing. And He does according to His will in the army of Heaven, and among those living in the earth. And no one is able to restrain His hand or say to Him, What are You doing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.36'>At that time my reason returned to me, and the glory of my kingdom, my majesty, and my splendor returned to me. And my counselors and my nobles sought to me. And I was reestablished in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.37'>Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor the King of Heaven, for all His works are truth, and His ways are justice. And He is able to humble those who walk in pride.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.5.1'>Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his nobles. And he drank wine before the thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.2'>While tasting the wine, Belshazzar commanded the golden and silver vessels to be brought, those his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem, that the king and his nobles, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.3'>Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God in Jerusalem. And the king, his nobles, his wives, and his concubines drank from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.4'>They drank wine and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, and of bronze, of iron, wood, and stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.5'>At that moment fingers of a mans hand came out and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the kings palace across from the lampstand. And the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.6'>Then the kings countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins shook, and his knees knocked one against the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.7'>The king cried aloud to bring in the conjurers, the Chaldeans, and the fortunetellers. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever can read this writing and explain its interpretation shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold around his neck.

        <verse osisID='Dan.5.8'>Then all the kings wise men came in. But they could not read the writing or make the interpretation known to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.9'>Then King Belshazzar was greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed, and his nobles were perplexed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.10'>The queen came into the banquet house because of the words of the king and his nobles. The queen spoke and said, O king, live forever. Do not let your thoughts terrify you, and do not let your countenance be changed.</verse>

And in the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom were found in him, like the wisdom of the gods. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, your father the king, appointed him master of the magicians, conjurers, Chaldeans and fortunetellers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.12'>because an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and declaring riddles, and the solving of problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will give the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.13'>Then Daniel was thrust in before the king. And the king spoke and said to Daniel, Are you that Daniel who is of the sons of the captives of Judah, whom my father the king brought out of Judah?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.5.18'>O king, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.19'>And for the majesty that He gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. He killed whom he desired, and whom he desired he kept alive. And whom he would, he set up; and whom he desired, he put down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.20'>But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom, and they took his glory from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.21'>And he was driven from the sons of men. And his heart was made like the animals, and his home was with the wild asses. They fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the heavens, until he knew that the Most High God is Ruler in the kingdom of men, and that He appoints over it whomever He desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.22'>And you, his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.23'>But you have lifted yourself up against the Lord of Heaven. And they have brought the vessels of His house before you. And you, and your nobles, your wives, and your concubines have drunk wine from them. And you have praised the gods of silver, and gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see, nor hear, and do not know. And you have not glorified the God in whose hand your life, breath, and all your ways is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.24'>Then the part of the hand was sent from Him, and this writing was written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.25'>And this is the writing that was written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.6.1'>It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, that they might be over the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.2'>And over them were three presidents, of whom Daniel was one, so that the satraps might give account to them, and that the king should have no loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.3'>Then this Daniel distinguished himself above the presidents and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him. And the king was thinking to set him over all the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.4'>Then the presidents and satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom. But they could find no occasion or fault because he was trustworthy. And no error or fault was found in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.5'>Then these men said, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel unless we find it against him concerning the Law of his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.6'>Then these presidents and satraps gathered together to the king and said this to him, King Darius, live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.7'>All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects, and the satraps, the officials and the governors, have planned together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except from you, O king, shall be thrown into the den of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.8'>Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the document, so that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.9'>So, King Darius signed the document and the decree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.10'>And when he had learned that the document was signed, Daniel went to his house. And in his roof room, with his windows open toward Jerusalem, he knelt on his knees three times a day, and prayed and praised before his God, as he did before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.11'>Then these men conspired together and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.12'>Then they came near and spoke before the king concerning the kings decree, saying, Have you not signed a decree that every man who shall ask of any god or man within thirty days, except of you, O king, that he shall be thrown into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is certain, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.13'>Then they answered and said before the king, Daniel, who is of the sons of the captives from Judah, does not show due regard to you, O king, or the decree that you have signed, but he makes his petition three times a day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.14'>Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased with himself, and he set his heart on Daniel, to deliver him. And he labored until the going down of the sun to deliver him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.15'>Then these men met before the king and said to the king, O king, know that the law of the Medes and Persians is that no decree or law which the king establishes may be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.16'>And the king commanded. And they brought Daniel, and they threw him into the den of lions. The king spoke and said to Daniel, Your God whom you serve continually will deliver you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.17'>And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den. And the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his nobles, that the matter concerning Daniel might not be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.18'>Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.19'>Then the king rose up at dawn, at daybreak, and hurried to the den of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.20'>And when he came to the den, he cried with a grieving voice to Daniel. The king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, your God whom you always serve, is He able to deliver you from the lions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.21'>Then Daniel said to the king, O king, live forever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.22'>My God has sent His Angel, and He has shut the mouths of the lions. And they have not harmed me, because in His sight innocence was found in me. And also before you, O king, I have done no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.23'>Then the king was exceedingly glad over him. And he commanded to bring up Daniel from the den. And Daniel was brought out of the den, and no harm was found on him, because he trusted in his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.24'>And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel. And they threw them into the den of lions, them, their sons and their wives. And the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones before they ever reached the bottom of the den.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.25'>Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, the nations, and the languages who were living in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.26'>I make a decree, that in every domain of my kingdom there shall be trembling and fear before the God of Daniel. For He is the living God and endures forever, and His kingdom is the one which shall not be destroyed. And His rule shall be to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.27'>He delivers and rescues, and He works signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth, He who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.28'>So this Daniel was made to prosper in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.7'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.1'>In the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream, telling the main points.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.2'>Daniel spoke and said, In my vision by night I was looking. And, behold, the four winds of the heavens were stirring up the Great Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.3'>And four great beasts came up from the sea, different from one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.4'>The first was like a lion and had eagles wings. I watched until its wings were plucked off. And it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man, and a mans heart was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.5'>And, behold, another beast, a second, like a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. And they said this to it, Rise up, devour much flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.6'>After this I was looking, and, behold, another like a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird on its back. And also the beast had four heads. And dominion was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.7'>And after this I was looking in the night visions. And, behold, the fourth beast was frightening and terrifying, and very strong! And it had great iron teeth. It devoured, and broke in pieces, and stamped what was left with its feet. And it was different from all the beasts before it; and it had ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.8'>I was contemplating the horns. And behold, another little horn came up among them, and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.9'>I watched until the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of Days sat, whose robe was white as snow and the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was like flames of fire, its wheels like burning fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.10'>A stream of fire went out and came out from before Him. A thousand thousands served Him, and a vast innumerable number stood before Him. The judgment was set and the books were opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.11'>Then I was watching because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke. I was watching until the beast was killed, and his body was destroyed and given to the burning flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.12'>As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away. Yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.13'>I saw in the night visions. And behold, one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of the heavens. And He came to the Ancient of Days. And they brought Him near before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.14'>And dominion was given to Him, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.15'>I, Daniel, was distressed in my spirit within my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.16'>And I came near one of those who stood by and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me and made me know the interpretation of the things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.17'>These great beasts which are four, are four kings which shall rise up out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.18'>But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.19'>Then I wanted to know the truth of the fourth beast, which was different from all of the others, very frightening, with its teeth of iron and its nails of bronze; which devoured and broke in pieces, and trampled what was left with its feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.20'>also of the ten horns that were on its head, and the other which came up, and before whom three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, whose appearance was greater than his fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.21'>I was watching, and the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.22'>until the Ancient of Days came. And judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.23'>And he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all other kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall trample it down and break it in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.24'>And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings; they shall rise, and another shall rise after them. And he shall be different from the first, and he shall abase three kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.25'>And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall continually harass the saints of the Most High. And he shall intend to change times and law. And they shall be given into his hand for a period of a time and times and one half time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.26'>But the court shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy until the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.27'>And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heavens shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. And all dominions shall serve and obey Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.28'>Thus far is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts terrified me much, and my countenance changed in me. But I kept the matter in my heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.8'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.1'>In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me the first time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.2'>And I saw in the vision, and it happened when I looked that I was at Shushan, the palace, which is in the province of Elam. And in the vision I saw that I was by the Ulai River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.3'>Then I lifted up my eyes and looked. And behold, a ram was standing before the river, having horns. And the horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.4'>I saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward, so that no beasts could stand before him, and no one could deliver out of his hand. But he did according to his will and became great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.5'>And as I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west, over the face of the whole earth and did not touch the ground. And the he goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.6'>And he came to the ram with the horns which I had seen standing before the river, and ran at him with furious power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.7'>And I saw him come close to the ram. And he was enraged against him. And he struck the ram and broke his two horns. And there was no power in the ram to stand before him. But he threw him down to the ground and trampled him. And there was no one that could deliver the ram from his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.8'>Then the male goat became very great. And when he became strong, the great horn was broken. And in its place came up four conspicuous ones toward the four winds of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.9'>And out of one of them came a little horn which became very great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beautiful land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.10'>And it became great, even to the host of the heavens. And it caused some of the host and of the stars to fall to the ground, and trampled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.11'>He magnified himself even to the Prince of the host. And the regular sacrifice was taken away by him, and the foundation of His sanctuary was cast down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.12'>And a host was assigned to him against the regular sacrifice because of transgression. And he cast truth down to the ground. He did all this and prospered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.13'>Then I heard a certain holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one who spoke, For how long is the vision, concerning the regular sacrifice and the transgression of desolation, to permit both the holy place and the host to be trampled?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.14'>And he said to me, For two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings; then the holy place will be put right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.15'>And it happened when I, Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought the understanding, that behold, one having the appearance of a man stood before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.16'>And I heard a mans voice between the banks of Ulai, and he called and said, Gabriel, make this one understand the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.17'>And he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was afraid and fell on my face. But he said to me, O son of man, understand that the vision is about the time of the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.18'>And while he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep with my face toward the ground. But he touched me, and stood me upright.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.19'>And he said, Behold, I will make you know what shall happen at the time of the end of the indignation. For at the appointed time the end will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.20'>The ram which you saw with two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.21'>And the male goat is the king of Greece. And the great horn between his eyes is the first king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.22'>And as for that which was broken, and four stood up in its place, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.23'>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king shall stand forth, having fierce countenance and understanding sinister schemes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.24'>And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power. And he shall destroy extraordinarily, and he shall prosper, and work, and destroy the mighty and the holy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.25'>And also through his cunning he will cause deceit to prosper in his hand. And he will magnify himself in his heart, and through prosperity shall destroy many. He shall also stand up against the Ruler of rulers, but he shall be broken in pieces without hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.26'>And the morning and evening vision that was told is true. But you shall close up the vision, for it is yet for many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.27'>And I, Daniel, fainted and was sick for days. Afterward, I got up and did the kings business. And I was astonished at the vision, but did not understand it.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.9'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.1'>In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.2'>in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood the number of the years by the books, from the Word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet, that He would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.3'>And I set my face toward the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.4'>And I prayed to Jehovah my God, and made my confession, saying, O Lord, the great and awesome Mighty God, keeping the covenant and mercy with those who love Him, and with those who keep His commandments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.5'>we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from Your commandments and from Your judgments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.6'>And we have not heeded Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our rulers, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.7'>O Lord, righteousness belongs to You, but to us the shame of face, as it is this day to the men of Judah, and to those living in Jerusalem, and to all Israel, who are near and who are afar in all the lands where You have driven them for their unfaithfulness which they have trespassed against You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.8'>O Lord, shame of face belongs to us, to our kings, to our rulers and to our fathers, because we have sinned against You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.9'>To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.10'>We have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in His laws which he set before us by His servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.11'>Yea, all Israel has transgressed Your Law and turned aside so as not to obey Your voice. For this reason the curse has poured out on us, and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.12'>And He has confirmed His Words which He spoke against us, and against our judges who judged us, by bringing on us a great evil. For under the whole heavens it has never been done as has been done to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.13'>As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this evil has come on us. Yet we did not make our prayer before Jehovah our God that we might turn from our depravities and understand Your truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.14'>And Jehovah has looked on the evil and has brought it upon us. For Jehovah our God is righteous in all His works which He does. For we did not obey His voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.15'>And now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and made for Yourself a name, as it is this day; we have sinned; we have done wickedly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.16'>O Lord, I pray, according to all Your righteousness, let Your anger and Your fury be turned away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain. For because of our sins and for our fathers iniquities, Jerusalem and Your people have become a reproach to all those around us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.17'>And now, hear, O our God, the prayer of Your servant and his supplications, and cause Your face to shine on Your sanctuary that is desolate, for the sake of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.18'>O my God, bow down Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and see our desolations and the city which is called by Your name. For we do not make our supplications before You on account of our righteousness, but because of Your great mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.19'>O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, give attention and act! Do not delay, for Your own sake, O my God. For Your city and Your people are called by Your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.20'>And while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and prostrating with my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.21'>and while I was speaking in prayer, then the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, reached me as I was weary and faint, about the time of the evening sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.22'>And he informed me and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you skill in understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.23'>At the beginning of your prayers the word came forth, and I have come to explain it. For you are greatly beloved. Therefore consider the matter and understand the vision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.24'>Seventy weeks are decreed regarding your people, and regarding your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make atonement for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Holy of Holies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.25'>Know, therefore, and understand that from the going forth of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem, to Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks and sixty two weeks. The street shall be built again, and the wall, even in times of distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.26'>And after sixty two weeks, Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself. And the people of a coming ruler shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end shall be with a flood, and desolations are determined, and there shall be war until the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.27'>And he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week. And in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the grain offering to cease. And on a corner will be abominations that cause horror, even until the end. And that which was decreed shall be poured out on the desolate.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.10'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.1'>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a word was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar. And the word was true, but the appointed time was long. And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.2'>In those days, I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.3'>I ate no pleasant food, and no flesh or wine came into my mouth. I did not anoint myself at all until three whole weeks were fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.4'>And in the twenty fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Tigris,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.5'>then I lifted up my eyes and looked: And behold, a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold from Uphaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.6'>His body was also like the beryl, and his face looked like lightning. And his eyes were like torches of fire; and his arms and his feet in color like polished bronze; and the sound of his words was like the sound of a multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.7'>And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision. For the men who were with me did not see the vision. But a great trembling fell on them so that they fled to hide themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.8'>Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me. For my glory was turned within me into corruption, and I had no strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.9'>Yet I heard the sound of his words. And when I heard the sound of his words, then I was on my face, in a deep sleep, and my face was toward the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.10'>And, behold, a hand touched me, which made me tremble in my knees and in the palms of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.11'>And he said to me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you and stand up, for I am now sent to you. And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood, trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.12'>And he said to me, Do not fear, Daniel. For from the first day that you set your heart to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. And I have come because of your words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.13'>But the ruler of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days. But, lo, Michael, one of the chief rulers, came to help me; for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.14'>Now I have come to make you understand what shall happen to your people in the latter days. For the vision is yet for many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.15'>And when he had spoken such words to me, I turned my face to the ground, and I became speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.16'>And, behold, one resembling the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who stood before me, O my lord, my distress has overwhelmed me because of the vision, and I have no strength left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.17'>For how can this servant of my lord speak with you my lord? For as for me, there is no strength left in me; nor is there breath left in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.18'>Then again, one resembling a man touched me and strengthened me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.19'>And he said, O man greatly beloved, do not fear. Peace to you. Be strong. Yea, be strong! And when he had spoken to me I was strengthened. And I said, Speak, my lord, for you have strengthened me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.20'>And he said, Do you know why I have come to you? And now I will return to fight with the ruler of Persia. And when I have gone out, then indeed, the ruler of Greece shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.21'>But I will tell you what is written in the Scripture of Truth. (And no one holds strong with me in these things, except Michael your ruler.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.11'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.1'>And I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood to strengthen and protect him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.2'>And now I will declare the truth to you: Behold, three more kings shall stand up in Persia; and the fourth shall be rich in all greater riches. And when he is strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.3'>And a mighty king shall stand up who shall rule with great authority and do according to his will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.4'>And when he stands up his kingdom shall be broken in pieces and shall be divided to the four winds of the heavens, and not to his posterity, nor according to his authority with which he ruled. For his kingdom shall be plucked up and given to others besides these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.5'>And the king of the south shall be strong. And one of his rulers, even he will gain strength over him, and he will rule. His dominion shall be a great dominion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.6'>And at the end of years they shall join together, and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement. But she shall not retain the power of the arm. And he will not stand, nor his arm. But she and those who brought her shall be given up, as well as the one who begot her and who supported her in these times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.7'>But out of the shoots of her roots one will stand in his place, and he shall come with an army and will enter into the fortress of the king of the north. And he will act against them and prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.8'>And he will also bring their gods with their cast images, along with their possessions of silver and gold vessels, into captivity to Egypt. And he will continue more years than the king of the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.9'>And the king of the south will come into his kingdom and will return to his own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.10'>But his sons shall be stirred up and shall gather a multitude of great forces. And one certainly shall come and overflow and pass through. And he will return to his fortress and be stirred up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.11'>And the king of the south will be bitter and will go out and fight with him, with the king of the north. And he shall raise a great multitude, but the multitude shall be given into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.12'>And when he has carried away the multitude, his heart will be lifted up. And he will cause a vast innumerable number to fall, but he will not prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.13'>For the king of the north shall return and raise a greater multitude than the former. And at the end of some years, he shall come to attack with a great army and with much equipment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.14'>And in those times many shall stand up against the king of the south. And the sons of the violent ones of your people shall rise up to fulfill the vision, but they shall stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.15'>So the king of the north shall come and build up a siege mound and seize a fortified city. And the forces of the south shall not stand, nor his choice people, for there will be no strength to resist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.16'>But he who comes against him will do as he desires, and no one shall stand before him. And he shall stand in the glorious land, with destruction in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.17'>And he shall set his face to go in with the might of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do. And he shall give the daughter of women to him, to destroy it. But she shall not stand, nor be for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.18'>After this he shall turn his face to the coastlands and shall capture many. But a ruler shall make his reproach cease for him, but his reproach shall return to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.19'>And he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall and not be found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.20'>Then one who imposes taxes shall stand in his place, in the glorious kingdom. But within a few days he will be broken in pieces, but not in anger nor in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.21'>And a vile person shall stand up in his place, and they shall not give to him the honor as king. But he shall come in with quietness and obtain the kingdom by intrigues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.22'>And with the forces of the overflow they shall be swept from before him, and be broken, and also the ruler of the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.23'>And after they join themselves to him, he will practice deceit; for he shall come and shall be strong with a few people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.24'>He will go in peaceably, even into the rich places of the province. And he shall do what his fathers have not done, nor his fathers fathers. He shall plunder and spoil and scatter goods among them. And he shall devise his plots against the strongholds, even for a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.25'>And he will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army. And the king of the south will be stirred up to battle with a great and very mighty army. But he shall not stand, for they will devise plots against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.26'>Yea, those who eat his food shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow. And many will fall down slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.27'>And both of these kings shall have it in their hearts to do evil, and they will speak lies at one table. But it will not prosper, for the end shall still be at the appointed time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.28'>And he will return to his land with great wealth. And his heart shall be against the holy covenant. And he will act, and he shall return to his own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.29'>At the appointed time he will return and come against the south. But it will not be as the former or as the latter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.30'>For ships from Kittim will come against him. And he will be grieved and return and be furious against the holy covenant. And he will act, and he will return and give heed to those who forsake the holy covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.31'>And forces will stand for him, and they will profane the sanctuary fortress. And they shall remove the regular sacrifice, and they will place there the abomination that causes horror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.32'>And he will corrupt with flatteries those who act wickedly against the covenant. But the people who know their God will be strong and will work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.33'>And those who understand among the people will instruct many. Yet they will stumble by the sword and by flame, by captivity and spoils for many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.34'>And when they shall stumble, they will be helped with a little help. But many will join them with hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.35'>And some of those who understand shall stumble, to refine and to purge them, and to make them white, unto the time of the end; for it is yet for the appointed time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.36'>And the king shall do according to his own will. And he shall exalt and magnify himself above every god; he shall even speak extraordinary things against the Mighty God of gods and shall prosper until the indignation is complete. For that which is decreed shall be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.37'>He shall not regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women; nor regard any god. For he shall magnify himself above them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.38'>But in his place he shall honor the god of fortresses, and he shall honor a god whom his fathers did not know, with gold and silver and with precious stones, and desirable things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.39'>And he shall act in the strongholds of the fortresses with a foreign god, whom he shall acknowledge. He shall multiply in glory, and he shall cause them to rule over many and shall divide the land for gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.40'>And at the time of the end, the king of the south will push against him. And the king of the north shall come against him like a tempest, with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships. And he shall go into the lands and shall overflow and pass through.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.41'>And he shall enter into the glorious land, and many will stumble. But these shall escape out of his hand: Edom and Moab, and the chief of the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.42'>He will stretch out his hand against the lands, and the land of Egypt shall not escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.43'>But he will rule over the treasures of gold and silver, and over all the desirable things of Egypt. And the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.44'>But news from the east and from the north shall trouble him. And he will go out with great fury to utterly destroy and annihilate many.</verse>
