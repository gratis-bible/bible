      <chapter osisID='Gen.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>And the earth was without form, and void, with darkness on the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>Then God said, Let there be light! And there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided between the light and darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>God called the light, Day; and the darkness He called, Night. Thus, the evening and the morning: Day One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>Then God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, separating the waters from the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>And God made the firmament, and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>And God called the firmament, Heavens. Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>Then God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear: thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters He called, Seas. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>And God said, Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and the fruit tree producing fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth: thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to its kind, and the tree producing fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>Then God said, Let there be luminaries in the firmament of the heavens, to distinguish the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>and let them be for luminaries in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth: thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>And God made two great luminaries: the greater luminary to rule the day, and the lesser luminary to rule the night, and also the stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to shine upon the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>and to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>Then God said, Let the waters swarm with swarming living creatures, and let flying creatures fly to and fro above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>So God created great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, that swarmed in the waters according to their kind, and every winged flying creature according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the flying creatures multiply on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Five.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>Then God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: beasts, creeping things and living things of the earth, each according to its kind: thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'>And God made the living things of the earth according to its kind, beasts according to its kind, and everything that creeps on the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>Then God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the flying creatures of the heavens, and over the beasts, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that moves on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'>So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'>And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the flying creatures of the heavens, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>And God said, Behold, I have given you every plant that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>Also, to every living thing of the earth, to every flying creature of the heavens, and to everything that moves on the earth, living creatures, I have given the green plants for food: thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'>And God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was extremely good. Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Six.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>And on the seventh day God completed His work which He had made, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>And God blessed the seventh day and consecrated it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God was making the earth and the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>before any shrub of the field was on the earth and before any green plant of the field had sprouted; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>And out of the ground Jehovah God made to sprout every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The Tree of Life was also in the midst of the garden, and also the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one which circles around all the land of Havilah, where there is gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium and the onyx stone are there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one which circles around all the land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>The name of the third river is Tigris; it is the one going toward the east of Assyria. The fourth river is Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>Then Jehovah God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may eat to feed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>And Jehovah God said, It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper to complement him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>Out of the ground Jehovah God formed every living thing of the field and every flying creature of the heavens, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>So the man gave names to all the animals, to the flying creatures of the heavens, and to every living thing of the field. But for the man there was not found a helper to complement him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>And the rib which Jehovah God had taken out of the man He rebuilt into a woman, and He brought her to the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>And the man said: This now at last is bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>Therefore a man, leaving his father and mother, and having cleaved to his wife, they are one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>Now the serpent was more cunning than any living thing of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said to the woman, Has God indeed said, You shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not die the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be as God, knowing good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>And they heard the sound of Jehovah God walking around in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God among the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>And Jehovah God called to the man and said to him, Where are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>And he said, I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>And He said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>And the man said, The woman whom You gave to be with me, she has given to me of the tree, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>And Jehovah God said to the woman, What is this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>So Jehovah God said to the serpent: Because you have done this, you are cursed more than all beasts, and more than every living thing of the field; on your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>To the woman He said: I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in pain you shall bring forth children; your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>And to Adam He said, Because you have heeded the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: Cursed is the ground for your sake; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, and you shall eat the plants of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you have been taken; for dust you are, and to dust you shall return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>And the man called his wifes name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>Also for the man and his wife Jehovah God made tunics of skins, and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man has become as one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, that he not put forth his hand and take also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>therefore Jehovah God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>So He drove out the man; and He placed cherubim at the east of the Garden of Eden, and a flaming sword turning this way and that, to guard the way to the Tree of Life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, I have acquired a man from Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>And she bore again, his brother Abel. And Abel tended flocks, but Cain worked the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>And at the end of so many days it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground unto Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And Jehovah had regard for Abel and his offering,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>but He did not have regard for Cain and his offering. And Cains anger burned greatly, and his countenance fell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>So Jehovah said to Cain, Why does your anger burn? And why has your countenance fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>If you do well, is there not exaltation? And if you do not do well, sin is lying at the door. And its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? He said, I do not know. Am I my brothers keeper?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>And He said, What have you done? The voice of your brothers blood cries out to Me from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>So now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brothers blood from your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>Behold, You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; I shall be hidden from Your face; I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, and it will happen that anyone who finds me will kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>And Jehovah said to him, Therefore, whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken upon him sevenfold. And Jehovah set a mark on Cain, so that anyone finding him should not kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son: Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>And Lamech took for himself two wives: the name of one was Adah, and the name of the second was Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>And Adah bore Jabal: He was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>His brothers name was Jubal: He was the father of all those who play the harp and flute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>And as for Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain: One hammering in every craft of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah: Hear my voice, you wives of Lamech, listen to my speech! For I have killed a man for wounding me, even a young man for striking me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>And the man knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name: Seth, for God has appointed another seed for me instead of Abel; because Cain killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>And as for Seth, to him also a son was born; and he called his name Enosh. Then they began to call upon the name of Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.1'>This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, He made him in the likeness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.2'>He created them male and female, and blessed them, and called their name Mankind in the day when they were created.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.3'>And Adam lived one hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.6.1'>Now it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.2'>that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were pleasing; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.3'>And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not continually strive with man, for indeed it is in flesh to sin; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.4'>There were giants on the earth in those days. And also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them, these were the mighty men from antiquity, men of renown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.5'>And Jehovah saw that the evil of man was great on the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all day long.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.6'>And Jehovah regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved to His heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.7'>And Jehovah said, I will obliterate man whom I have created from off the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing and flying creatures of the heavens, for I regret having made them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.8'>But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.9'>These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect in his generation. Noah walked with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.10'>And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.11'>The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.12'>And God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.13'>And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence through them; and behold, I will destroy them along with the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.14'>Make yourself an ark of gopherwood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.15'>And this is how you shall make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.16'>You shall make a window for the ark, and you shall finish it to a cubit from above; and set the door of the ark in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.17'>And behold I, even I, am bringing a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy from under the heavens all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.18'>And I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall go into the ark; you, your sons, your wife, and your sons wives with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.19'>And of every living thing of all flesh you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.20'>Of flying creatures after their kind, of animals after their kind, and of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two of every kind will come in to you, to keep them alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.21'>And take for yourself of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it shall be food for you and for them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.7.1'>And Jehovah said to Noah, Come into the ark, you and all your house, for I have seen you as being righteous before Me in this generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.2'>You shall take unto you of every clean animal seven and seven, a male and his female; and two each of animals that are not clean, a male and his female;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.7.6'>Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.7'>So Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons wives, went into the ark because of the waters of the flood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.7.10'>And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.11'>In the six hundredth year of Noahs life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of the heavens were opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.12'>And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.13'>On the very same day Noah and Noahs sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and Noahs wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.7.15'>And they went into the ark to Noah, two by two, of all flesh in which is the breath of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.16'>So those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him. And Jehovah shut him in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.17'>And the flood was on the earth forty days. The waters increased and lifted up the ark, and it was high above the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.18'>The waters prevailed and greatly increased upon the earth, and the ark moved about upon the surface of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.19'>And the waters prevailed with abundant force upon the earth, and all the high hills under the heavens were covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.20'>The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.21'>And all flesh died that moved on the earth: flying creatures and animals and living things and every creeping thing that moves on the earth, and every man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.7.23'>So He obliterated all living substance which was on the face of the ground: both man and animal, creeping thing and flying creatures of the heavens. They were obliterated from off the earth. Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark were left alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.24'>And the waters prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.8'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.1'>And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the animals that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.2'>The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were also stopped, and the rain from the heavens was restrained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.3'>And the waters receded from the earth, going out and coming back. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were decreased.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.8.5'>And the waters continued to go and decrease until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.6'>And it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.7'>And he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from off the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.8'>He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from off the face of the ground.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.8.10'>And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent the dove out from the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.11'>And the dove came to him in the evening, and behold, a freshly plucked olive leaf was in her mouth; so Noah knew that the waters had receded from off the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.8.13'>And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, that the waters were dried up from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the surface of the ground was dry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.14'>And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.15'>And God spoke to Noah, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.8.17'>Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you: flying creatures and animals and every creeping thing that moves on the earth, so that they may swarm on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.18'>So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.19'>Every living thing, every creeping thing, every flying creature, and everything that moves on the earth, according to their kind, went out of the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.20'>And Noah built an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.21'>And Jehovah smelled a soothing aroma. And Jehovah said in His heart, I will never again curse the ground because of man, although the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth; nor will I again smite every living thing as I have done.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.18.19'>For I have known him, in order that he may command his children and his house after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice, that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken to him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.18.21'>I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry against it that has come to Me; and if not, I will know.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.18.23'>And Abraham approached and said, Would You also sweep away the righteous with the wicked?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.24'>Suppose there were fifty righteous within the city; would You also destroy the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous that were in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.25'>Far be it from You to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.26'>And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.27'>Then Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I who am but dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.28'>Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous; would You destroy all of the city for lack of five? And He said, If I find forty-five there, I will not destroy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.29'>And he spoke to Him yet again and said, Suppose there should be forty found there? And He said, I will not do it for the sake of forty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.30'>Then he said, Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Suppose thirty should be found there? And He said, I will not do it if I find thirty there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.31'>And he said, Indeed now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord: Suppose twenty should be found there? And He said, I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.32'>And he said, Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak but once more: Suppose ten should be found there? And He said, I will not destroy it for the sake of ten.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.27.37'>Then Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brethren I have given to him as servants; with grain and wine I have sustained him. What shall I do now for you, my son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.38'>And Esau said to his father, Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me; me also, O my father! And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.29.11'>And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.12'>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her fathers relative and that he was Rebekahs son. So she ran and told her father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.30.39'>And the flocks mated before the rods, and the flocks gave birth to streaked, speckled, and spotted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.40'>And Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the streaked and all the brown in the flock of Laban; but he put his own flocks by themselves and did not put them with Labans flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.41'>And it came to pass, whenever the stronger livestock were in heat, that Jacob placed the rods before the eyes of the livestock in the troughs, that they might mate among the rods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.42'>And when the flocks were feeble, he did not put them in; so the feebler were Labans and the stronger Jacobs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.43'>And the man increased exceedingly greatly, and had many cattle, female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.31'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.1'>Now Jacob heard the words of Labans sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our fathers, and from what was our fathers he has acquired all this wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.2'>And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and behold, it was not toward him as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.3'>And Jehovah said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.4'>So Jacob sent and summoned Rachel and Leah to the field, to his flock,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.5'>and said to them, I see your fathers countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.6'>And you know that with all my strength I have served your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.7'>Yet your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times, but God has not allowed him to do evil to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.8'>If he said thus: The speckled shall be your wages, then all the flocks bore speckled. And if he said thus: The streaked shall be your wages, then all the flocks bore streaked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.9'>So God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.10'>And it happened, at the time when the flocks were in heat, that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which mounted the flocks were streaked, speckled, and spotted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.11'>And the Angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, Jacob. And I said, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.12'>And He said, Lift up your eyes now and see, all the rams which mount the flocks are streaked, speckled, and spotted; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.13'>I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar and where you vowed a vow to Me. Now arise, get out of this land, and return to the land of your kindred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.14'>And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our fathers house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.15'>Are we not considered foreigners by him? For he has sold us, and also devoured and consumed our money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.16'>For all these riches which God has taken from our father are ours and our sons. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.17'>Then Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.18'>And he drove away all his livestock and all his possessions which he had gained, his acquired livestock which he had gained in Paddan, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.19'>And Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel had stolen the household idols that were her fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.20'>And Jacob stole away, unknown to Laban the Aramean, in that he did not tell him that he was fleeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.21'>So he fled with all that he had. He arose and crossed the river, and set his face toward the mountains of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.22'>And Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.23'>And he took his brethren with him and pursued him for seven days journey, and he overtook him in the mountains of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.24'>And God come to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night, and said to him, Beware that you not speak to Jacob from good to evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.25'>So Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountains, and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountains of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.26'>And Laban said to Jacob: What have you done, that you have stolen away unknown to me, and led away my daughters like captives of the sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.27'>Why did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and not tell me; for I might have sent you away with joy and songs, with timbrel and harp?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.28'>And you did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters. Now you have done foolishly in so doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.29'>It is in the power of my hand to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Beware that you not speak to Jacob from good to evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.30'>And now you have proceeded to depart because you have longed for your fathers house. But why have you stolen my gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.31'>And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid; for I said, Lest you would take your daughters from me by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.32'>With whomever you find your gods, do not let him live. In the presence of our brethren, identify what I have of yours and take it with you. For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.33'>And Laban went into Jacobs tent, into Leahs tent, and into the two maidservants tents, but he did not find them. Then he went out of Leahs tent and entered Rachels tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.34'>Now Rachel had taken the household idols, put them in the camels saddle, and sat on them. And Laban groped all about the tent but did not find them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.35'>And she said to her father, Let it not burn in the eyes of my lord that I cannot rise before you, for the manner of women is with me. And he searched but did not find the household idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.36'>And Jacob was furious and complained to Laban, and Jacob answered and said to Laban: What is my transgression? What is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.37'>Although you have searched all my things, what of your household articles have you found? Set it here before my brethren and your brethren, that they may judge between us both!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.38'>These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried their young, and I have not eaten the rams of your flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.39'>That which was torn by beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it. You required it from my hand, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.40'>There I was: In the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.41'>Thus I have been in your house twenty years; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.42'>Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, and rebuked you last night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.43'>And Laban answered and said to Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks; all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.44'>Now therefore, come, let us make a covenant, you and me, and let it be a witness between you and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.45'>So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a monument.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.46'>And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones. And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there on the heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.47'>Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.48'>And Laban said, This heap is a witness between you and me this day. Therefore its name was called Galeed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.49'>also, Mizpah; because he said, May Jehovah watch between you and me when we are hidden (being absent) one from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.50'>If you afflict my daughters, or if you take other wives besides my daughters, although no man is with us; consider that God is witness between you and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.51'>And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap and this pillar, which I have cast between me and you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.52'>This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a testimony, that I will not pass beyond this heap to you, and you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, for evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.53'>The God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, and the God of their father judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.54'>And Jacob slaughtered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread. And they ate bread and stayed all night on the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.55'>And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and daughters and blessed them. And Laban departed and returned to his place.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.32'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.1'>So Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.2'>And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is the camp of God. And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.3'>And Jacob sent messengers before his face to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the land of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.4'>And he commanded them, saying, Speak thus to my lord Esau, Thus your servant Jacob says: I have sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.5'>And I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.6'>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and he also is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.7'>And Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two companies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.8'>For he thought, If Esau comes to the one company and strikes it, then the other company which is left shall escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.9'>And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, Jehovah who said to me, Return to your land and to your kindred, and I will deal well with you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.10'>I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the faithfulness which You have done for Your servant; for I crossed over this Jordan with my staff, and now I have become two companies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.11'>Rescue me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers to the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.12'>For You said, I will do good to deal well with you, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.13'>And he lodged there that night, and took what came to his hand as a present for Esau his brother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.14'>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.15'>thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.16'>And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put some space from drove to drove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.17'>And he commanded the first one, saying, When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, To whom do you belong, and where are you going? Whose are these before you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.18'>then you shall say, They are your servant Jacobs. It is a present sent to my lord Esau; and behold, he also is behind us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.19'>And he commanded the second, the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, You shall speak these words to Esau when you find him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.20'>and also say, Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us. For he thought, I will propitiate before his face with the present that goes before me, and afterward when I shall see his face, perhaps he will forgive me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.21'>So the present passed over before him, but he himself remained that night in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.22'>And he arose that night and took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of Jabbok.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.23'>He took them, sent them over the brook, and sent over what he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.24'>And Jacob was left alone; and a Man wrestled with him until the dawn began to rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.25'>And when He saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacobs hip was out of joint as He wrestled with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.26'>And He said, Let Me go, for the dawn has risen. But he said, I will not let You go unless You bless me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.27'>And He said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.28'>And He said, Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have persevered with God and with men, and have prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.29'>And Jacob asked, saying, Please tell me Your name. And He said, Why is it that you ask about My name? And He blessed him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.30'>And Jacob called the name of the place Penuel: For I have seen God face to face, and my soul is delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.31'>Just as he crossed over Penuel the sun rose over him, and he was limping on his thigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.32'>Therefore to this day the children of Israel do not eat the muscle tendon which is on the hip socket, because He touched the socket of Jacobs hip on the muscle tendon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.33.1'>And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and with him were four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.2'>And he put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.33.7'>And Leah also came near with her children, and they bowed down. Afterward Joseph and Rachel came near, and they bowed down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.8'>And Esau said, What do you mean by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the eyes of my lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.33.10'>And Jacob said, No, please, if I have now found favor in your eyes, then receive my present from my hand, inasmuch as I have seen your face as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.11'>Please, take my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have everything I need. So he urged him, and he took it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.33.13'>But Jacob said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds which are nursing are with me. And if the men should drive them hard one day, all the flock will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.14'>Please let my lord go on ahead before his servant. I will lead on gently according to the pace of the livestock that go before me, and the feet of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.15'>And Esau said, Now let me leave with you some of the people who are with me. But he said, What need is there? Let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.35.1'>And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there; and make an altar there to the Mighty God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.2'>And Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, and change your garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.3'>Let us arise and go up to Bethel; and I will make an altar there to the Mighty God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me in the way which I have gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.4'>So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree which was by Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.5'>And they journeyed, and the terror of God was upon the cities all around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.6'>So Jacob came to Luz (which is Bethel), in the land of Canaan, he and all the people with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.7'>And he built an altar there and called the place El Bethel, because there God had revealed Himself to him when he fled from the face of his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.8'>Now Deborah, Rebekahs nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak tree. So the name of it was called Allon Bachuth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.9'>And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came out of Paddan, and blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.10'>And God said to him, Your name is Jacob; your name shall not be called Jacob anymore, but Israel shall be your name. And He called his name Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.11'>God also said to him: I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall proceed from you, and kings shall come forth from your loins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.12'>The land which I gave Abraham and Isaac I give to you; and to your seed after you I give this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.13'>And God ascended from him in the place where He had spoken with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.14'>And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He had spoken with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.15'>And Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.16'>And they journeyed from Bethel. And when there was still some ground to cover to arrive at Ephrath, Rachel was giving birth, and she had hard labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.17'>And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, Do not fear; you shall have this son also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.18'>And so it was, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-Oni; but his father called him Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.19'>And Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (which is Bethlehem).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.20'>And Jacob set a pillar on her grave, which is the pillar of Rachels grave to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.21'>And Israel journeyed and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.22'>And it happened, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his fathers concubine; and Israel heard about it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.23'>the sons of Leah were Reuben, Jacobs firstborn, and Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.24'>the sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.25'>the sons of Bilhah, Rachels maidservant, were Dan and Naphtali;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.26'>and the sons of Zilpah, Leahs maidservant, were Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.27'>And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, to the city of Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.28'>And the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.29'>And Isaac expired and died, and was gathered to his people, being old and fulfilled in days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.36'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.1'>Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.2'>Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite; Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.3'>and Basemath, Ishmaels daughter, sister of Nebajoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.4'>Now Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.5'>And Aholibamah bore Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.6'>And Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the souls of his house, his cattle and all his animals, and all his possessions which he had gained in the land of Canaan, and went to a land away from the presence of his brother Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.7'>For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together, and the land where they were sojourners could not support them because of their livestock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.8'>So Esau dwelt in Mount Seir. Esau is Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.9'>And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.10'>These were the names of Esaus sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, and Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.11'>And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.12'>And Timna was a concubine to Eliphaz, Esaus son, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These were the sons of Adah, Esaus wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.13'>These were the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath, Esaus wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.14'>These were the sons of Aholibamah, Esaus wife, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon. And she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.15'>These were the chiefs of the sons of Esau: The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn son of Esau, were Chief Teman, Chief Omar, Chief Zepho, Chief Kenaz,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.16'>Chief Korah, Chief Gatam, and Chief Amalek. These were the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These were the sons of Adah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.17'>These were the sons of Reuel, Esaus son: Chief Nahath, Chief Zerah, Chief Shammah, and Chief Mizzah. These were the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom. These were the sons of Basemath, Esaus wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.18'>And these were the sons of Aholibamah, Esaus wife: Chief Jeush, Chief Jaalam, and Chief Korah. These were the chiefs from Aholibamah, Esaus wife, the daughter of Anah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.19'>These were the sons of Esau, who is Edom; and these were their chiefs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.20'>These were the sons of Seir the Horite who dwelt in the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.21'>Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir, in the land of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.22'>And the sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. Lotans sister was Timna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.23'>These were the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.24'>These were the sons of Zibeon: both Ajah and Anah. This was the Anah who found the water in the wilderness as he pastured the donkeys of his father Zibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.25'>These were the children of Anah: Dishon and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.26'>These were the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.27'>These were the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.36.30'>Chief Dishon, Chief Ezer, and Chief Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.31'>Now these were the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the children of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.32'>Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.33'>And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.34'>And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.35'>And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who struck Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his place; and the name of his city was Avith.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.37'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.1'>Now Jacob dwelt in the land where his father was a sojourner, in the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.2'>These are the generations of Jacob: Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. And the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his fathers wives; and Joseph brought an evil report of them to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.3'>Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a tunic reaching to the soles of his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.4'>But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.5'>And Joseph had a dream, and he told it to his brothers; and they hated him even more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.6'>And he said to them, Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.7'>For behold, we were binding sheaves in the field. Then behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves stood all around and bowed down to my sheaf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.8'>And his brothers said to him, Shall you indeed become king over us? Or shall you indeed rule over us? So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.9'>Then he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brothers, and said, Behold, I have dreamed another dream: and behold, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars bowed down to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.10'>And he told it to his father and his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall it come to pass that your mother and I and your brothers indeed come to prostrate ourselves to the earth before you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.11'>And his brothers were jealous of him; but his father treasured up these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.12'>And his brothers went to feed their fathers flock in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.13'>And Israel said to Joseph, Are not your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.14'>And he said to him, Please go and see if it is well with your brothers and well with the flocks, and bring back word to me. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.15'>And a certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, What are you seeking?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.16'>And he said, I am seeking my brothers. Please tell me where they are feeding their flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.17'>And the man said, They have departed from here, for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.18'>Now when they saw him from a distance, even before he came near them, they conspired against him to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.19'>And they said to one another, Behold, this master of dreams is coming!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.20'>Come now therefore, let us kill him and cast him into a pit; and we will say, Some evil beast has devoured him. And we shall see what will become of his dreams!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.21'>But Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands, and said, Let us not smite his soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.22'>And Reuben said to them, Do not shed blood, but cast him into this pit which is in the wilderness, and do not lay a hand on him; that he might rescue him out of their hands, and bring him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.23'>So it came to pass, when Joseph had come to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic reaching to the soles of his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.24'>And they took him and cast him into a pit. And the pit was empty; there was no water in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.25'>And they sat down to eat food. And they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices, balm, and myrrh, going and bringing them down to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.26'>And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is there if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.27'>Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brothers agreed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.28'>Then some Midianite traders passed by; and the brothers pulled Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.29'>And Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he tore his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.30'>And he returned to his brothers and said, The lad is no more; and I, where shall I go?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.31'>And they took Josephs tunic, killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the tunic in the blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.32'>And they sent the tunic reaching to the soles of the feet, and they brought it to their father and said, We have found this. Do you recognize whether it is your sons tunic or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.33'>And he recognized it and said, It is my sons tunic. An evil beast has devoured him. Joseph has been rent and torn to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.34'>And Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.35'>And all his sons and all his daughters arose to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and he said, I will go down into Sheol mourning for my son. Thus his father wept for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.36'>Now the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.38'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.1'>It came to pass at that time that Judah departed from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite whose name was Hirah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.2'>And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua, and he took her and went in to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.3'>And she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.4'>She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.5'>And she did so again and bore a son, and called his name Shelah. He was at Chezib when she bore him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.6'>Then Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.7'>But Er, Judahs firstborn, was evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and Jehovah killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.8'>And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brothers wife and marry her, and raise up seed to your brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.9'>But Onan knew that the heir would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in to his brothers wife, that he spoiled it on the ground, so as not to give seed to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.10'>And the thing which he did made the eye of Jehovah quiver; therefore He killed him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.11'>Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in your fathers house till my son Shelah is grown. For he thought, Lest he also die like his brothers. And Tamar went and dwelt in her fathers house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.12'>Now in the process of time the daughter of Shua, Judahs wife, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.13'>And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.14'>And she took off her widows garments, covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place which was on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.15'>When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, because she had veiled her face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.16'>And he turned aside to her by the way, and said, Please let me come in to you; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. So she said, What will you give me, that you may come in to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.17'>And he said, I will send a young goat from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a pledge till you send it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.18'>And he said, What pledge shall I give you? So she said, Your signet ring and cord, and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.19'>So she arose and went away, and laid aside her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.20'>And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the womans hand, but he did not find her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.21'>Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot who was openly by the wayside? And they said, There was no harlot here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.22'>So he returned to Judah and said, I have not found her. Also, the men of the place said there was no harlot there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.23'>And Judah said, Let her take them for herself, that we not be held in contempt; for I sent this young goat and you have not found her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.24'>And it came to pass, after about three months, that Judah was told, saying, Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; furthermore she is with child by prostitution. So Judah said, Bring her out and let her be burned!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.25'>When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man to whom these belong, I am with child. And she said, Please acknowledge whose these are; the signet ring and cord, and staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.26'>And Judah acknowledged them and said, She has been more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he never knew her again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.27'>And it came to pass, at the time for giving birth, that behold, twins were in her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.28'>And so it was, when she was giving birth, that the one put out his hand; and the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his hand, saying, This one came out first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.29'>And it happened, as he drew back his hand, that his brother came forth; and she said, How have you broken through this breach for yourself? Therefore his name was called Perez.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.30'>And afterward out came his brother who had the scarlet thread on his hand. And his name was called Zerah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.39'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.1'>Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. And Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian man, bought him from the hands of the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.2'>And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.3'>And his master saw that Jehovah was with him and that Jehovah made all he did to prosper in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.4'>And Joseph found favor in his eyes, and served him. And he appointed him over his house, and all that he had he entrusted to his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.5'>And it came to pass, from the time that he had appointed him over his house and all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptians house for Josephs sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had in the house and in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.6'>Thus he left all that he had in Josephs hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate. Now Joseph was handsome and good looking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.7'>And it came to pass after these things that his masters wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and she said, Lie with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.8'>But he refused and said to his masters wife, Behold, my master does not know what is with me in the house, and he has entrusted all that he has into my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.9'>There is no one greater in this house than I, nor has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great evil, and sin against God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.10'>And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day after day, that he did not give heed to her, to lie with her or to be with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.11'>And it happened about this time, when Joseph went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the house were inside,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.12'>that she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me. But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and went outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.13'>And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.14'>that she summoned the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, Behold, he has brought in to us a Hebrew man to make sport of us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.15'>And it happened, when he heard that I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me, and fled and went outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.16'>So she kept his garment with her until his master came into the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.17'>And she spoke to him with words like these, saying, The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to me to make sport of me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.18'>and it happened, as I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me and fled outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.19'>And it came to pass, when his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, saying, Your servant did to me after this manner, that his anger burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.20'>And Josephs master took him and put him into the prison house, the place where the kings prisoners were confined. And he was there in the prison house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.21'>But Jehovah was with Joseph and extended mercy to him, and He gave him favor in the eyes of the warden of the prison house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.22'>And the warden of the prison house entrusted into Josephs hand all the prisoners who were in the prison house; whatever they did there, it was his doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.23'>The warden of the prison house did not oversee anything that was under his hand, because Jehovah was with him; and whatever he did, Jehovah made it prosper.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.40.1'>And it came to pass after these things that the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt committed offense against their lord, the king of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.2'>And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.3'>And he put them into custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison house, the place where Joseph was confined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.4'>And the captain of the guard assigned Joseph to them, and he served them; so they were in custody for a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.5'>And the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, had a dream, both of them, each mans dream in one night and each mans dream with its own interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.6'>And Joseph came in to them in the morning and looked at them, and behold they appeared to be troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.7'>So he asked Pharaohs officers who were with him in the custody of his lords house, saying, Why are your faces sad today?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.8'>And they said to him, We each have had a dream, and there is no interpreter. So Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, please.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.9'>And the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, Behold, in my dream a vine was before me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.10'>and in the vine were three branches; it was as though it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.11'>And Pharaohs cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaohs cup, and put the cup into Pharaohs hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.12'>And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation: The three branches are three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.13'>Yet within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your place, and you shall put Pharaohs cup into his hand according to the former custom, when you were his cupbearer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.14'>But remember me when it is well with you, and please show kindness to me; make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.15'>For truly I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews; and also I have done nothing here that they should have put me into the dungeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.16'>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also in my dream saw three baskets of white bread on my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.17'>And in the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.40.20'>And it came to pass on the third day, which was Pharaohs birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and of the chief baker among his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.21'>And he restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearing again, and he put the cup into Pharaohs hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.22'>But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.41'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.1'>Then it came to pass, at the end of two years of days, that Pharaoh was dreaming: And behold, he was standing by the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.2'>And behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fine looking and fat of flesh; and they fed in the marshes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.3'>And behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, bad looking and thin of flesh, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.4'>And the bad looking and thin-fleshed cows ate up the seven fine looking and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.5'>And he went to sleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, plump and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.6'>And behold, seven thin heads, scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.7'>And the seven thin heads devoured the seven plump and full heads. And Pharaoh awoke, and lo, it was a dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.8'>And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and summoned all the astrologers of Egypt and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.9'>Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying: I remember my offenses this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.10'>When Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me into custody in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.11'>we each dreamed a dream in one night, he and I. Each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.12'>And there was a Hebrew lad with us there, a servant of the captain of the guard. And we told him, and he interpreted our dreams for us; to each man he interpreted according to his dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.13'>And it came to pass, just as he interpreted for us, so it happened. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.14'>Then Pharaoh sent and summoned Joseph, and they rushed him out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.15'>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that you can understand a dream, to interpret it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.16'>And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is someone besides me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.17'>And Pharaoh said to Joseph: Behold, in my dream I stood on the bank of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.18'>And behold, seven cows came up out of the river, fat of flesh and fine looking; and they fed in the marshes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.19'>And behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very bad looking and thin of flesh, such badness as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.20'>And the thin and bad cows ate up the first seven fat cows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.21'>And when they had entered their stomachs, it would not have been known that they had entered their stomachs, for they looked just as bad as at the beginning. So I awoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.22'>Also I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.23'>And behold, seven heads, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.24'>And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads. And I told this to the astrologers, but no one could explain it to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.25'>And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.26'>The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads are seven years; the dreams are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.27'>And the seven thin and bad cows which came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty heads scorched by the east wind are seven years of famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.28'>This is the word which I have spoken to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.29'>Behold, seven years of great plenty are coming throughout all the land of Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.30'>and after them seven years of famine will arise, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine will deplete the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.31'>And the plenty will not be perceived in the land because of the famine following after, for it will be very severe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.32'>And the dream was repeated unto Pharaoh twice because the thing is determined by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.33'>Now therefore, let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.34'>Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint deputies over the land, to collect one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven years of plenty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.35'>And let them gather all the food of those good years that are coming, and store up grain for food in the cities under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them guard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.36'>And that food shall be as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt, that the land may not perish during the famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.37'>And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.38'>And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.39'>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Inasmuch as God has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.40'>You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be ruled according to your word; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.41'>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.42'>And Pharaoh took his signet ring off his hand and put it on Josephs hand; and he clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.43'>And he made him ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried out before him, Bow the knee! So he set him over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.44'>And Pharaoh also said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without you no man may lift his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.45'>And Pharaoh called Josephs name Zaphnath-Paaneah. And he gave him as a wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On. So Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.46'>Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.47'>And in the seven years of plenty the land brought forth by handfuls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.48'>And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities; he laid up in every city the food of the fields which surrounded them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.49'>And Joseph gathered very much grain, as the sand of the sea, until he stopped counting, for it was without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.50'>And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.51'>And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God has made me forget all my toil and all my fathers house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.52'>And the name of the second he called Ephraim: For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.53'>And the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Egypt ended,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.54'>and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. And the famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.55'>And when all the land of Egypt was hungry, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.56'>And the famine was over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians. And the famine became severe in the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.57'>And all earth came to Joseph in Egypt to buy, because the famine was severe in all the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.43.13'>Take your brother also, and arise, go back to the man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.43.16'>And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Take these men to my house, and slaughter an animal and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.17'>And the man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men into Josephs house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.18'>And the men were afraid because they were brought into Josephs house; and they said, It is because of the money, which was returned in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may roll against us and fall upon us, to take us as slaves with our donkeys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.19'>And they came near to the steward of Josephs house and spoke with him at the entrance of the house,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.43.21'>but it happened, when we came to the lodging place, that we opened our sacks, and behold, each mans money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; so we have brought it back in our hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.22'>And we have brought down other money in our hands to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.23'>And he said, Peace to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.24'>So the man brought the men into Josephs house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys feed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.25'>And they made the present ready for Josephs coming at noon, for they heard that they would eat bread there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.26'>And when Joseph came into the house, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and prostrated before him to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.27'>And he asked after their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.28'>And they answered, Your servant our father is in good health; he is still alive. And they bowed down and prostrated themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.29'>And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mothers son, and said, Is this your younger brother of whom you spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to you, my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.30'>Now his compassions yearned for his brother; so Joseph made haste and sought somewhere to weep. And he went into his chamber and wept there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.31'>And he washed his face and came out; and he restrained himself, and said, Serve the food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.32'>And they set him a place by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; because the Egyptians could not eat food with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.33'>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men were astonished at one another.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.47.24'>And it shall come to pass in the harvest that you shall give one-fifth to Pharaoh; and four-fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and for your food, for those of your houses and as food for your little ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.25'>And they said, You have saved our lives; let us find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we will be Pharaohs servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.26'>And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have one-fifth, except for the land of the priests only, which did not become Pharaohs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.27'>And Israel remained in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they settled on property they owned there and grew and multiplied exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.28'>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacobs life was one hundred and forty-seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.29'>And the time drew near for Israel to die. And he called his son Joseph and said to him, Now if I have found favor in your eyes, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please do not bury me in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.30'>but let me lie with my fathers. You shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place. And he said, I will do as you have said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.31'>And he said, Swear to me. And he swore to him. And Israel prostrated himself on the head of the bed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.48'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.1'>Now it came to pass after these things that Joseph was told, Behold, your father is sick; and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.2'>And Jacob was told, they said, Behold, your son Joseph is coming to you. And Israel strengthened himself and sat up on the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.3'>And Jacob said to Joseph: God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.4'>and said to me, Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people, and give this land to your seed after you as an enduring possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.5'>And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.6'>Your offspring whom you beget after them shall be yours; they shall be called according to the name of their brothers in their inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.7'>But as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (which is Bethlehem).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.8'>And Israel saw Josephs sons, and said, Who are these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.9'>And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place. And he said, Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.10'>Now the eyes of Israel had become dull with age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.11'>And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see your face; but lo, God has also shown me your seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.12'>And Joseph brought them from beside his knees, and he prostrated with his face to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.13'>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israels left hand, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israels right hand, and brought them to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.14'>And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on Ephraims head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manassehs head, crossing his hands; for Manasseh was the firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.15'>And he blessed Joseph, and said: God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me since I was born to this day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.16'>the Angel who redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; let my name be called upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.17'>Now when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it caused his eye to quiver; so he took hold of his fathers hand to remove it from Ephraims head onto Manassehs head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.18'>And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.19'>But his father refused and said, I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.20'>And he blessed them that day, saying, In you Israel shall bless, saying, May God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh! And thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.21'>Then Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.22'>Moreover I have extended your shoulder above your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.49'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.1'>And Jacob summoned his sons and said, Gather around, that I may tell you what shall befall you in the last days:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.2'>Gather around and hear, you sons of Jacob, and listen to Israel your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.3'>Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.4'>Like bubbling water, you shall not excel, because you went up to your fathers bed; then you defiled it; he went up to my couch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.5'>Simeon and Levi are brothers; implements of violence are their weapons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.6'>Let not my soul enter their council; let not my honor be united to their assembly; for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they have hamstrung an ox.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.7'>Cursed is their anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for it is cruel! I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.8'>Judah, you are he whom your brothers shall praise; your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; your fathers children shall bow down before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.9'>Judah is a lions whelp; from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He bows down, he crouches like a lion; and as a lioness, who shall rouse him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.10'>The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a Lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to Him shall be the cleansing of the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.11'>Binding His donkey to the vine, and His donkeys colt to the choice vine, He has washed His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.12'>His eyes flashing with wine, and His teeth white with milk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.13'>Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore; he shall become a haven for ships, bordering Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.14'>Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between two burdens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.15'>He saw that the resting place was good, and that the land was pleasant. He bowed his shoulder to bear a burden, and became a servant to forced labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.16'>Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.17'>Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder by the path, that bites the horses heels so that its rider shall fall backward.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.49.20'>Bread from Asher shall be rich, and he shall produce kings delicacies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.21'>Naphtali is a deer let loose; he utters beautiful words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.22'>Joseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a spring; his branches have run over the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.23'>The archers have bitterly grieved him, shot at him and carried animosity against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.24'>But his bow remained steadfast, and the arms of his hands were made nimble by the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob; from the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.25'>by the Mighty God of your father who will help you, and by the Almighty who will bless you with blessings of the heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.26'>The blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of my ancestors, to the bounds of the enduring hills. They shall be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.27'>Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall distribute the spoils.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.49.33'>And when Jacob had finished commanding his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed and expired, and was gathered to his people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.50'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.1'>And Joseph fell on his fathers face, and wept over him, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.2'>And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.3'>Forty days were fulfilled for him, for such are the days fulfilled for those who are embalmed; and the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.4'>And when the days of his weeping were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.5'>My father made me swear, saying, Behold, I am dying; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me. Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.6'>And Pharaoh said, Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.7'>And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.8'>as well as all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his fathers house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.9'>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen, and it was a very great company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.10'>And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is on the other side of Jordan, and they mourned there with great and heavy lamentation. He observed seven days of mourning for his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.11'>And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, This is a great mourning of the Egyptians. Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is on the other side of Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.12'>So his sons did for him just as he had commanded them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.13'>For his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as property for a burial place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.14'>And after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.15'>And when Josephs brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, Perhaps Joseph will hold a grudge against us, and return and repay us for all the evil which we did unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.16'>So they sent a messenger to Joseph, saying, Before your father died he commanded, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.17'>Thus you shall say to Joseph: I beg you, please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin; for they did evil to you. Now, please, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.18'>And his brothers also went and prostrated before his face, and they said, Behold, we are your slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.19'>And Joseph said to them, Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.20'>As for you, you had devised evil against me; but God had planned it for good, in order to bring it about as it is this day, to save many people alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.21'>Now therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones. And he comforted them and spoke to their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.22'>And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his fathers house. And Joseph lived one hundred and ten years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.23'>And Joseph saw Ephraims children to the third generation. Also the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born upon Josephs knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.24'>And Joseph said to his brethren, I am dying; but God will attend to visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land of which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.25'>And Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, God will attend to visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.26'>So Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</verse>
