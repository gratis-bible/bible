      <chapter osisID='Ezek.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the River Chebar, that the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>On the fifth day of the month, which was in the fifth year of King Jehoiachins captivity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>the Word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the River Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was upon him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>And I looked, and behold, a whirlwind was coming out of the north, a great cloud with flashing fire in it; and brightness was all around it and radiating out of its midst like the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>Also from within it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the soles of calves feet. They sparkled like the color of burnished bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>And the hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides; and each of the four had faces and wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>Their wings joined one to another. They did not turn when they went, but each one went straight forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man; each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, each of the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and each of the four had the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>Thus were their faces. Their wings stretched upward; two wings of each one were joined to one another, and two covered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>And each one went straight forward; they went wherever the spirit was to go, and they did not turn when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches going back and forth among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>And the living creatures were running and returning, in appearance like a flash of lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>Now as I looked at the living creatures, behold, a wheel was on the earth beside the living creatures with its four faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship was like the color of beryl, and all four had the same likeness. The appearance of their workmanship was, as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>When they moved, they went toward any one of four directions; they did not change directions as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>As for their rims, they were so high that they were awesome; and their rims were full of eyes, all around the four of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>Wherever the spirit was to go, there they went, where the spirit went; and the wheels were lifted up alongside them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>When those went, these went; when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up alongside them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>The likeness of the expanse above the heads of the living creatures was like the color of an awesome crystal, stretched out above over their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>And under the expanse their wings spread out straight, one toward another. Each one had two which covered one side, and each one had two which covered the other side of their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>When they went, I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a tumult like the sound of an army; and when they stood still, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>And there was a voice from the expanse that was over their heads; whenever they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>And above the expanse over their heads was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like a sapphire stone; on the likeness of the throne was a likeness with the appearance of a man high above it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>Also from the appearance of His waist and upward I saw, as it were, the color of amber with the appearance of fire all around within it; and from the appearance of His waist and downward I saw, as it were, the appearance of fire with brightness all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>As the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the brightness all around it. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. So when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of One speaking.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>And He said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>Then the Spirit entered me when He spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard Him speak to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>And He said to me: Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>For they are impudent and hardhearted children. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>As for them, whether they hear or whether they forbear; for they are a rebellious house; yet they will know that a prophet has been among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions; do not be afraid of their words or dismayed by their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>You shall speak My Words to them, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear, for they are most rebellious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>And when I looked, behold, there was a hand stretched out to me; and lo, a scroll of a book was in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>And He spread it before me; and there was writing on the inside and on the outside, and written on it were lamentations and mourning and woe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>Moreover He said to me, Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat the scroll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>And He said to me, Son of man, feed your belly, and fill your stomach with this scroll that I give you. So I ate, and it was in my mouth like honey for sweetness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>Then He said to me: Son of man, Go. Come to the house of Israel and speak My Words to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>For you are not sent to a people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, but to the house of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>not to many people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have listened to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>But the house of Israel is not willing to listen to you, because they are not willing to listen to Me; for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>Like adamant stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead; do not be afraid of them, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>Moreover He said to me: Son of man, receive into your heart all My Words that I speak to you, and hear with your ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>And go! Come to the captives, to the children of your people, and speak to them and tell them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a great thunderous voice: Blessed is the glory of Jehovah from His place!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>I also heard the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching one another, and the sound of the wheels alongside them, and a great thunderous sound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>Then I came to the captives at Tel Abib, who dwelt by the River Chebar; and I sat where they sat, and remained there in shock among them seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>Now it came to pass at the end of seven days that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore hear the Word from My mouth, and give them warning from Me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>When I say to the wicked, You shall die the death, and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>Yet, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because you did not give him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man that the righteous should not sin, and he does not sin, he shall live life because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>And the hand of Jehovah was upon me there, and He said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and there I will talk with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>So I arose and went forth into the plain. And behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, like the glory which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>Then the Spirit entered into me and stood me on my feet, and spoke with me and said to me: Go, shut yourself inside your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>But you, O son of man, behold, they shall put ropes on you and bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and not be one rebuking them, for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah. He who hears, let him hear; and he who forbears, let him forbear; for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.1'>You also, son of man, take a clay tablet and lay it before you, and engrave on it a city, Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.2'>And lay siege against it, build a siege wall against it, and heap up a mound against it; set camps against it also, and place battering rams against it all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.3'>Moreover take for yourself an iron plate, and set it as an iron wall between you and the city. Set your face against it, and it shall be under siege, and you shall lay siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.4'>Lie also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. According to the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.5'>For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.6'>And when you have completed them, lie again on your right side; then you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have laid on you a day for each year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.7'>Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem; your arm shall be uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.8'>And surely I will put bands on you so that you cannot turn from one side to another till you have completed the days of your siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.9'>Also take for yourself wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them into one vessel, and make bread of them for yourself, according to the number of days that you lie on your side; three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.10'>And your food which you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from time to time you shall eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.11'>You shall also drink water by measure, one-sixth of a hin; from time to time you shall drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.12'>And you shall eat it as barley cakes; and bake it using dung of human excrement, in their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.13'>And Jehovah said, Even so shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.14'>So I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Behold, my soul has never been defiled from my youth till now; I have never eaten a carcass or a torn animal, nor has abominable flesh ever come into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.15'>Then He said to me, See, I am giving you cow manure instead of human dung, and you shall prepare your bread over it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.16'>Moreover He said to me, Son of man, behold, I will cut off the food supply in Jerusalem; and they shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and shall drink water by measure and in horror,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.17'>that they may lack bread and water, and be appalled with one another, and waste away because of their iniquity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.1'>And you, son of man, take a sharp knife, a barbers razor, take it to yourself and pass it over your head and your beard; then take scales to weigh and divide the hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.2'>You shall burn with fire one-third in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are finished; then you shall take one-third and strike around it with the sword, and one-third you shall scatter into the wind: and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.3'>You shall also take a small number of them and bind them in the edge of your garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.4'>Then take some of them again and throw them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From there a fire will go out into all the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.5'>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the midst of the nations and the lands all around her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.6'>And she has rebelled against My judgments by doing wickedness more than the nations, and against My statutes more than the lands that are all around her; for they have rejected My judgments, and they have not walked in My statutes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.7'>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have multiplied disobedience more than the nations that are all around you, have not walked in My statutes nor kept My judgments, nor even done according to the judgments of the nations that are all around you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.8'>therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold I, even I, am against you and will execute judgments in your midst in the eyes of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.9'>And I will do in you what I have never done, and the likes of which I will never do again, because of all your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.10'>Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in your midst, and sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in you, and all of you who remain I will scatter to all the winds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.11'>Therefore, as I live, says the Lord Jehovah, surely, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable idols and with all your abominations, therefore I will also diminish you; My eye will not spare, nor will I have any pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.12'>A third of you shall die of the pestilence, and be consumed with famine in your midst; and a third shall fall by the sword all around you; and I will scatter the other third to all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.13'>Thus shall My anger be spent, and I will cause My fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted; and they shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in My zeal, when I have spent My fury upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.14'>Moreover I will make you a waste and a reproach among the nations that are all around you, in the eyes of all who pass by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.15'>So it shall be a reproach, a taunt, a chastening, and a horror to the nations that are all around you, when I execute judgments against you in anger and in fury and in furious punishment. I, Jehovah, have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.16'>When I send against them the terrible arrows of famine which shall be for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, I will increase the famine upon you and cut off your food supply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.17'>Thus I will send against you famine and evil beasts, and they will bereave you. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword against you. I, Jehovah, have spoken.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.1'>And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.2'>Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.3'>and say, O mountains of Israel, hear the Word of the Lord Jehovah! Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the mountains, to the hills, to the ravines, and to the valleys: Behold I, even I, will bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.4'>And your altars shall be desolate, your incense altars shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain before your idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.5'>And I will lay the corpses of the children of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.6'>In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate, so that your altars may be laid waste and found guilty, your idols broken and brought to an end, your incense altars cut down, and your works blotted out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.7'>And the slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.8'>Yet I will leave a remnant, so that you may have some who escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered throughout the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.9'>And those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations where they are carried captive, because I was crushed by their adulterous heart which has turned away from Me, and by their eyes which go whoring after their idols; they will loathe themselves for the evils which they did in all their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.10'>And they shall know that I am Jehovah; I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.11'>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Strike with your hands and stamp with your feet, and say, Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.12'>He who is far off shall die by the pestilence, he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine. Thus will I spend My fury upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.13'>Then you shall know that I am Jehovah, when their slain are among their idols all around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every thick oak, wherever they offered soothing aromas to all their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.14'>Thus I will stretch out My hand against them and make the land desolate, yes, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblah, in all their dwelling places. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.7'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.1'>Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.2'>And you, son of man, thus says the Lord Jehovah to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.3'>Now the end has come upon you, and I will send My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will repay you for all your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.4'>My eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity; but I will repay your ways, and your abominations will be in your midst; then you shall know that I am Jehovah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.5'>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: An evil! An only evil! Behold, it has come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.6'>An end has come, the end has come; it has awakened against you; behold, it has come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.7'>Morning has come to you, you who dwell in the land; the time has come, a day of trouble is near, and not a shout of rejoicing in the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.8'>Now upon you I will soon pour out My fury, and spend My anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will repay you for all your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.9'>My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; I will repay you according to your ways, and your abominations that are in your midst. And you shall know that I am Jehovah who strikes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.10'>Behold, the day! Behold, it has come! Morning has gone forth; the staff has blossomed, pride has budded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.11'>Violence has risen up into a staff of wickedness; none of them shall remain, none of their multitude, none of their abundance, nor any eminent among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.12'>The time has come, the day draws near. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.13'>For the seller shall not return to what has been sold, though he may still be alive (for the vision concerns the whole multitude, and shall not change); no one will strengthen himself who lives in iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.14'>They have blown the trumpet and made everyone ready, but no one goes to battle; for My wrath is on all their multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.15'>The sword is outside, and the pestilence and famine within. Whoever is in the field will die by the sword; and whoever is in the city, famine and pestilence will devour him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.16'>Those who survive will escape and be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, each for his iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.17'>Every hand will be feeble, and every knee will be as weak as water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.18'>They will also be girded with sackcloth; trembling will cover them; shame will be on every face, and baldness on all their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.19'>They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will be like filthiness; their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah; they will not satisfy their souls, nor fill their stomachs, because it is the stumbling block of their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.20'>As for the beauty of His ornaments, He set it in majesty; but they made from it the images of their abominations; their detestable things; therefore I have made it like refuse to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.21'>And I will give it as plunder into the hands of strangers, and to the wicked of the earth as spoils; and they shall defile it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.23'>Make a chain, for the land is filled with bloody judgments, and the city is full of violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.24'>Therefore I will bring the most evil of the nations, and they will possess their houses; I will bring an end to the pomp of the strong, and their holy places shall be defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.25'>Destruction comes! They will seek peace, but there shall be none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.26'>Disaster will come upon disaster, and rumor will be upon rumor. Then they will seek a vision from a prophet; but the Law will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.27'>The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land will be terrified. I will do to them according to their way, and according to their judgment I will punish them. And they shall know that I am Jehovah!</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.8'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.1'>And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before me, that the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell upon me there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.2'>Then I looked, and there was a likeness, like the appearance of fire; from the appearance of His waist and downward, fire; and from His waist and upward, like the appearance of brightness, like the color of amber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.3'>And He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the heavens, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the north gate of the inner court, where the seat of the image of jealousy was, which provokes to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.4'>And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.5'>Then He said to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, toward the north at the gate of the altar, was this image of jealousy at the entrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.6'>Furthermore He said to me, Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, to make Me go far away from My sanctuary? Now turn again, you will see greater abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.7'>So He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.8'>Then He said to me, Son of man, dig into the wall; and when I dug into the wall, there was an opening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.9'>And He said to me, Go in, and see the evil abominations which they do there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.10'>So I went in and saw; and behold, every sort of creeping thing, abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, carved all around on the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.11'>And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan. Each man had a censer in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense went up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.12'>Then He said to me, Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the room of his idols? For they say, Jehovah does not see us, Jehovah has forsaken the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.13'>And He said to me, Turn again, and you will see greater abominations that they are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.14'>So He brought me to the door of the north gate of the house of Jehovah; and behold, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.15'>Then He said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Turn again, you will see greater abominations than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.16'>So He brought me into the inner court of the house of Jehovah; and behold, at the door of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah and their faces toward the east, and they were bowing down to the sun toward the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.17'>And He said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a trivial thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence; then they have returned to provoke Me to anger. Indeed they put the branch to their nose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.18'>Therefore I also will act in fury. My eye will not spare nor will I have pity; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.9'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.1'>Then He called out in my hearing with a loud voice, saying, Let those who have charge over the city draw near, each with his destroying weapon in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.2'>And, behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his shattering weapon in his hand. One man among them was clothed with linen and had a writers inkhorn at his side. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.3'>And the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub, where it had been, to the threshold of the house. And He called to the man clothed with linen, who had the writers inkhorn at his side;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.4'>and Jehovah said to him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.5'>To the others He said in my hearing, Go after him through the city and kill; do not let your eye spare, nor have pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.6'>Utterly slay old and young men, maidens and little children and women; but do not come near anyone on whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary. So they began with the elders who were before the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.7'>Then He said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go forth! And they went out and killed in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.8'>So it was, that while they were killing them, I was left alone; and I fell on my face and cried out, and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Will You destroy all the remnant of Israel in pouring out Your fury on Jerusalem?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.9'>Then He said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is filled with blood, and the city is full of perversity; for they say, Jehovah has forsaken the land; and, Jehovah does not see!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.10'>And as for Me also, My eye will neither spare, nor will I have pity, but I will recompense their deeds upon their own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.11'>And behold, the man clothed with linen, who had the inkhorn at his side, reported back and said, I have done as You commanded me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.10'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.1'>And I looked, and there in the expanse that was above the head of the cherubim, there appeared something like a sapphire stone, having the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.2'>Then He spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in among the wheels, under the cherub, fill your hands with coals of fire from among the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in before my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.3'>Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the house when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.4'>Then the glory of Jehovah went up from the cherub, and paused over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the glory of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.5'>And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even in the outer court, like the voice of Almighty God when He speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.6'>And it happened, when He had commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim, that he went in and stood beside the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.7'>And the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire that was among the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed with linen, who took it and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.8'>And under the cherubims wings appeared the form of a mans hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.9'>And when I looked, behold, four wheels were beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub and another wheel beside each other cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was as the color of a beryl stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.10'>As for their appearance, all four had one likeness; as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.11'>When they went, they went toward any of their four directions; they did not turn aside when they went, but followed in the direction the head was facing. They did not turn aside as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.12'>And their whole body, with their back, their hands, their wings, and the wheels that the four had, were full of eyes all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.13'>As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, Rolling Wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.14'>And each one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, the second face the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.15'>And the cherubim were lifted up. This was the living creature that I saw by the River Chebar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.16'>And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels themselves did not turn from beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.17'>When they stood still, these stood still; and when they rose up, these rose up; for the spirit of the living creature was in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.18'>Then the glory of Jehovah departed from the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.19'>And the cherubim lifted their wings and mounted up from the earth before my eyes. When they went out, the wheels were beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate of the house of Jehovah, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.20'>This is the living creature I saw under the God of Israel by the River Chebar, and I knew that they were cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.21'>Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.22'>And the likeness of their faces was the same as the faces which I had seen by the River Chebar, their appearance, even theirs. They each went straight forward.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.11'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.1'>Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the East Gate of the house of Jehovah, which faces eastward; and there at the door of the gate were twenty-five men, among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, rulers of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.2'>And He said to me: Son of man, these are the men who devise wickedness and give evil advice in this city,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.3'>Therefore, son of man, prepare your belongings for exile, and go into exile by day in their sight. You shall go from your place into exile to another place in their sight. It may be that they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.12.4'>By day you shall bring out your belongings in their sight, as though going into captivity; and at evening you shall go in their sight, like those who go into captivity.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.10'>Because, indeed, because they have seduced My people, saying, Peace! when there is no peace; and one builds a wall, and plasters it with whitewash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.11'>Say to those who plaster it with whitewash, that it will fall. There will be a flooding rain, and you, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall break it down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.12'>Surely, when the wall has fallen, will it not be said to you, Where is the mortar with which you plastered it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.13'>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will cause a stormy wind to break forth in My fury; and there shall be a flooding rain in My anger, and great hailstones in fury to consume it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.14'>Thus I will break down the wall you have plastered with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered; it will fall, and you shall be consumed in the midst of it. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.15'>Thus will I accomplish My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it with whitewash; and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who plastered it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.16'>that is, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace, declares the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.17'>Likewise, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; prophesy against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.18'>and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the women who sew amulets on their sleeves and make veils for the heads of people of every height, to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of My people, and save the souls alive to yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.19'>And will you profane Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, executing souls that should not die, and keeping alive the souls that should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.20'>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against your amulets by which you hunt souls to make them fly. I will tear them from your arms, and let the souls go, the souls you hunt to make them fly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.21'>I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people out of your hand, and they shall no longer be as prey in your hand. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.22'>Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not pained; and you have strengthened the hands of the wicked, so that he does not turn from his wicked way to restore his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.23'>Therefore you shall no longer see vanity nor divine divinations; for I will deliver My people out of your hand, and you shall know that I am Jehovah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.14'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.1'>Then some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.2'>And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.3'>Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces. Should I be inquired of at all by them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.4'>Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Everyone of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, and puts before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity, and then comes to the prophet, I, Jehovah will answer him who comes, according to the multitude of his idols,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.5'>that I may catch the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from Me through their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.6'>Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Repent, turn away from your idols, and turn your faces away from all your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.7'>For anyone of the house of Israel, or of the stranger who sojourns in Israel, who separates himself from Me and sets up his idols in his heart and puts before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity, and comes to a prophet to inquire of him concerning Me, I Jehovah will answer him by Myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.8'>I will set My face against that man and make him desolate as a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of My people. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.9'>And if the prophet is induced to speak anything, I Jehovah have induced that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from the midst of My people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.10'>And they shall bear their iniquity; the punishment of the prophet shall be the same as the punishment of the one who inquired,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.11'>that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me, nor be defiled anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be My people and I may be their God, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.12'>The Word of Jehovah came again to me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.13'>Son of man, when a land sins against Me by acting treacherously unfaithfully, I will stretch out My hand against it; I will cut off its supply of food, send famine on it, and cut off man and beast from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.14'>And although these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Lord Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.17'>Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, Sword, go through the land, and I cut off man and beast from it,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.19'>Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out My fury on it in blood, and cut off from it man and beast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.20'>although Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.21'>For thus says the Lord Jehovah: How much more shall it be when I send My four severe judgments on Jerusalem; the sword and famine and wild beasts and pestilence; to cut off man and beast from it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.22'>Yet behold, there shall be left in it a remnant who will be brought out, both sons and daughters; surely they will come out to you, and you will see their ways and their doings. Then you will be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, all that I have brought upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.14.23'>And they will comfort you when you see their ways and their doings; and you shall know that I have done nothing without cause, all that I have done in it, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.15'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.1'>And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.2'>Son of man, how is the wood of the vine, the vine branch, better than any other wood which is among the trees of the forest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.3'>Is wood taken from it to make any object? Or can men make a peg from it on which to hang any vessel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.4'>Instead, it is thrown into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both ends of it, and its middle is burned. Is it useful for any work?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.5'>Indeed, when it was whole, no object could be made from it. How much less will it be useful for any work when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.6'>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.7'>and I will set My face against them. They will go out from one fire, but another fire shall devour them. And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set My face against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.15.8'>And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted treacherously unfaithfully, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.16'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.1'>Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.2'>Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.3'>and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth are from the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.4'>As for your birth, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water to cleanse you; you were not rubbed with salt nor wrapped in swaddling cloths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.5'>No eye pitied you, to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you; but you were thrown out into the open field, for you yourself were loathed on the day you were born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.6'>And when I passed by you and saw you squirming in your blood, I said to you in your blood, Live! Yes, I said to you in your blood, Live!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.7'>I have made you a multitude, like a plant in the field; and you grew, became great, bedecked with ornaments. Your breasts were formed, your hair grew, but you were naked and bare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.8'>When I passed by you again and looked upon you, indeed your time was the time of love; so I spread the edge of My garment over you and covered your nakedness. Yes, I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine, declares the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.9'>Then I washed you in water; yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood, and I anointed you with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.10'>I clothed you in embroidered cloth and gave you sandals of badger skin; I clothed you with fine linen and covered you with silk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.11'>I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your wrists, and a chain on your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.12'>And I put a ring in your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown upon your head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.13'>Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate of fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and succeeded to royalty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.14'>Your fame went out among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through My splendor which I had bestowed upon you, declares the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.15'>But you trusted in your own beauty, committed adultery because of your fame, and poured out your harlotry on everyone passing by who would have it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.16'>You took some of your garments and adorned multicolored high places for yourself, and committed adultery on them. Such things should not happen, nor be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.17'>You have also taken your beautiful jewelry from My gold and My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images and committed adultery with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.18'>And you took your embroidered garments and covered them, and you set My oil and My incense before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.19'>Also My food which I gave you; the fine flour, oil, and honey which I fed you; you set it before them as a soothing aroma; and so it was, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.20'>Moreover you took your sons and your daughters, whom you bore to Me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your acts of harlotry a small matter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.21'>that you have slain My children and offered them up to them by causing them to pass through the fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.22'>And in all your abominations and acts of harlotry you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, squirming in your blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.23'>And so it was, after all your wickedness (Woe, woe unto you! declares the Lord Jehovah);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.24'>that you also built for yourself a mound, and made a high place for yourself in every open place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.25'>You built your high places at the head of every road, and made your beauty to be abhorred. You offered yourself to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your acts of harlotry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.26'>You also committed adultery with the Egyptians, your very fleshly neighbors, and increased your acts of harlotry to provoke Me to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.27'>Behold, therefore, I stretched out My hand against you, diminished your allotment, and gave you up to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your licentious ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.28'>You also committed adultery with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; indeed you committed adultery with them and still were not satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.29'>Moreover you multiplied your acts of harlotry in the land of Canaan, as far as Chaldea; and even then you were not satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.30'>How weak is your heart! declares the Lord Jehovah, seeing you do all these things; the deeds of a domineering woman of prostitution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.31'>You build your mound at the head of every road, and built your high place in every open place. Yet you were not like a prostitute, in that you scorned payment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.32'>You are an adulterous wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.33'>Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them to come to you from all around for your harlotry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.34'>You are the opposite of other women in your harlotry, because no one solicited you to be a prostitute. In that you gave payment but no payment was given you, therefore you are the opposite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.35'>Now then, O prostitute! Hear the Word of Jehovah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.36'>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because your filthiness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your harlotry with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children which you gave to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.37'>surely, therefore, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved, and all those you hated; I will gather them from all around against you and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.38'>And I will judge you as women who commit adultery or who shed blood are judged; I will bring blood upon you in fury and jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.39'>I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your mounds and break down your high places. They shall also strip you of your clothes, take your beautiful jewelry, and leave you naked and bare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.40'>They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones and cut you with their swords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.41'>And they shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women; and I will put an end to your harlotry, and you shall no longer hire lovers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.42'>So I will lay to rest My fury toward you, and My jealousy shall depart from you. I will be quiet, and be angry no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.43'>Because you did not remember the days of your youth, but agitated Me with all these things, surely I will also recompense your deeds upon your own head, says the Lord Jehovah. And you shall not commit licentiousness in addition to all your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.44'>Indeed everyone who quotes proverbs will use this proverb against you: Like mother, like daughter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.45'>You are your mothers daughter, loathing her husband and children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.46'>And your older sister is Samaria, who dwells with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who dwells to the south of you, is Sodom and her daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.47'>Yet you did not walk in their ways nor act according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you became more corrupt than they in all your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.48'>As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, neither your sister Sodom nor her daughters have done as you and your daughters have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.49'>Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughter had pride, fullness of food, and abundance of idleness; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.50'>And they were haughty and committed abomination before Me; therefore I took them away as I saw fit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.51'>Samaria did not commit half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all the abominations which you have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.52'>You who judged your sisters, bear your own shame also, because your sins were more abominable than theirs; they are more righteous than you. Yes, be disgraced also, and bear your own shame, because you justified your sisters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.53'>When I bring back their captives, the captives of Sodom and her daughters, and the captives of Samaria and her daughters, then I will also bring back the captives of your captivity among them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.54'>so that you may bear your own shame and be disgraced by all that you did, since you comforted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.55'>When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters return to their former state, then you and your daughters will return to your former state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.56'>For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.57'>before your wickedness was uncovered. It was like the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria and all those around her, and of the daughters of the Philistines, who despise you from all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.58'>You have paid for your licentiousness and your abominations, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.59'>For thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath by breaking the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.60'>Nevertheless I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.61'>Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed, when you receive your older and your younger sisters; and I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.62'>And I will establish My covenant with you. And you shall know that I am Jehovah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.63'>so that you may remember and be ashamed. And you will never open your mouth anymore because of your shame, when I provide atonement for you for all that you have done, declares the Lord Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.1'>And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.3'>and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle with large wings and long pinions, full of feathers of various colors, came to Lebanon and took the highest branch from the cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.4'>He cropped off its topmost young twig and carried it to a land of trade; he set it in a city of merchants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.5'>Then he took some of the seed of the land and planted it in a fertile field; he placed it by abundant waters and set it like a willow tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.6'>And it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature; its branches turned toward him, and its roots were under him. So it became a vine, brought forth branches, and put forth shoots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.7'>There was another great eagle with large wings and many feathers; and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and stretched its branches toward him, away from the garden terrace where it had been planted, that he might water it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.8'>It was planted in good soil by many waters, to bring forth branches, bear fruit, and become a majestic vine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.9'>Say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots, cut off its fruit, and leave it to wither? All of its sprouting leaves will wither, and no great power or many people will be needed to pluck it up by its roots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.10'>Behold, being planted, will it prosper? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It shall wither in the garden terrace where it sprouted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.11'>Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.12'>Say now to the rebellious house: Do you not know what these things mean? Tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon has come to Jerusalem and has taken its king and rulers, and led them with him to Babylon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.14'>that the kingdom might be low, that it might not lift itself up, but that by the keeping of his covenant it might stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.15'>But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he who does such things escape? Can he break a covenant and still be delivered?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.16'>As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke, there he shall die with him in the midst of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.17'>Nor will Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company do anything in the war, when they heap up a siege mound and build a wall to cut off many persons.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.4'>Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is Mine; the soul who sins shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.5'>But if a man is righteous and does what is just and right;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.6'>if he has not eaten on the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, nor defiled his neighbors wife, nor approached a menstruating woman;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.7'>if he has not oppressed anyone, but has restored to the debtor his pledge; has plundered no one by robbery, but has given his bread to the hungry and covered the naked with clothing;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.20'>The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not bear the guilt of the father, nor the father bear the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.21'>But if a wicked man turns from all his sins which he has done, keeps all My statutes, and does what is lawful and right, he shall live life; he shall not die.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.23'>Do I delight with pleasure in the death of the wicked? says the Lord Jehovah, and not that he should turn back from his ways and live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.24'>But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live?

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.29'>Yet the house of Israel says, The way of the Lord is not fair. O house of Israel, is it not My ways which are fair, and your ways which are not fair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.30'>Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, says the Lord Jehovah. Repent, and turn from all your transgressions, so that iniquity shall not be a stumbling block to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.31'>Cast away from you all the transgressions by which you have transgressed, and prepare for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit; for why will you die, O house of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.32'>For I have no pleasure in the death of one who dies, declares the Lord Jehovah. Therefore turn and live!</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.20'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.1'>It came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that certain men of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and sat before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.2'>Then the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.3'>Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Have you come to inquire of Me? As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.4'>Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Then cause them to know the abominations of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.5'>And say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: On the day when I chose Israel and raised My hand and swore to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt, I raised My hand and swore to them, saying, I am Jehovah your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.6'>On that day I raised My hand and swore to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.7'>Then I said to them, Each of you, throw away the abominations which are before his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am Jehovah your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.8'>But they rebelled against Me and would not obey Me. They did not, each man, cast away the abominations which were before their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said, I will pour out My fury upon them and fulfill My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.9'>But I acted for My names sake, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they were, in whose sight I had made Myself known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.10'>Therefore I made them go out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.11'>And I gave them My statutes and showed them My judgments, which, if a man does, he shall even live by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.12'>Moreover I also gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah who sets them apart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.13'>But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness; they did not walk in My statutes; they despised My judgments, which, if a man does, he shall even live by them; and they greatly defiled My Sabbaths. Then I said, I will pour out My fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.14'>But I acted for My names sake, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.15'>So I also raised My hand and swore to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.16'>because they despised My judgments and did not walk in My statutes, but profaned My Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.17'>Nevertheless My eye spared them from destruction. I did not make an end of them in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.18'>But I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor keep their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.21'>Nevertheless, the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, and did not keep My judgments, which, if a man does, he shall even live by them; but they profaned My Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out My fury on them and fulfill My anger against them in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.22'>Nevertheless I withdrew My hand and acted for My names sake, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.23'>And I raised My hand and swore to those in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.24'>because they had not executed My judgments, but had despised My statutes, profaned My Sabbaths, and their eyes followed after their fathers idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.25'>Therefore I also gave them up to statutes that were not good, and judgments by which they could not live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.26'>and I defiled them by their gifts, in that they caused all that open the womb to pass through the fire, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.27'>Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed Me, by being treacherously unfaithful to Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.28'>For when I brought them into the land concerning which I had raised My hand and sworn to give it to them, and they saw all the high hills and all the thick trees, there they offered their sacrifices and provoked Me with their offerings. There they also sent up their soothing aroma and poured out their drink offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.29'>Then I said to them, What is this high place to which you go? And its name is called Bamah to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.30'>Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Are you defiling yourselves in the manner of your fathers, and committing adultery with their abominations?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.31'>For when you offer your gifts and make your sons pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols, even to this day. So shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.32'>What you have in your mind shall never be, when you say, We will be like the nations, like the families in other lands, serving wood and stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.33'>As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, I will rule over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.34'>And I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the lands where you are scattered, with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.35'>And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will plead with you face to face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.36'>Just as I judged your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will judge you, declares the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.37'>I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.38'>I will purge out the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against Me. I will bring them out of the land where they dwell, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel. And you will know that I am Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.39'>As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Go, serve every one of you his idols, even hereafter, if you will not obey me. But profane My holy name no more with your gifts and your idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.40'>For on My holy mountain, on the mountain height of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, there all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, shall serve Me; there I will accept them, and there I will require your offerings and the firstfruits of your sacrifices, together with all your holy things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.41'>I will accept you as a soothing aroma when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the lands where you have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.42'>And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the land for which I raised My hand and swore to give it to your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.43'>And there you shall remember your ways and all your evil deeds with which you were defiled; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight because of all the evils that you have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.44'>And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have dealt with you for My names sake, not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.45'>Furthermore the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.46'>Son of man, set your face toward the south; drop a word toward the south and prophesy against the forest land, the South,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.47'>and say to the forest of the South, Hear the Word of Jehovah!

        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.48'>All flesh shall see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.21'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.1'>And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.2'>Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, drop a word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.3'>and say to the land of Israel, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, and I will draw My sword out of its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.4'>Because I will cut off both the righteous and the wicked from you, therefore My sword shall go out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.5'>that all flesh may know that I, Jehovah, have drawn My sword out of its sheath; it shall not return anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.6'>Sigh therefore, son of man, with a breaking heart, and groan with bitterness before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.7'>And it shall be when they say to you, Why are you sighing? that you shall answer, Because of the news; when it comes, every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it is coming and shall be brought to pass, declares the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.8'>Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.9'>Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says Jehovah! Say: A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.10'>It is sharpened to slaughter and butcher, polished to flash like lightning! Should we then make mirth? It despises the scepter of My son, as every tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.11'>And He has given it to be polished, that it may be handled; this sword is sharpened, and it is polished to be given into the hand of the slayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.12'>Cry and howl, son of man; for it will be against My people, against all the rulers of Israel. The sword will be thrown against My people; therefore slap your thigh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.13'>because it is a testing. And what if the sword despises even the scepter? It shall be no more, declares the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.14'>You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike hand to hand; strike. The third time let the sword be doubled. It is the sword that slays, the sword that slays the great men, that surrounds them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.15'>I have set the slaughter of the sword against all their gates, That the heart may melt and many may stumble. Ah! It is made bright; it is grasped for the slaughter:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.16'>Be sharp to the right! Set yourself to the left; wherever your face is appointed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.17'>I also will strike My hand to hand, and I will cause My fury to rest; I, Jehovah, have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.18'>The Word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.19'>And you, son of man, appoint for yourself two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; both of them shall come forth from the same land. Make a sign; put it at the head of the road to the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.20'>Appoint a road for the sword to go into Rabbah of the Ammonites, and to Judah, into fortified Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.21'>For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the road, at the head of the two roads, to use divination: he shakes the arrows, he consults the images, he looks at the liver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.22'>In his right hand is the divination for Jerusalem: to set up battering rams, to call for a slaughter, to lift the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to heap up a mound, and to build a siege wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.23'>And it will be to them like a false divination in the eyes of those who have sworn oaths with them; but he will bring their iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.24'>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear; because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken with the hand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.16'>You shall defile yourself in the eyes of the nations; and you shall know that I am Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.17'>The Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.18'>Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me; they are all bronze, tin, iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.19'>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have all become dross, therefore behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.20'>As men gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into the midst of the furnace, to blow fire on it to melt it; so I will gather you in My anger and in My fury, and I will leave you there and melt you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.22'>As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall you be melted in its midst. And you shall know that I, Jehovah, have poured out My fury upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.23'>And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.24'>Son of man, say to her: You are a land that is not cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.25'>The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in her midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.26'>Her priests have violated My Law and defiled My holy things; they have not divided between the holy and profane, nor have they declared between the unclean and the clean; and they have hidden their eyes from My Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.27'>Her rulers in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey, to shed blood, to destroy souls, and to get dishonest gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.28'>Her prophets plastered them with whitewash, seeing vain visions, and divining lies to them, saying, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, when Jehovah has not spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.29'>The people of the land have used oppressions, committed robbery, and mistreated the poor and needy; and they wrongfully oppress the sojourner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.30'>So I sought for a man among them who would close up the wall, and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found no one.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.23'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.1'>The Word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.2'>Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.3'>They committed harlotry in Egypt, they committed harlotry in their youth; their breasts were handled, their virgin nipples were fondled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.4'>Their names: Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister; they were Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem is Oholibah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.5'>Oholah committed adultery even though she was Mine; and she lusted for her lovers, the neighboring Assyrians,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.6'>who were clothed in purple, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.7'>Thus she committed her adultery with them, all of them choice men of Assyria; and with all for whom she lusted, with all their idols, she defiled herself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.8'>She has never given up her harlotry brought from Egypt, for in her youth they had lain with her, fondled her virgin breasts, and poured out their immorality upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.9'>Therefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, for whom she lusted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.10'>They uncovered her nakedness, took away her sons and daughters, and slew her with the sword; she became a byword among women, for they had executed judgment on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.11'>Now although her sister Oholibah saw this, she became more corrupt in her lust than she, and in her harlotry, more than her sisters harlotry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.12'>She lusted for the neighboring Assyrians, captains and rulers, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.13'>Then I saw that she was defiled; both the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.14'>But she added to her harlotry; she looked at men portrayed on the wall, images of Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.15'>girded with waistbands around their waists, flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, in the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.16'>As soon as her eyes saw them, she lusted for them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.17'>And the Babylonians came to her, into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their immorality; so she was defiled by them, and her soul was alienated from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.18'>So she uncovered her harlotry and uncovered her nakedness. Then My soul was alienated from her, just as My soul was alienated from her sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.19'>Yet she multiplied her harlotry in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, when she had committed adultery in the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.20'>For she lusted for her paramours, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.21'>Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians fondled your nipples because of your youthful breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.22'>Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will stir up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them against you from every side:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.23'>The Babylonians, all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, all the Assyrians with them, all of them desirable young men, governors and rulers, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.24'>And they shall come against you with chariots, wagons, and wheels, with a company of people. They shall array against you buckler, shield, and helmet all around. I will entrust judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.25'>I will set My jealousy against you, and they shall deal furiously with you; they shall remove your nose and your ears, and the rest of you shall fall by the sword; they shall take your sons and your daughters, and the rest of you shall be devoured by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.26'>They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewelry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.27'>Thus I will make you cease your lewdness and your harlotry brought from the land of Egypt, so that you will not lift your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.28'>For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Surely I will deliver you into the hand of those you hate, into the hand of those from whom your soul is alienated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.29'>They will deal hatefully with you, take away all you have worked for, and leave you naked and bare. The nakedness of your adultery shall be uncovered, both your lewdness and your harlotry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.30'>I will do these things to you because you have gone whoring after the nations, because you have become defiled by their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.31'>You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will put her cup into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.32'>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: You shall drink of your sisters cup, deep and wide; you shall be laughed to scorn and held in derision; for it contains much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.33'>You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of horror and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.34'>You shall drink and drain it, you shall break its shards, and tear off your own breasts; for I have spoken, declares the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.35'>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, therefore you shall bear the penalty of your lewdness and your harlotry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.36'>Jehovah also said to me: Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.37'>For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols, and even sacrificed their sons whom they bore to Me, passing them through the fire, to devour them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.38'>Moreover they have done this to Me: They have defiled My sanctuary on the same day and profaned My Sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.39'>For after they had slain their children to their idols, on the same day they came into My sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, this they have done in the midst of My house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.40'>Furthermore you sent for men to come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and there they came. And you washed yourself for them, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.41'>You sat on a stately couch, with a table prepared before it, on which you had set My incense and My oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.42'>And the sound of a multitude at ease was with her, and drunkards were brought from the wilderness with men of the common sort, who put bracelets on their wrists and beautiful crowns on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.43'>Then I said concerning her who was worn out in adulteries, Will they commit adultery with her now, and she with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.44'>Yet they went in to her, as men go in to a woman of harlotry; thus they went in to Oholah and Oholibah, the lewd women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.45'>And righteous men will judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.46'>For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Bring up an assembly against them, give them up to terror and plunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.47'>And the company shall stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords. They shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.48'>Thus I will bring an end to lewdness from the land, that all women may be taught not to do according to your lewdness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.49'>And they shall repay you for your lewdness, and you shall pay for your idolatrous sins. And you shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.24'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.1'>Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.2'>Son of man, write down the name of the day, this very day; the king of Babylon has leaned against Jerusalem this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.3'>And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Put on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.4'>Gather pieces of meat into it, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder. Fill it with choice cuts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.5'>take the choice of the flock. Also pile bones under it, boil it to boiling, and let the cuts simmer in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.6'>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is in it, and whose scum is not gone from it! Bring it out piece by piece. Let no lot fall on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.7'>For her blood is in her midst; she set it on top of a rock; she did not pour it on the ground, to cover it with dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.8'>That it may raise up fury and take vengeance, I have set her blood on top of a rock, that it may not be covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.9'>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I too will make the pyre great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.10'>Heap on the wood, kindle the fire; cook the flesh well, mix in the spices, and let the bones be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.11'>Then set the pot empty on the coals, that it may become hot and its bronze may burn, that its filthiness may be melted in it, that its scum may be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.12'>She has grown weary with toil, and her great scum has not gone from her. Let her scum be in the fire!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.13'>In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you, and you were not cleansed, you will not be cleansed of your filthiness anymore, till I have caused My fury to rest upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.14'>I, Jehovah, have spoken it; it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not hold back, nor will I spare, nor will I have compassion; according to your ways and according to your deeds they will judge you, declares the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.15'>Also the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.16'>Son of man, behold, I am taking away from you the desire of your eyes with one stroke; yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, nor shall your tears run down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.17'>Groan in silence, make no mourning for the dead; bind your turban on your head, and put your sandals on your feet; do not cover your mustache, and do not eat the bread of men of sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.18'>So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died; and in the morning I did as I was commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.19'>And the people said to me, Will you not tell us what these things signify to us, that you behave so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.20'>Then I answered them, The Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.21'>Speak to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will profane My sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.33.9'>Nevertheless if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.33.10'>Therefore you, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: Thus you say, If our transgressions and our sins lie upon us, and we pine away in them, how can we then live?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.33.30'>As for you, son of man, the children of your people are talking about you beside the walls and in the doors of the houses; and they speak to one another, everyone saying to his brother, Please come and hear what the Word is that comes from Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.33.31'>So they come to you as people do, they sit before you as My people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them; for with their mouth they act out love, but their hearts go after their unjust gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.33.32'>Indeed you are to them as a singer of love songs, as one who has a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they do not do them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.34.6'>My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill; yes, My flock was scattered over the whole face of the earth, and no one was seeking or searching for them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.34.13'>And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the lands, and will bring them to their own land; I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the dwelling places of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.34.14'>I will feed them in a good pasture, and their fold shall be on the high mountains of Israel. There they shall lie down in a good fold and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.47'>And he measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, foursquare. And the altar was in front of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.48'>And he brought me to the porch of the house and measured the pillars of the porch, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; and the width of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.49'>The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; and by the steps which led up to it there were columns by the pillars, one on this side and another on that side.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.41'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.1'>Then he brought me into the sanctuary and measured the pillars, six cubits wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other side; the width of the tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.2'>And the width of the entryway was ten cubits, and the side walls of the entrance were five cubits on this side and five cubits on the other side; and he measured its length, forty cubits, and its width, twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.3'>And he went inside and measured the doorposts, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits high; and the width of the entrance, seven cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.4'>He measured the length, twenty cubits; and the width, twenty cubits, beyond the sanctuary; and he said to me, This is the Holy of Holies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.5'>Next, he measured the wall of the house, six cubits. The width of each side room all around the house was four cubits on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.6'>The side rooms were in three stories, one above the other, thirty rooms in each story; they rested on ledges which were for the side rooms all around, that they might be supported, but not fastened to the wall of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.7'>As one went up from story to story, the side rooms became wider all around, because their supporting ledges in the wall of the house ascended like steps; therefore the width of the structure increased as one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way of the middle one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.8'>I also saw the height of the house all around; the foundation of the side rooms was a full rod, that is, six cubits high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.9'>The thickness of the outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits, and so was also the remaining area of the side rooms of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.10'>And between it and the rooms was a width of twenty cubits all around the house on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.11'>The doors of the side rooms opened toward the open area, one door toward the north and another toward the south; and the width of the open area was five cubits all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.12'>The building that faced the separate area at its western end was seventy cubits wide; the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.13'>So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate area with the building and its walls was one hundred cubits long.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.14'>And the width of the eastern face of the house, including the separate area, was one hundred cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.15'>And he measured the length of the building behind it, facing the separate area, with its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits, as well as the inner temple and the porches of the court,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.16'>their thresholds and the shuttered windows. And the galleries all around their three stories opposite the threshold were paneled with wood from the ground to the windows (the windows were covered),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.17'>from the space above the door, even to the inner room, as well as outside, and on every wall all around, inside and outside, by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.18'>And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. And each cherub had two faces,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.19'>so that the face of a man was toward a palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion toward a palm tree on the other side; thus it was made throughout the house all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.20'>From the ground to the space above the door, and on the wall of the temple, cherubim and palm trees were carved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.21'>The doorposts of the temple were square, as was the front of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one was as the appearance of the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.22'>The altar of wood, was three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its length, and its sides were of wood. And he said to me, This is the table that is before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.23'>The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.24'>The doors had two doors each, two turning doors: two for one door, and two doors for the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.25'>And Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the doors of the temple just like the ones carved on the walls. And wooden planks were on the front of the porch outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.26'>There were shuttered windows and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch; also on the side rooms of the house and on the planks.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.42'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.1'>Then he brought me out into the outer court, by the way toward the north; and he brought me into the room which was opposite the separate area, and which was in front of the building toward the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.2'>Facing the length, which was one hundred cubits (the width was fifty cubits), was the north door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.3'>Opposite the inner court of twenty cubits, and opposite the pavement of the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.4'>And in front of the rooms, toward the inside, was a walkway ten cubits wide, at a distance of one cubit; and their doors faced north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.5'>Now the upper rooms were shorter, because the galleries took away space from them more than from the lower and middle stories of the building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.6'>For they were in three stories and did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper level was shortened more than the lower and middle levels from the ground up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.7'>And a wall which was outside ran alongside the rooms, at the front of the rooms, toward the outer court; its length was fifty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.8'>The length of the rooms toward the outer court was fifty cubits, whereas that facing the temple was one hundred cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.9'>And under these rooms was the entrance on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.10'>There were rooms in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, opposite the separate area and opposite the building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.11'>And there was a walkway in front of them also, and their appearance was like the rooms which were toward the north; they were as long and as wide as the others, and all their exits and entrances were according to plan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.12'>And corresponding to the doors of the rooms that were facing south, as one enters them, there was a door in front of the walkway, the walkway directly in front of the wall toward the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.13'>Then he said to me, The north rooms and the south rooms, which are opposite the separate area, are the holy rooms where the priests who approach Jehovah shall eat the set apart, holy, offerings. There they shall lay the set apart, holy, offerings; the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.14'>When the priests enter them, they shall not go out of the holy room into the outer court; but there they shall leave their garments in which they minister, for they are holy. They shall put on other garments; then they may approach that which is for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.15'>Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out through the gate that faces toward the east, and measured it all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.16'>He measured the east side with the measuring rod, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.17'>He measured the north side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.18'>He measured the south side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.19'>He came around to the west side and measured five hundred rods by the measuring rod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.20'>He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, five hundred cubits long and five hundred wide, to separate the holy from the profane.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.43'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.1'>Afterward he brought me to the gate, the gate that faces toward the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.2'>And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.3'>It was like the appearance of the vision which I saw; like the vision which I saw when I came to destroy the city. The visions were like the vision which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.4'>And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by way of the gate which faces toward the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.5'>And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.6'>Then I heard Him speaking to me from the house. And standing beside me was a Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.7'>And He said to me, Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever. No more shall the house of Israel defile My holy name, they nor their kings, by their harlotry or with the carcasses of their kings on their high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.8'>When they set their threshold by My threshold, and their doorpost by My doorpost, with a wall between them and Me, they have defiled My holy name by the abominations which they have done; therefore I have consumed them in My anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.9'>Now let them put their harlotry and the carcasses of their kings far away from Me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.10'>Son of man, describe the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.11'>And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the house and its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, its entire design and all its ordinances, all its forms and all its laws. Write it down in their sight, so that they may keep its whole design and all its ordinances, and do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.12'>This is the law of the house: The entire region around the mountaintop is set apart, holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.13'>These are the measurements of the altar in cubits (the cubit is one cubit and a handbreadth): the base one cubit high and one cubit wide, with a rim all around its edge of one span. This is the upper part of the altar:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.14'>from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits; the width of the ledge, one cubit; from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits; and the width of the ledge, one cubit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.15'>The altar hearth is four cubits high, with four horns extending upward from the hearth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.16'>And the altar hearth is twelve cubits long, twelve wide, square at its four corners;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.17'>the ledge, fourteen cubits long and fourteen wide on its four sides, with a rim of half a cubit around it; its base, one cubit all around; and its steps face toward the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.18'>And He said to me, Son of man, thus says the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances for the altar on the day when it is made, for sacrificing burnt offerings on it, and for sprinkling blood on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.19'>And you shall give a young bull for a sin offering to the priests, the Levites (who are of the seed of Zadok, who approach Me to serve Me), says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.20'>You shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim around it; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.21'>Then you shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and burn it at the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.22'>On the second day you shall offer a kid of the goats that is whole for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.23'>When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull that is whole, and a ram that is whole from the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.43.24'>And you shall offer them before Jehovah, and the priests shall throw salt on them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt offering to Jehovah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.44'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.44.1'>Then He brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary which faces toward the east. And it was shut.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.45.25'>In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast, he shall do likewise for seven days, according to the sin offering, the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the oil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.46'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.1'>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that faces toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the Sabbath it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.2'>And the prince shall enter by way of the porch of the gate from the outside, and stand by the gatepost. The priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings. He shall bow down at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.3'>Likewise the people of the land shall bow down at the entrance to this gate before Jehovah on the Sabbaths and the new moons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.4'>And the burnt offering that the prince offers to Jehovah on the Sabbath day shall be six lambs that are whole, and a ram that is whole;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.5'>and the grain offering shall be one ephah for a ram, and the grain offering for the lambs, as he shall be able to give, as well as a hin of oil with every ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.6'>On the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull from the herd that is whole, six lambs, and a ram; they shall be ones that are whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.7'>And he shall prepare a grain offering of an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, as he is able for the lambs, and a hin of oil with every ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.8'>And when the prince enters, he shall go in by way of the porch of the gate, and go out the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.9'>But when the people of the land come before Jehovah on the appointed feasts, whoever enters by way of the north gate to bow down shall go out by way of the south gate; and whoever enters by way of the south gate shall go out by way of the north gate. He shall not return by way of the gate through which he came, but shall go out through the opposite gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.10'>And the prince shall be in their midst. When they go in, he shall go in; and when they go out, he shall go out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.11'>At the feasts and the appointed times the grain offering shall be an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, as he is able to give for the lambs, and a hin of oil with every ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.12'>Now when the prince makes a voluntary burnt offering or voluntary peace offering to Jehovah, the gate that faces toward the east shall then be opened to him; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he did on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he goes out the gate shall be shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.13'>You shall daily make a burnt offering to Jehovah of a lamb of the first year that is whole; you shall prepare it morning by morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.14'>And you shall prepare a grain offering with it every morning, a sixth of an ephah, and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour. This grain offering is a perpetual ordinance, to be made regularly to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.15'>Thus they shall prepare the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil, as a regular burnt offering every morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.16'>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: If the prince gives a gift of some of his inheritance to any of his sons, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.17'>But if he gives a gift of some of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of liberty, after which it shall return to the prince. But his inheritance shall belong to his sons; it shall become theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.18'>Moreover the prince shall not take any of the peoples inheritance by evicting them from their possession; he shall provide an inheritance for his sons from his own possession, so that none of My people may be scattered from his possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.19'>And He brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy rooms of the priests which face toward the north; and there was a place on the two sides westward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.20'>And he said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them out into the outer court to consecrate the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.21'>Then he brought me out to the outer court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, at every corner of the court there was another court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.22'>At the four corners of the court were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty wide; all four corners were the same size.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.23'>There was a row of building stones all around in them, all around the four of them; and cooking hearths were made under the rows all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.24'>And he said to me, These are the kitchens where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.47'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.1'>Then he brought me back to the entrance of the house; and there was water, flowing from under the threshold of the house toward the east, for the front of the house faces east; and the water was flowing from under the right side of the house, south of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.2'>He brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me around the outside to the outer gate that faces east; and there was water, running out on the right side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.3'>And when the man went out to the east with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the water came up to the ankles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.4'>Again he measured one thousand and brought me through the waters; the water came up to the knees. Again he measured one thousand and brought me through; the water came up to the waist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.5'>Again he measured one thousand, and it was a river that I could not cross, for the water was too deep; water in which one must swim, a river that could not be crossed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.6'>And he said to me, Son of man, have you seen this? And he brought me and returned me to the bank of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.7'>When I returned, there, along the bank of the river, were very many trees on one side and the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.8'>Then he said to me: This water flows toward the eastern region, goes down into the wilderness, and enters the sea. When it reaches the sea, its waters are healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.9'>And it shall be that every living thing that swarms, wherever the rivers go, will live. There will be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters go there; for they will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.10'>It shall be that fishermen will stand by it from En Gedi to En Eglaim; they will be places for spreading their nets. Their fish will be of the same kinds as the fish of the Great Sea, exceedingly many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.11'>But its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be given over to salt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.12'>And along the banks of the river, on this side and that, will grow all kinds of trees used for food; their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. They will bear fruit every month, because their water flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.13'>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: These are the borders by which you shall divide the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.14'>And you shall inherit it equally with one another; for I raised My hand and swore to give it to your fathers, and this land shall fall to you as your inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.15'>And this shall be the border of the land on the north: from the Great Sea, by the road to Hethlon, as one goes to Zedad,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.16'>Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim (which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath), to Hazar Hatticon (which is on the border of Hauran).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.17'>Thus the boundary shall be from the Sea to Hazar Enan, the border of Damascus; and as for the north, northward, it is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.18'>And on the east side you shall mark out the border from between Hauran and Damascus, and between Gilead and the land of Israel, along the Jordan, and to the Eastern Sea. This is the east side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.19'>And the south side, toward the south, shall be from Tamar to the waters of Meribah by Kadesh, along the brook to the Great Sea. This is the south side, toward the South.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.20'>And the west side shall be the Great Sea, from the southern boundary until one comes to a point opposite Hamath. This is the west side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.21'>Thus you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.22'>And it shall be that you will divide it by lot as an inheritance for yourselves, and for the strangers who sojourn among you and who bear children among you. They shall be to you as native-born among the children of Israel; they shall have an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.23'>And it shall be that in whatever tribe the stranger sojourns, there you shall give him his inheritance, declares the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.48'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.1'>Now these are the names of the tribes: From the northern border along the road to Hethlon at the entrance of Hamath, to Hazar Enan, the border of Damascus northward, in the direction of Hamath, there shall be one portion for Dan from its east to its west side;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.2'>by the border of Dan, from the east side to the west, one portion for Asher;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.3'>by the border of Asher, from the east side to the west, one portion for Naphtali;</verse>

And the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.9'>The offering that you shall contribute unto Jehovah shall be twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.10'>And this holy offering shall belong to the priests; on the north twenty-five thousand cubits in length, on the west ten thousand in width, on the east ten thousand in width, and on the south twenty-five thousand in length. And the sanctuary of Jehovah shall be in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.11'>It shall be for the priests of the sons of Zadok, who are consecrated, who have kept My charge, who did not go astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.12'>And this contribution of land that is offered shall be to them a thing set apart, holy, by the border of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.13'>And next to the border of the priests, the Levites shall have an area twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width; its entire length shall be twenty-five thousand and its width ten thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.14'>And they shall not sell or change any of it; nor pass through and take away the firstfruit of the land; for it is holy unto Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.15'>And the five thousand cubits in width that remain, along the edge of the twenty-five thousand, shall be for common use by the city, for dwellings and suburbs. And the city shall be in the middle of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.16'>These shall be its measurements: the north side four thousand five hundred cubits, the south side four thousand five hundred, the east side four thousand five hundred, and the west side four thousand five hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.17'>And the suburbs of the city shall be to the north two hundred and fifty cubits, to the south two hundred and fifty, to the east two hundred and fifty, and to the west two hundred and fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.18'>And the rest of the length, alongside the offering of the holy portion, shall be ten thousand cubits to the east and ten thousand to the west. It shall be adjacent to the offering of the holy portion, and its produce shall be for food to those who work in the city.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.20'>The entire offering shall be twenty-five thousand cubits by twenty-five thousand cubits, foursquare. You shall offer the holy offerings with the possession of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.21'>The rest shall belong to the prince, on one side and on the other of the holy offering and of the citys possession, next to the twenty-five thousand cubits of the offering as far as the eastern border, and westward next to the twenty-five thousand as far as the western border, adjacent to the tribal portions; it shall belong to the prince. It shall be the holy offering, and the sanctuary of the house in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.48.22'>Moreover, from the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city which are in the midst of what belongs to the prince, the area between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall belong to the prince.</verse>
