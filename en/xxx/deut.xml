  <div osisID='Deut' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.1'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.1'>These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side of the Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain opposite Suph, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>(It takes eleven days to get from Horeb by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that Jehovah had given him commandment concerning them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.4'>after he had struck Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.5'>On this side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this Law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>Jehovah our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: You have dwelt long enough at this mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>Turn and set out, and go to the mountains of the Amorites, to all the neighboring places in the plain, in the mountains and in the lowland, in the South and on the seacoast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the River Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>Behold, I have set the land before you; go in and possess the land which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers; to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; to give to them and their seed after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>And I spoke to you at that time, saying: I alone am not able to bear you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>Jehovah your God has multiplied you, and here you are today, as the stars of the heavens in multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>May Jehovah the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times more than you are, and bless you as He has promised you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>How can I alone bear your burdens and your loads and your disputes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.13'>Choose wise, understanding, and knowledgeable men from among your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.14'>And you answered me and said, The thing which you have spoken to us is good to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.15'>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and made them heads over you, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, rulers of tens, and officials for your tribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.16'>And I commanded your judges at that time, saying, Hear the cases between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the sojourner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.17'>You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small as well as the great; you shall not be afraid of any mans presence, for the judgment is Gods. And any matter that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.18'>And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.19'>So we set out from Horeb, and went through all that great and dreadful wilderness which you have seen on the way to the mountains of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God had commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.20'>And I said to you, You have come to the mountains of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God is giving to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.21'>Behold, Jehovah your God has set the land before you; go up and possess it, as Jehovah the God of your fathers has spoken to you; do not fear or be dismayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.22'>And all of you came near to me and said, Let us send men before us, and let them search out the land for us, and bring back word to us of the way by which we should go up, and of the cities into which we shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.23'>And the thing was good in my eyes; so I took twelve of your men, one man from each tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.24'>And they turned and went up into the mountains, and came to the Valley of Eshcol, and explored it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.25'>They also took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us; and they brought back word to us, saying, It is a good land which Jehovah our God is giving to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.26'>Nevertheless you would not go up, but rebelled against the mouth of Jehovah your God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.27'>and you murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.28'>Where shall we go up? Our brethren have caused our hearts to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to the heavens; moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.29'>Then I said to you, Do not be terrified, nor afraid of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.30'>Jehovah your God, who goes before you, He will fight for you, according to all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.31'>and in the wilderness where you have seen how Jehovah your God has carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went until you came to this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.32'>Yet, for all that, you did not believe Jehovah your God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.33'>who went in the way before you to search out a place for you to encamp, to show you the way you should go, in the fire by night and in the cloud by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.34'>And Jehovah heard the sound of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.35'>Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see that good land which I have sworn to give to your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.36'>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and his children I am giving the land upon which he has walked, because he has wholly followed Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.37'>Jehovah was also angry with me on account of you, saying, You also shall not go in there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.38'>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.39'>Moreover your little ones and your children, whom you say will be prey, who today have no knowledge of good and evil, they shall go in there; to them I will give it, and they shall possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.40'>But as for you, turn and set out into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.41'>Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against Jehovah; we will go up and fight, just as Jehovah our God commanded us. And each of you girded on his weapons of war, and were ready to go up into the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.42'>And Jehovah said to me, Say to them, Do not go up nor fight, for I am not among you; lest you be struck down before your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.43'>So I spoke to you; yet you would not listen, but rebelled against the mouth of Jehovah, and presumptuously went up into the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.44'>And the Amorites who dwelt in that mountain came out against you and chased you as bees do, and shattered you in pieces from Seir to Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.45'>And you returned and wept before Jehovah, but Jehovah would not listen to your voice nor give ear to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.46'>So you remained in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.2'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.1'>Then we turned and set out into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, as Jehovah had spoken to me, and we circled around Mount Seir many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.2'>And Jehovah spoke to me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.3'>You have circled around this mountain long enough; turn northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.4'>And command the people, saying, You are about to pass through the territory of your brethren, the sons of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore be very much on guard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.5'>Do not strive with them, for I am not giving you any of their land, no, not even one treading place for the souls of your feet, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.6'>You shall buy food from them with money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water from them with money, that you may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.7'>For Jehovah your God has blessed you in all the works of your hands. He has known your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years Jehovah your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.8'>And when we passed beyond our brethren, the sons of Esau who dwell in Seir, away from the way of the plain, away from Elath and Ezion Geber, we turned and passed by way of the wilderness of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.9'>And Jehovah said to me, Do not show hostility to Moab, nor contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot as a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.10'>(The Emim had dwelt there in times past, a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.11'>They were also regarded as giants, like the Anakim, but the Moabites call them Emim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.12'>The Horites formerly dwelt in Seir, but the sons of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their place, just as Israel has done to the land of their possession which Jehovah has given them.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.13'>Now rise up and cross over the valley of the Zered. So we crossed over the valley of the Zered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.14'>And the time that passed from Kadesh Barnea until we had crossed over the valley of the Zered was thirty-eight years, for all the generation of the men of war to be finished off from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah had sworn to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.15'>For indeed the hand of Jehovah was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp until they were consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.16'>So it was, when all the men of war had completely perished from among the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.17'>that Jehovah spoke to me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.18'>This day you are crossing over at Ar, the border of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.19'>And when you come near the children of Ammon, do not show hostility to them nor contend with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot as a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.20'>(That was also regarded as a land of giants; giants formerly dwelt there. But the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.21'>a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim. But Jehovah destroyed them before them, and they dispossessed them and dwelt in their place,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.22'>just as He had done for the sons of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them. They dispossessed them and dwelt in their place, even to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.23'>And the Avim, who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza; the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and dwelt in their place.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.24'>Rise up, set out, and cross over the river Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to possess it, and engage him in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.25'>This day I will begin to put the dread and terror of you upon the faces of the peoples under all the heavens, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble and writhe because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.26'>And I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.27'>Let me pass through your land; I will proceed directly on the way; I will neither turn aside to the right nor to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.28'>You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink; only let me pass through on foot,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.29'>just as the sons of Esau who dwell in Seir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar did for me, until I cross the Jordan to the land which Jehovah our God is giving to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.30'>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through; for Jehovah your God had made his spirit stubborn and hardened his heart, that He might deliver him into your hand, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.31'>And Jehovah said to me, Behold, I have begun to set Sihon and his land before you. Begin to possess it, that you may inherit his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.32'>And Sihon and all his people came out against us to do battle at Jahaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.33'>And Jehovah our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, his sons, and all his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.34'>We took all his cities at that time, and we utterly destroyed the men, women, and little ones of every city; we left none remaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.35'>We took only the livestock as plunder for ourselves, with the spoils of the cities which we took.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.36'>From Aroer, which is beside the River Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us; Jehovah our God delivered up all before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.37'>Only you did not go near the land of the children of Ammon; anywhere along the River Jabbok, nor to the cities of the mountains, nor wherever Jehovah our God had forbidden us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.3'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.1'>Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan; and Og king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.2'>And Jehovah said to me, Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand; you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.3'>So Jehovah our God also delivered into our hands Og king of Bashan, with all his people, and we struck him until he had no survivors remaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.4'>And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.5'>All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides a great many rural towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.6'>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.7'>And all the livestock and the spoils of the cities we plundered for ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.8'>And at that time we took the land from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the River Arnon to Mount Hermon</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.9'>(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.10'>all the cities of the plain, all Gilead, and all Bashan, as far as Salcah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.11'>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the giants. Behold, his bedstead was an iron bedstead (Is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon.): Nine cubits its length and four cubits its width, according to the cubit of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.12'>And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer by the River Arnon, and half the mountains of Gilead and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.13'>The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (All the region of Argob, with all Bashan, was called the land of the giants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.14'>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and called Bashan after his own name, Havoth Jair, to this day.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.15'>I also gave Gilead to Machir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.16'>And to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave from Gilead as far as the River Arnon, the middle of the river as the border, as far as the River Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.17'>the plain also, with the Jordan as the border, from Chinnereth as far as the east side of the sea of the plain (the Salt Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.18'>Then I commanded you at that time, saying: Jehovah your God has given you this land to possess. All your men of war shall cross over armed before your brethren, the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.19'>But your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in your cities which I have given you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.20'>until Jehovah has given rest to your brethren as He has to you, and they also possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving to them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you shall return to his possession which I have given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.21'>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God has done to these two kings; so will Jehovah do to all the kingdoms through which you pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.22'>You shall not fear them, for Jehovah your God Himself fights for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.23'>Then I besought Jehovah at that time, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.24'>O Lord Jehovah, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty hand, for what god is there in the heavens or on earth who can do according to Your works and Your might?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.25'>I pray, let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, those pleasant mountains, and Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.26'>But Jehovah was angry with me on your account, and would not listen to me. And Jehovah said to me: Enough from you! Speak no more to Me of this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.27'>Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes toward the west, the north, the south, and the east; behold it with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.28'>But commission Joshua, and encourage him and make him bold; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.29'>So we remained in the valley across from Beth Peor.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.4'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.1'>Now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am teaching you to do, that you may live, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers is giving to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.2'>You shall not add to the Word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, to keep the commandments of Jehovah your God which I am commanding you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.3'>Your eyes have seen what Jehovah did at Baal-Peor; for Jehovah your God has destroyed from among you all the men who followed Baal-peor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.4'>But you who held fast to Jehovah your God are alive today, every one of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.5'>Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, just as Jehovah my God has commanded me, for you to do them in the midst of the land which you are going in to possess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.6'>Keep and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the eyes of the peoples who will hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.7'>For what great nation is there whose God is near to it, as Jehovah our God is to us, in all that we call upon Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.8'>And what great nation is there that has such statutes and righteous judgments as are in all this Law which I am setting before you this day?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Deut.9'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.1'>Hear, O Israel: You are crossing over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.2'>a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you have known, and of whom you have heard it said, Who can stand before the sons of Anak?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.3'>Therefore understand today that Jehovah your God is He who goes over before you as a consuming fire. He will destroy them and bring them down before you; thus you shall dispossess them and destroy them quickly, as Jehovah has spoken to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.4'>Do not think in your heart, after Jehovah your God has cast them out before you, saying, Because of my righteousness Jehovah has brought me in to possess this land; but it is because of the wickedness of these nations that Jehovah is driving them out before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.5'>It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you are going in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations that Jehovah your God is driving them out before you, and that He may fulfill the word which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers; to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.6'>Therefore understand that Jehovah your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you are a stiff-necked people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.7'>Remember; do not forget how you provoked Jehovah your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you departed from the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.8'>Also in Horeb you provoked Jehovah to wrath, so that Jehovah was angry with you to have destroyed you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.9'>When I went up into the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which Jehovah had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.10'>And Jehovah gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them were all the words which Jehovah had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.11'>And it came to pass, at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Jehovah had given me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.12'>And Jehovah said to me, Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly; they have quickly turned aside from the way which I have commanded them; they have made themselves a molten image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.13'>Furthermore Jehovah spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.14'>Let Me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under the heavens; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.15'>So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire; and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.16'>And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Jehovah your God, and had made for yourselves a molten calf! You had turned aside quickly from the way which Jehovah had commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.17'>And I took the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.18'>And I fell down before Jehovah, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you had sinned in doing evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.19'>For I was afraid of the anger and fury with which Jehovah had been angry with you, to destroy you. But Jehovah gave heed to me at that time also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.20'>And Jehovah was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him; and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.21'>And I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed and ground it thoroughly, until it was as fine as dust; and I threw its dust into the brook that was coming down from the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.22'>Also at Taberah and Massah and Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked Jehovah to wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.23'>Likewise, when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you, then you rebelled against the mouth of Jehovah your God, and you did not believe Him nor obey His voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.24'>You have been rebellious against Jehovah from the day that I knew you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.25'>Thus I prostrated myself before Jehovah; forty days and forty nights I kept prostrating myself, because Jehovah had thought to annihilate you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.26'>Therefore I prayed to Jehovah, and said: O Lord Jehovah, do not destroy Your people and Your inheritance whom You have redeemed through Your greatness, whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.27'>Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not look on the stubbornness of this people, or on their wickedness or their sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.28'>lest the land from which You have brought us should say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring them to the land which He promised them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.29'>Yet they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You have brought out by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Deut.10'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.1'>At that time Jehovah said to me, Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to Me on the mountain and make yourself an ark of wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.2'>And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you have broken; and you shall put them in the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.3'>And I made an ark of acacia wood, hewed two tablets of stone like the first, and went up into the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.4'>And He wrote on the tablets according to the first writing, the Ten Commandments, which Jehovah had spoken to you in the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly; and Jehovah gave them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.5'>And I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as Jehovah had commanded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.6'>(Now the children of Israel journeyed from the wells of the sons of Jaakan to Moserah, where Aaron died, and where he was buried; and Eleazar his son served as priest in his place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.10.9'>Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah is his inheritance, just as Jehovah your God has spoken to him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.10'>And, as at the first time, I stayed in the mountain forty days and forty nights; Jehovah also had given heed to me at that time, and Jehovah had consented to not destroy you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.11'>And Jehovah said to me, Arise, proceed on your journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land which I have sworn to their fathers to give to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.12'>And now, Israel, what is Jehovah your God asking of you, but to fear Jehovah your God, to walk in all His ways and to love Him, to serve Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.31.27'>for I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. If today, while I am yet alive with you, you have been rebellious against Jehovah, then how much more after my death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.31.28'>Gather to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears and call Heaven and earth to testify against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.31.29'>For I know that after my death you will pervert yourselves to corruption, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days, because you will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.31.30'>And Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song to their conclusion:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.32.13'>He made him ride in the heights of the earth, that he might eat the produce of the fields; He made him suck honey from the rock, and oil from the rock of flint;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.32.19'>And when Jehovah saw it, He spurned them, because of the provocation of His sons and His daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.20'>And He said, I will hide My face from them, I will see what their end will be, for they are a perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.21'>They have provoked Me to jealousy by what is not the Mighty God; they have moved Me to anger by their vanities. So I will provoke them to jealousy by those who are not a people; I will move them to anger by a foolish nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.22'>For a fire has been kindled in my anger, and shall burn to the lowest Sheol; it shall consume the earth with her produce, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Deut.34'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.1'>And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is across from Jericho. And Jehovah showed him all the land of Gilead as far as Dan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.2'>all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the western Sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.3'>the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.4'>And Jehovah said to him, This is the land of which I have sworn to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed. I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.5'>So Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the mouth of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.6'>And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth Peor; but no one knows his grave to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.7'>Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eyes had not dimmed nor had his natural vigor abated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.8'>And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. And the days of weeping and mourning for Moses ended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.9'>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the Spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him; so the children of Israel heeded him, and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.10'>And since then there has not arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.11'>in all the signs and wonders which Jehovah had sent him to do in the land of Egypt, before Pharaoh, before all his servants, and in all his land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.12'>and by all the mighty hand and all the great terror which Moses had done in the eyes of all Israel.</verse>
