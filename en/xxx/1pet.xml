      <chapter osisID='1Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.1'>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the sojourners of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.2'>elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.4'>to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved in Heaven for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.5'>who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>that the testing of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found unto praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>whom having not seen you love. Though now you do not see Him yet, believing, you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>receiving the outcome of your faith; the salvation of your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>Of this salvation the prophets have sought out and searched diligently, who prophesied concerning the grace towards you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>searching for what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ who was in them was indicating when He testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glories after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>To them it was revealed that, not to themselves, but to us they were ministering the things which now have been reported to you through those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from Heaven; things which angels desire to look into.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and rest your hope fully upon the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>as obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts in your ignorance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>but as He who called you is holy, you also become holy in all conduct,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>because it is written, Be holy, because I am holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.17'>And if you call on the Father, who without partiality judges according to each ones work, behave yourselves throughout the time of your sojourning in fear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.18'>knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver or gold, from your vain way of life received by tradition from your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.19'>but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.20'>He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.21'>who through Him believe in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.22'>Since you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto sincere love of the brethren, love one another fervently out of a pure heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.23'>having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the Word of God which lives and abides forever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.24'>because All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.25'>but the Word of the Lord endures forever. Now this is the Word which by the gospel was preached to you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil speaking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.2'>as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.3'>if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.4'>Coming to Him as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God and precious,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious, and he who believes on Him will by no means be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.7'>Therefore, to you who believe, He is precious; but to those who are disobedient, The stone which the builders rejected has become the Head of the corner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>and a Stone of stumbling and a Rock of offense. They stumble, being disobedient to the Word, to which they also were appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>But you are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people of His possession, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>who once were not a people but are now the people of God, who did not have mercy but now have mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and sojourners, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>having your behavior honorable among the Gentiles, that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by your good works which they observe, glorify God in the day of visitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man because of the Lord; whether to the king as supreme,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>as free, yet not using liberty as a pretext for evil, but as bondservants of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and fair, but also to the perverse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>For this is commendable, if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering undeservedly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>For what praise is it if, when you are beaten for your faults, you endure it patiently? But when you do good and suffer, if you endure it patiently, this is favorable with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but gave Himself over to Him who judges righteously;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>Wives, likewise, be subject to your own husbands, that even if some do not obey the Word, they, without a word, may be won by the behavior of their wives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.2'>when they observe your pure behavior with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>Do not let your adornment be outward; arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on apparel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.4'>rather let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible beauty of a meek and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.5'>For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, being subject to their own husbands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose daughters you are if you do good and are not afraid with any terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>Husbands, likewise, dwell with them with understanding, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>Finally, all of you be of one mind, sympathetic; loving the brothers, be tenderhearted, be kind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, in order that you may inherit blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>For He who would love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.11'>Let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>And who is he who will harm you if you become imitators of what is good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>But even if you should suffer because of righteousness, you are blessed. And do not be afraid of their terror, nor be troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>having a good conscience, that when they speak against you as evildoers, those who falsely accuse your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>For it is better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>who formerly were disobedient, when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>There is also an antitype which now saves us; immersion (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>who has gone into Heaven and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers having been made subject to Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind, for he who has suffered in the flesh has been released from sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh in the lusts of men, but in the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>For we have spent enough of our past lifetime in doing the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in licentiousness, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>In this regard, they think it strange that you do not run with them in the same overflow of dissipation, blaspheming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>They will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>For this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>But the end of all things is at hand; therefore be of sound mind and calm in your prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>And above all things have fervent love for one another, for love will cover a multitude of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>Be hospitable to one another without murmuring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>As each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>If anyone speaks, let him speak as the words of God. If anyone ministers, let him do it as with the strength which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved, do not be astonished at the fiery trial which is to try you, as though something unheard of was happening to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>but rejoice in so far as you partake of Christs sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also rejoice with exceeding joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. According to them He is blasphemed, but according to you He is glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a meddler in other peoples matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this regard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>Now if the righteous one is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls to Him in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.1'>The elders who are among you I exhort, I who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory about to be revealed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.2'>Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but willingly, not eager for dishonest gain but with a ready mind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.3'>not exercising dominion over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.4'>and when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.5'>Likewise you that are younger, be subject to your elders. Yes, all of you be subject to one another, and be clothed with humility, for God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.6'>Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.7'>casting all your anxiety upon Him, because He cares about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.8'>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.9'>Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are experienced by your brethren in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.10'>But may the God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.11'>To Him be the glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.12'>By Silvanus, our faithful brother as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.13'>Those in Babylon, elect together with you, greet you; and so does Mark my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.14'>Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</verse>
