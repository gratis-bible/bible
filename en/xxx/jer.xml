      <chapter osisID='Jer.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.1'>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.2'>to whom the Word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.3'>It also came in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the carrying away captive of Jerusalem in the fifth month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.4'>Then, the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.5'>Before I formed you in the belly I knew you; and before you came forth out of the womb I consecrated you, and I ordained you a prophet to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.6'>Then I said, Alas, Lord Jehovah! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am a youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.7'>But Jehovah said to me, Do not say, I am a youth; for you shall go to all to whom I shall send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.8'>Do not be afraid of their faces, for I am with you to deliver you, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.9'>And Jehovah put forth His hand, and touched my mouth. And Jehovah said to me, Behold, I have put My Words in your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.10'>Behold, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.11'>And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what do you see? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.12'>And Jehovah said to me, You have seen well; for I will keep watch over My Word to perform it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.13'>And the Word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying, What do you see? And I said, I see a boiling pot; and its face is facing north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.14'>And Jehovah said to me, Out of the north an evil will be unleashed upon all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.15'>For behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says Jehovah; and they shall come, and they shall each one set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.16'>And I will pronounce My judgments against them regarding all their evil, those who have forsaken Me, and burned incense to other gods, and bowed down to the works of their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.17'>You therefore gird up your loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed at their faces, lest I shame you before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.18'>For behold, I have made you a fortified city this day, and an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its rulers, against its priests, and against the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.19'>And they shall fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you. For I am with you, says Jehovah, to deliver you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.1'>And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.2'>Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Jehovah, I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your betrothals, when you went after Me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.3'>Israel was holiness to Jehovah, and the firstfruits of His increase. All that devour him shall be held guilty; evil shall come upon them, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.4'>Hear the Word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.5'>Thus says Jehovah, What injustice have your fathers found in Me, that they have gone far from Me and have walked after vanity, and have become vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.6'>Nor did they say, Where is Jehovah who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of dry places, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man lived?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.7'>And I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat its fruit and its goodness; but when you entered, you defiled My land and made My inheritance an abomination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.8'>The priests did not say, Where is Jehovah? And they who handle the Law did not know Me; the shepherds also rebelled against Me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.9'>Therefore I will contend with you, says Jehovah, and with your childrens children I will make a complaint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.10'>For pass over the coasts of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider carefully, and see if there is such a thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.11'>Has a nation changed their gods, which are not gods? But My people have changed their Glory for that which does not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.12'>Be appalled, O heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid; be greatly desolated, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.13'>For My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me, the Fountain of Living Waters, to hew out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.14'>Is Israel a servant? Or is he a homeborn slave? Why is he plundered?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.15'>The young lions roared against him; they uttered their voice. And they made his land a waste; his cities are burned without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.16'>Also the children of Noph and Tahpanhes have fed on your crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.17'>Have you not brought this upon yourself, in that you have forsaken Jehovah your God, when He led you by the way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.18'>And now what are you doing on the way toward Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? Or what are you doing, going toward Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.19'>Your own evil shall correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you. Therefore know and see that it is an evil and bitter thing that you have forsaken Jehovah your God, and that My fear is not in you, says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.20'>For long ago you broke your yoke and tore apart your bonds; and you said, I will not transgress, when on every high hill and under every green tree you lay down like a harlot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.21'>Yet I planted you a noble vine, a true seed. How then have you turned into the degenerate shoots of an alien vine to Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.22'>For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet your iniquity is stained before Me, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.23'>How can you say, I am not defiled; I have not gone after the Baals? See your way in the valley, know what you have done! You are a swift camel crisscrossing its ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.24'>A wild ass used to the wilderness, in her cravings she sniffs at the wind; when she is in heat who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they will find her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.25'>Withhold your foot from being bare, and your throat from thirst. But you said, There is no hope. No! For I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.26'>As the thief is ashamed when he is found out, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their rulers, and their priests, and their prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.27'>saying to a tree, You are my father; and to a stone, You gave birth to me. For they have turned their back to Me, and not their face; but in the time of their distress they will say, Arise and save us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.28'>But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your distress; for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.29'>Why will you plead with Me? You all have rebelled against Me, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.30'>In vain I have chastened your children; they received no correction. Your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.31'>O generation, see the Word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of darkness? Why do My people say, We roam freely; we will come no more to You?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.32'>Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me days without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.33'>Why do you beautify your way to seek love? Therefore you have also taught the evil women your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.34'>Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents; I did not find them by secret search, but plainly on all these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.35'>Yet you say, Because I am innocent, surely His anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with you, because you say, I have not sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.36'>Why do you gad about so much to change your way? You also shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.37'>Indeed, you shall go out from this place, with your hands on your head. For Jehovah has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper by them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.1'>They say, If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him and becomes another mans, shall he return to her again? Would not that land be greatly polluted? But you have committed adultery with many lovers; yet turn back to Me, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.2'>Lift up your eyes to the desolate heights, and see. Where have you not been lain with and ravished? By the highways you have sat for them, like an Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your harlotry and with your evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.3'>Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you had a harlots forehead; you refused to be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.4'>Will you not now cry to Me, My father, You are the guide of my youth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.5'>Will He keep His anger forever? Will He keep it to the end? Behold, you have spoken and done all the evil things you could.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.6'>Jehovah also said to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and has committed adultery there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.7'>And after she had done all these things I said, Turn back to Me! But she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.8'>And I saw, when for all the causes for which backsliding Israel committed adultery, I put her away and gave her a certificate of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she also went and committed adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.9'>So it came to pass through the wantonness of her harlotry, that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and pieces of wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.10'>And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not returned to Me with her whole heart, but in pretense, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.11'>And Jehovah said to me, Backsliding Israel has shown herself to be more righteous than treacherous Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.12'>Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, O backsliding Israel, says Jehovah; and I will not cause My anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, says Jehovah, and I will not keep anger forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.13'>Only, acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against Jehovah your God and have scattered your ways to strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed My voice, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.14'>Return, O backsliding children, says Jehovah; for I am married to you. And I will take you, one from a city, and two from a family; and I will bring you to Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.15'>And I will give you shepherds according to My heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.16'>And it shall come to pass, when you have multiplied and increased in the land in those days, says Jehovah, that they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah! Nor shall it come to mind; nor shall they remember it; nor shall they seek it; nor shall it be made anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.17'>At that time Jerusalem shall be called, The Throne of Jehovah; and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem. Nor shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.18'>In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance to your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.19'>But I said, How shall I put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a beautiful inheritance among the multitudes of nations! And I said, You shall call Me, My Father, and shall not turn away from Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.20'>Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her companion, so you have dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.21'>A voice was heard on the desolate heights; weeping and supplications of the children of Israel; for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten Jehovah their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.22'>Return, O backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come to You; for You are Jehovah our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.23'>Truly, deception comes from the high hills, from the multitudes on the mountains. Truly, in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.24'>For shame has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.25'>We lie down in our shame, and our reproach covers us; for we have sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.1'>If you will return, O Israel, says Jehovah, return to Me. And if you will put away your abominations out of My sight, then you shall not waver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.2'>And you shall swear, Jehovah lives, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in Him, and in Him they shall glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.3'>For thus says Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and do not sow among thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.4'>Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your hearts, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest My fury come forth like fire, and burn so that no one can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.5'>Declare in Judah, and let it be heard in Jerusalem; and say, Blow the shofar in the land; cry out, gather together, and say, Gather yourselves and let us go into the fortified cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.6'>Set up the standard toward Zion, take refuge, do not wait around; for I will bring evil from the north, and great destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.7'>The lion has come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the nations has set out; he has gone forth from his place to make your land a waste. Your cities will fall into ruins without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.8'>Put on sackcloth for this, wail and howl; for the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned back from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.9'>And it shall come to pass in that day, says Jehovah, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the rulers; and the priests shall be appalled, and the prophets shall be stunned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.10'>Then I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Surely You have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You shall have peace; whereas the sword reaches to the soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.11'>At that time it shall be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind from the desolate heights in the wilderness blows toward the daughter of My people, not to sift nor to cleanse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.12'>A full wind from these places shall come unto Me. Now also I will pronounce judgment against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.13'>Behold, he shall come up like clouds, and his chariots like a tempest. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, for we are plundered!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.14'>O Jerusalem, wash your heart from evil so that you may be saved. How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.15'>For a voice declares from Dan, and proclaims affliction from Mount Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.16'>Tell it to the nations: Behold! proclaim against Jerusalem! Watchers are going to come from a distant land; and they will utter their voice against the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.17'>Like keepers of a field, they are against her all around; because she has rebelled against Me, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.18'>Your way and your doings have procured these things for you; this is your evil, because it is bitter, because it reaches to your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.19'>My stomach, my stomach! I am convulsed to my heart! My heart groans within me; I cannot be silent because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the shofar, the alarm of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.20'>Destruction upon destruction is proclaimed; for the whole land is devastated. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, my curtains in a moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.21'>How long shall I see the standard and hear the sound of the shofar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.22'>For My people are foolish; they have not known Me; they are foolish children, and they have no understanding. They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.23'>I looked on the earth, and, lo, it was without form and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.24'>I looked on the mountains, and, lo, they quaked; and all the hills moved to and fro.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.25'>I looked, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens had fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.26'>I looked, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of Jehovah, before His fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.27'>For thus Jehovah has said, The whole land shall be desolate, yet I will not make a full end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.28'>The earth shall mourn for this, and the heavens above shall be black, because I have spoken, I have purposed, and will not be moved to pity, nor will I turn back from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.29'>Every city shall flee at the sound of the horsemen and bowmen. They shall go into thickets and climb up among the rocks. Every city is abandoned, and not a man shall live in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.30'>And you, what will you do when you are ruined? Though you dress with crimson, though you put on ornaments of gold, though you make your eyes large with paint, you shall make yourself beautiful in vain; your lovers will despise you; they will seek your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.31'>For I have heard a voice as of a woman in labor, the anguish as of one bearing her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, gasping and spreading her hands, saying, Woe to me now! For my soul is weary because of murderers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.1'>Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in her open places, if you can find a man, if there is one who does justice, who seeks the truth; and I will pardon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.2'>And though they say, As Jehovah lives; surely they swear falsely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.3'>O Jehovah, are not Your eyes on the truth? You have stricken them, but they have not grieved; You have destroyed them, but they have refused to receive correction; they have made their faces harder than rock; they have refused to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.4'>So I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they do not know the way of Jehovah, nor the judgment of their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.5'>I will go to the great men, and will speak to them; for they have known the way of Jehovah and the judgment of their God. But these have broken the yoke together and have torn off the bonds!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.6'>Therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them, and a wolf of the deserts shall destroy them; a leopard shall watch over their cities. Everyone who goes out from there shall be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many and their backslidings are increased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.7'>How shall I pardon you for this? Your children have forsaken Me, and have sworn by those that are not gods. When I adjured them, then they committed adultery, and gathered themselves by troops in a harlots house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.10.5'>They are crafted into hammered work like a palm tree, and they cannot speak. They must be lifted up and carried, because they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them; for they are not able to do evil, neither is it in them to do good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.6'>There is none like You, O Jehovah; You are great, and Your name is great in might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.7'>Who would not fear You, O King of nations? For fear is befitting to You, because among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.8'>But they are, every one of them, dull-hearted and foolish; a piece of wood is a discipline in vanities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.9'>Silver beaten into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the craftsman, and of the hands of the goldsmith. Violet and purple is their clothing; they are all the work of skillful ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.10'>But Jehovah is the true God, He is the living God, and the eternal King. At His wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to endure His indignation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.11'>So you shall say to them, The gods who have not made the heavens and the earth, they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.12'>He has made the earth by His power; He has established the world by His wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by His understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.13'>When He utters His voice, there is the noise of much water in the heavens. He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; He makes lightnings with the rain, and brings forth the wind out of His treasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.14'>Every man is stupid in his knowledge; every refiner is dried up by the graven image; for his molten image is a lie, and no breath is in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.15'>They are vanity, the work of delusion; in the time of their judgment they shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.16'>The Portion of Jacob is not like them; for He is the Maker of all things; and Israel is the rod of His inheritance. Jehovah of Hosts is His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.17'>Gather up your bundle from the ground, you who live under the siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.18'>For thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land this once, and will distress them, so that they may find Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.19'>Woe to me for my ruin! My wound makes me sick. But I said, Surely this is an infirmity, and I must bear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.20'>My tent is plundered, and all my cords are broken; my children have gone away from me, and they are not. There is no one to stretch out my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.21'>For the shepherds have become stupid, and have not sought Jehovah, therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.22'>Behold, the sound of the report has come, and a great commotion out of the land of the north, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a den of dragons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.23'>O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man who walks to direct his own steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.24'>O Jehovah, correct me, but with justice; not in Your anger, lest You bring me to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.25'>Pour out Your fury on the nations who do not know You, and on the families who do not call on Your name; for they have eaten up Jacob and have devoured him, and have destroyed him, and have made his dwelling place desolate.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.11.1'>The Word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.2'>Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.3'>and say to them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Cursed is the man who does not obey the words of this covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.4'>which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey My voice and do according to all that I command you; so you shall be My people, and I will be your God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.5'>so that I may fulfill the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then I answered and said, Amen, O Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.6'>Then Jehovah said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.7'>For I admonished and testified to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, until this day, rising early and exhorting, saying, Obey My voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.8'>Yet they did not obey nor extend their ear, but walked each one in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but they did not do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.9'>And Jehovah said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.10'>They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear My Words. And they went after other gods, to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.11'>Therefore Jehovah says this: Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry to Me, I will not listen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.12'>Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to whom they offer incense. But they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.13'>For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah. And according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to that shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.14'>Therefore, do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry out to Me because of their trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.15'>What is My beloved doing in My house, since she has worked out many evil devices? Has the holy flesh taken away your evil from you? How then do you rejoice?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.16'>Jehovah called your name, Green Olive Tree, fair, with fine fruit. With a great roaring sound He has set fire to it, and its branches are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.17'>For Jehovah of Hosts who planted you has pronounced evil against you, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke Me to anger by offering incense to Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.18'>And Jehovah gave me knowledge of it, and I made it known; for You showed me their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.19'>But I was like a docile lamb being led to the slaughter. And I did not know that they had devised schemes against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, so that his name may be remembered no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.20'>But, O Jehovah of Hosts, who judges righteously, who tries the mind and the heart, let me see Your vengeance on them. For to You I have laid open my cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.21'>Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth who seek your life, saying, Do not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, that you do not die by our hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.22'>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.23'>and there shall be no remnant of them. For I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their punishment.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.12'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.1'>Righteous are You, O Jehovah, when I complain to You; yet let me speak with You about Your judgments. Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why are all those who deceive with treachery at ease?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.2'>You have planted them; yea, they take root. They grow, yea, they bring forth fruit. You are near in their mouth, but far from their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.3'>But You, O Jehovah, know me. You have seen me and tried my heart toward You. Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and consecrate them for the day of slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.4'>How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither from the evil of those who dwell in it? The beasts and the birds have been swept away; because they said, He shall not see our last end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.5'>If you have run with footmen, and they wore you out, then how can you compete with horses? And if you feel secure in the land of peace, then how will you do in the swelling of the Jordan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.6'>For even your brothers and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you. Yea, they have called out a multitude after you. Do not believe them, though they speak pleasant things to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.7'>I have forsaken My house; I have left My inheritance. I have given the dearly beloved of My soul into the hand of her enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.8'>My inheritance is to Me as a lion in the forest; it cries out against Me; therefore I have hated it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.9'>My inheritance is like a speckled bird to Me; the birds all around are against her. Go, gather all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.10'>Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard; they have trampled My portion under foot; they have made My pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.11'>They have made it a desolation. Being desolate, it mourns to Me. The whole land is made desolate because no man lays it to heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.12'>The plunderers have come upon all high places through the wilderness; for the sword of Jehovah shall devour from one end of the land even to the other end of the land. No flesh shall have peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.13'>They have sown wheat, but reap thorns. They have tired themselves out, but to no profit. And they shall be ashamed of your harvests because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.14'>Thus says Jehovah against all My evil neighbors who touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit: Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.15'>And it shall be, after I have plucked them out, that I will return and have compassion on them, and will bring them back, each man to his inheritance and each man to his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.16'>And it shall be, if they will carefully learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, As Jehovah lives (as they taught the people to swear by Baal), then they shall be established in the midst of My people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.12.17'>But if they will not obey, I will pull up, root out, and destroy that nation, says Jehovah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.13'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.1'>Thus Jehovah said to me, Go and buy for yourself a linen waistband, and put it around your waist, and do not put it in water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.2'>So I bought a waistband according to the Word of Jehovah, and put it around my waist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.3'>And the Word of Jehovah came unto me a second time, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.4'>Take the waistband that you bought, which is around your waist, and arise. Go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.5'>So I went and hid it by Euphrates, as Jehovah commanded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.6'>And it came to pass at the end of many days that Jehovah said to me, Arise, go to the Euphrates and take the waistband from there, which I commanded you to hide there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.7'>Then I went to the Euphrates and dug, and took the waistband from the place where I had hidden it. And, behold, the waistband was rotten; it was good for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.8'>Then the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.9'>Thus says Jehovah, In this way I will spoil the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.10'>This evil people, who refuse to hear My Words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart and walk after other gods to serve them and to bow down to them, shall even be like this waistband, which is good for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.11'>For as the waistband clings to the waist of a man, so I have caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to Me, says Jehovah; so that they might be a people unto Me, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory; but they would not hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.12'>So you shall speak to them this Word: Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine. And they shall say to you, Do we not perceive to know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.13'>Then you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit on Davids throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.14'>And I will smash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, says Jehovah. I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but will destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.15'>Hear and give ear; do not be proud; for Jehovah has spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.16'>Give glory to Jehovah your God, before He causes darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and, while you are looking for light, He turns it into the shadow of death, and makes it gross darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.17'>But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and my eye shall weep and cry and run down with tears, because Jehovahs flock is taken captive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.18'>Say to the king and to the queen mother, Humble yourselves; sit down, for your dominion has come down, even the crown of your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.19'>The cities of the south have been shut up, and no one is opening; Judah has been exiled, all of it has been completely carried away captive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.20'>Lift up your eyes and look at those who come from the north. Where is the flock that was given to you, your beautiful sheep?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.21'>What will you say when he punishes you? For you have taught them to be chief rulers over you. Do not pangs seize you, like a woman in travail?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.22'>And if you say in your heart, Why have these things come upon me? It is because of the greatness of your iniquity; your skirts have been uncovered, and your heels have suffered violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.23'>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard its spots? Then you also may do good, who are accustomed to doing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.24'>Therefore I will scatter them as the stubble that passes away by the wind of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.25'>This is your lot, the portion I have measured to you, says Jehovah, because you have forgotten Me and trusted in falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.26'>Therefore I also have drawn up your skirts over your face, that your shame may be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.27'>I have seen your adulteries, and your neighings, the lewdness of your harlotry, and your abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! Will you not be made clean? How long will it still be?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.14.1'>The Word of Jehovah that came unto Jeremiah concerning the droughts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.2'>Judah mourns, and its gates languish. They mourn for the land, and the cry of Jerusalem has gone up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.3'>And their nobles have sent their little ones for water; they came to the cisterns, and found no water. They returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.4'>Because the ground is parched, for there was no rain on the earth, the plowmen were ashamed; they covered their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.5'>Yea, the doe also gave birth in the field and abandoned it, because there was no grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.6'>And the wild asses stood in the high places; they sniffed at the wind like dragons; their eyes failed because there was no grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.7'>O Jehovah, though our iniquities testify against us, work for Your names sake; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.8'>O the Hope of Israel, its Savior in time of trouble, why should You be like a sojourner in the land, and like a traveler who turns aside to lodge for the night?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.9'>Why should You be like a man astonished, as a mighty one who cannot save? Yet You, O Jehovah, are in our midst, and we are called by Your name. Do not leave us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.10'>Thus says Jehovah to this people: Thus they have loved to wander; they have not restrained their feet; therefore Jehovah does not accept them. He will now remember their iniquity and punish their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.11'>Then Jehovah said to me, Do not pray for this people for their good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.12'>When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. But I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.13'>Then I said, Ah, O Lord Jehovah! Behold, the prophets are saying to them, You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine; but I will give you sure peace in this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.14'>And Jehovah said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in My name; I did not send them, nor have I commanded them, nor did I speak to them. They prophesy to you a false vision and a worthless divination, and a thing of no value, and the deceit of their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.15'>Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the prophets who prophesy in My name, when I did not send them (yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land): by sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed.</verse>

For I will pour their evil upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.17'>Therefore you shall speak this word to them: Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and do not let them cease. For the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great break, with a sickening blow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.18'>If I go out into the field, then I see those killed with the sword! And if I enter into the city, then, behold, those that are sick from famine! Yes, both the prophet and the priest have gone up into a land that they do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.19'>Have You utterly rejected Judah? Has Your soul loathed Zion? Why have You stricken us such that there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for the time of healing, and behold, terror!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.14.20'>We acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against You.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.15.3'>And I will set over them four kinds, says Jehovah; the sword to kill, and the dogs to drag, and the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.15.4'>And I will make them a horror to all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.15.7'>And I will winnow them with a pitch fork in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children; I will destroy My people, since they have not turned back from their ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.15.8'>Their widows are more numerous around Me than the sand of the seas; I have brought on them, against a mother of a young man, a plunderer at noonday; I have caused anguish and terror to fall suddenly upon the city.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.16.1'>The Word of Jehovah also came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.16.2'>You shall not take a wife for yourself, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.16.3'>For thus says Jehovah concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place, and concerning their mothers who bore them, and concerning their fathers who begot them in this land:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.16.4'>They shall die from deaths of diseases; they shall not be mourned, nor shall they be buried. But they shall be as dung on the face of the earth. They shall be destroyed by the sword and by famine; and their carcasses shall be food for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.16.5'>For thus says Jehovah, Do not enter into the house of mourning; do not go to weep nor bemoan them. For I have taken away My peace from this people, says Jehovah, even lovingkindness and mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.16.6'>Both the great and the small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried, nor shall men mourn for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.16.8'>Also you shall not go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.16.9'>For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause the voice of mirth to cease out of this place before your eyes, and in your days, and the voice of gladness, and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.16.10'>And it shall be, when you proclaim to this people all these words, and they shall say to you, Why has Jehovah pronounced all this great evil against us? Or what is our iniquity, or what is our sin that we have sinned against Jehovah our God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.16.11'>Then you shall say to them, Because your fathers have forsaken Me, says Jehovah, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have bowed down to them, and have forsaken Me, and have not kept My Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.16.12'>And you have done worse than your fathers; for behold, you walk, each one, after the stubbornness of his evil heart, and do not listen to Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.16.13'>Therefore I will cast you out of this land into a land that you do not know, neither you nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other gods day and night; where I will not grant you favor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.16.16'>Behold, I will send for many fishermen, says Jehovah, and they will fish for them. And afterwards I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.16.17'>For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor is their iniquity hidden from My eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.16.18'>And first I will repay double their iniquity and their sin, because they have defiled My land, they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.16.19'>O Jehovah, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the nations shall come to You from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.16.20'>Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.16.21'>Therefore behold, this once I will make them know; I will cause them to know My hand and My might; and they shall know that My name is Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.18.4'>And the vessel that he made of clay was ruined in the hand of the potter; so he made it again into another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.18.5'>Then the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.18.6'>O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter? says Jehovah. Behold, as the clay is in the potters hands, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.18.7'>The instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck it up; or to pull it down, and to destroy it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.18.8'>if that nation, against whom I have spoken, will turn from their evil, I will be moved with compassion regarding the evil that I thought to do to them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.18.10'>if it does evil in My eyes, so that it does not obey My voice, then I will regret the good by which I said I would do good to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.18.11'>Now then, go speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am forming evil against you, and devising a plan against you. Return now, each one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.18.12'>And they said, There is no hope; but we will walk after our own thoughts, and we will each one do according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.18.13'>Therefore thus says Jehovah, Ask now among the nations; who has heard the likes of this? The virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.18.14'>Does the snow of Lebanon avoid the rock of the field? Or shall the cold flowing waters be forsaken for that which comes from another place?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.19.4'>because they have forsaken Me, and have given regard to this place and have burned incense in it to other gods whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.19.5'>They have also built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I never commanded nor spoke, nor did it even come into My mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.19.6'>Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but The Valley of Slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.19.7'>And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of those who seek their lives. And I will give their corpses as food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.19.8'>And I will make this city a desolation and a hissing. Everyone who passes by shall be amazed and shall hiss because of all its plagues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.19.9'>And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall each one eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and distress with which their enemies and those who seek their lives shall distress them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.19.10'>Then you shall break the jar before the eyes of the men who go with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.19.11'>and shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Even so I will break this people and this city, as one breaks a potters vessel, that cannot be made whole again. And they shall bury them in Tophet until there is no place left to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.19.12'>I will do this to this place, says Jehovah, and to its inhabitants, and make this city as Tophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.19.13'>And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be as defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of the heavens, and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.19.14'>Then Jeremiah came from Tophet, where Jehovah had sent him to prophesy. And he stood in the court of Jehovahs house, and said to all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.19.15'>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring on this city and on all its towns all the evil that I have spoken against it, because they have hardened their necks so that they might not hear My Words.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.20.8'>For whenever I speak, I cry out, I cry violence and devastation; for the Word of Jehovah has been a reproach and a derision to me all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.9'>Then I said, I will not make mention of Him, nor speak in His name any more. But His Word was in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with holding it in, and I could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.10'>For I have heard the whisperings of many, terror is all around. Proclaim, they say, and we will report it.

        <verse osisID='Jer.20.11'>But Jehovah is with me like a mighty, awesome one. Therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail. They shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not succeed. Their everlasting reproach shall never be forgotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.12'>But, O Jehovah of Hosts, who tries the righteous and sees the soul and the heart, let me see Your vengeance on them. For I have made my cause known to You.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.23.3'>And I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and will bring them back to their folds. And they shall be fruitful and multiply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.4'>And I will set up shepherds over them who will feed them. And they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed; nor shall they be lacking, says Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.23.9'>My heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake. I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of Jehovah, and because of the Words of His holiness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.23.12'>So their way shall be to them as slippery ways in the darkness; they shall be driven on, and fall in them; for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their punishment, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.13'>And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal and caused My people Israel to go astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.14'>I have also seen in the prophets of Jerusalem a horrible thing; they commit adultery and walk in falsehood. They also strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns back from his evil; they are all of them like Sodom to Me, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.23.15'>Therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them wormwood, and make them drink bitter water; for godlessness has gone forth from the prophets of Jerusalem into all the land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.27.1'>In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, this Word came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.2'>Thus says Jehovah to me, Make bonds and yokes for yourself, and put them on your neck,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.3'>and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.4'>And command them to go to their masters, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Thus you shall say to your masters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.5'>I have made the earth, man, and the animals on the face of the earth, by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and have given it to whom it seemed right to Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.6'>And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant. And I have also given him the beasts of the field to serve him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.7'>And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his sons son, until the time of his land comes. And then many nations and great kings shall make him serve them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.8'>And it shall be, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish, says Jehovah, with the sword and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.9'>Therefore, do not listen to your prophets, nor to your fortune tellers, nor to your dreamers, nor to your conjurers, nor to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.10'>For they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out and you should perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.11'>But the nations who bring their necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, those I will let remain on their own land, says Jehovah. And they shall work it and dwell in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.12'>I also spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.13'>Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Jehovah has spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.14'>Therefore do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon. For they prophesy a lie to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.15'>For I have not sent them, says Jehovah; yet they prophesy a lie in My name, so that I might drive you out, and that you might perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.16'>Also I spoke to the priests and to all the people, saying, Thus says Jehovah, Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Jehovahs house shall now shortly be brought back from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.17'>Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. For why should this city be laid waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.18'>But if they are prophets, and if the Word of Jehovah is with them, let them now make entreaties to Jehovah of Hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, may not go to Babylon.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.28'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.1'>And it happened in the same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur, the prophet of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of Jehovah in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.2'>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.3'>Within two full years I will bring back into this place all the vessels of Jehovahs house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried them to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.4'>And I will bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah who went into Babylon, says Jehovah; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.5'>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Jehovah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.6'>even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen. May Jehovah do so. May Jehovah establish your words which you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of Jehovahs house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.7'>But hear now this word that I speak in your ears and in the ears of all the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.8'>The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many lands and against great kingdoms; of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.9'>As for the prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then the prophet shall be known, that Jehovah has truly sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.10'>Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiahs neck and broke it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.11'>And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus says Jehovah, Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the time frame of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.12'>Then the Word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off of the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.13'>Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah: You have broken the yokes of wood, but you have made in their place yokes of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.14'>For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. And they shall serve him. And I have given him the beasts of the field also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.15'>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Jehovah has not sent you, but you make this people to trust in a lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.16'>Therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will drive you from off the face of the earth. You shall die this year, because you have taught rebellion against Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.17'>So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.29.2'>(After Jeconiah the king, and the queen mother, and the officials, the rulers of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, had departed from Jerusalem.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.3'>The letter came by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah the king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.29.9'>For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.10'>For thus says Jehovah, When according to My Word seventy years have been fulfilled at Babylon, I will visit you and carry out My good Word to you, to bring you back to this place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.29.15'>Because you have said, Jehovah has raised up prophets for us in Babylon;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.29.21'>thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in My name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall kill them before your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.22'>And a curse shall be taken up about them by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, May Jehovah make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.31.33'>But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel: After those days, says Jehovah, I will put My Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.34'>And they shall no more teach each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says Jehovah.

        <verse osisID='Jer.31.38'>Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that the city shall be built to Jehovah from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.39'>And the measuring line shall come out to the hill Gareb, and shall go around to Goath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.40'>And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields as far as the Kidron Valley, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be holy to Jehovah. It shall not be plucked up nor thrown down any more forever.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.32'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.1'>The Word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.2'>For then the army of the king of Babylon besieged Jerusalem. And Jeremiah the prophet was shut in the court of the guard, which was in the house of the king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.3'>For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy and say, Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.4'>and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall be given over and delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.5'>and he shall lead Zedekiah into Babylon, and there he shall be until I visit him, says Jehovah; though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.6'>And Jeremiah said, The Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.7'>Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you, saying, Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is yours, to buy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.8'>So Hanamel my uncles son came to me in the court of the guard according to the Word of Jehovah and said to me, Please buy my field in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the right of redemption is yours. Buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the Word of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.9'>And I bought the field in Anathoth, from Hanamel my uncles son, and weighed him the money, seventeen shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.10'>And I wrote it in the document, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed the silver in the scales.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.11'>So I took the document of the purchase, that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and the open copy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.12'>And I gave the document of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the eyes of Hanamel my uncles son, and in the eyes of the witnesses who wrote in the purchase document, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.13'>And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.14'>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Take these documents, the purchase document, the one sealed and the open document, and put them in an earthen vessel so that they may survive many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.15'>For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall be acquired again in this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.16'>And after I gave the purchase document to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to Jehovah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.17'>Ah, Lord Jehovah! You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.18'>You show lovingkindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them. The great, the strong and Mighty God, Jehovah of Hosts, is His name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.19'>great in counsel and mighty in work; for Your eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.20'>For You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, and in Israel and among men; and have made Yourself a name, as it is this day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.21'>and have brought forth Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.22'>And You have given them this land, which You swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.23'>And they came in and possessed it, but they have not obeyed Your voice, nor walked in Your Law. They have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have caused all this evil to come upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.24'>Behold, the siege mounds have come to the city to take it; and the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, the famine, and the pestilence. And what You have spoken has happened; and behold, there You see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.25'>And You have said to me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy the field for money, and take witnesses; yet the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.26'>Then the Word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.27'>Behold, I am Jehovah the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.28'>Therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.29'>And the Chaldeans who fight against this city shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke Me to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.30'>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only evil before Me from their youth. For the children of Israel have only provoked Me to anger with the work of their hands, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.31'>For this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and of My fury from the day that they built it, even to this day; that I should remove it from before My face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.32'>because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger; they, their kings, their rulers, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.33'>And they have turned the back to Me, and not the face; though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.34'>But they set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, to defile it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.35'>And they built the high places of Baal, in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I did not command them, nor did it even enter My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.36'>And now therefore, thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.37'>Behold, I will gather them out of all the lands where I have driven them in My anger, and in My fury, and in great wrath. And I will bring them back to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.38'>And they shall be My people, and I will be their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.39'>And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me forever, for their good and for the good of their children after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.40'>And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good. But I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.41'>Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will truly plant them in this land, with all My heart and all My soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.42'>For thus says Jehovah: Just as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.43'>And fields shall be bought in this land of which you say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.44'>Men shall buy fields for money, and write it in a document, and seal it, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south. For I will cause their captives to return, says Jehovah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.33'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.1'>And the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was still shut up in the court of the guard, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.2'>Thus says Jehovah the Maker, Jehovah who formed it in order to establish it; Jehovah is His name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.3'>Call unto Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and unfathomable things which you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.4'>For thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down to fortify against the siege mounds and the sword:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.5'>They come to fight with the Chaldeans, only to fill them with the dead bodies of the men whom I have slain in My anger and in My fury, for all whose evil I have hidden My face from this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.6'>Behold, I will bring it health and healing, and I will heal them and will show them the abundance of peace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.7'>And I will cause the captives of Judah and the captives of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.8'>And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against Me; and I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned, and by which they have transgressed against Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.9'>And it shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise and an honor before all the nations of the earth, who shall hear all the good that I do to them. And they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the welfare that I am bringing to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.10'>Thus says Jehovah: Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say is desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.11'>the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who shall say, Praise Jehovah of Hosts, for Jehovah is good, for His mercy is eternal; and the voice of those who shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of Jehovah. For I will cause the captives of the land to return, as at the first, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.12'>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Again in this place which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all its cities, there shall be a dwelling place of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.13'>In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him who counts them, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.14'>Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will establish the good thing which I have promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.15'>In those days, and at that time, I will cause the Branch of Righteousness to grow up to David; and He shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.16'>In those days Judah shall be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely. And this is the name by which she shall be called: JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.17'>For thus says Jehovah, David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.18'>nor shall the priests, the Levites, lack a man before Me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle grain offerings, and to sacrifice continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.19'>And the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.20'>Thus says Jehovah: If you can break My covenant of the day and My covenant of the night, so that there should not be day and night in their season,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.21'>then also may My covenant with David My servant be broken, that he should not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levites the priests, My ministers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.22'>As the host of the heavens cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured, so I will multiply the seed of David My servant and the Levites who serve Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.23'>Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.24'>Do you not consider what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which Jehovah has chosen, He has even cast them off? Thus they have despised My people, that they should no more be a nation before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.25'>Thus says Jehovah: If My covenant is not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of the heavens and the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.26'>then I will cast away the seed of Jacob, and David My servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will bring back their captives, and have mercy on them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.34'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.1'>The Word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion, and all the peoples, fought against Jerusalem and against all its cities; saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.2'>Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.3'>And you shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand. And your eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.4'>Yet hear the Word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah king of Judah, thus says Jehovah concerning you: You shall not die by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.5'>You shall die in peace; and as the burnings of incense for your fathers, the former kings which were before you, so they shall burn incense for you. And they shall lament for you, saying, Ah, lord! For I have spoken the Word, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.6'>Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.7'>when the king of Babylons army fought against Jerusalem and against all the remaining cities of Judah; against Lachish, and against Azekah; for these fortified cities remained of the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.8'>The Word that came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.9'>that each man should let his male slave, and each man his female slave, if they were a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, to go free; that no one should keep a Jewish brother enslaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.10'>And all the rulers obeyed, and all the people who had entered into the covenant allowed them to go free, each man his male slave, and each man his female slave, so that no one should be enslaved among them any more; and they obeyed and let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.11'>But afterward they changed their minds and caused the slaves and slave women whom they had let go free, to return! And they subjected them as slaves and slave women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.12'>Therefore the Word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.13'>Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.14'>At the end of seven years let each man free his brother, a Hebrew, who has been sold to him. And when he has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you. But your fathers did not heed me, nor extend their ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.15'>And you had turned today, and had done what was right in My eyes proclaiming liberty, each man to his neighbor. And you had made a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.16'>But you turned and violated My name, and each man caused his slave, and each man his slave woman, whom you had set free to do as they pleased, to return. And you brought them back into bondage to be slaves and slave women to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.17'>Therefore thus says Jehovah: You have not heeded Me to proclaim liberty each man to his brother, and each man to his neighbor! Behold, I proclaim liberty for you, says Jehovah, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine. And I will cause you to be an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.18'>And I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not done the words of the covenant which they made before Me when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.34.20'>I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life. And their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.21'>And I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, and his rulers, into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylons army, who have withdrawn from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.22'>Behold, I will command, says Jehovah, and cause them to return to this city. And they shall fight against it and capture it, and burn it with fire. And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.36.5'>And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am confined. I cannot go into the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.6'>Therefore you go, and read from the scroll which you have written at my mouth, the Words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in Jehovahs house on the day of the fast. And also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.7'>It may be that they will present their supplication before Jehovah, and will turn back, each one from his evil way. For great is the anger and the fury that Jehovah has pronounced against this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.8'>And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from the book, the Words of Jehovah in the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.9'>And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before Jehovah to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.10'>And Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah, in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entrance to the New Gate of the house of Jehovah, in the ears of all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.11'>When Michaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the Words of Jehovah from the book,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.12'>he then went down to the kings house, into the scribes room. And, lo, all the rulers sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.13'>Then Michaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.14'>Therefore all the rulers sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take the scroll in your hand from which you have read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.15'>And they said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.16'>And it happened when they had heard all the words, that they turned to one another in fear and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.17'>And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write all these words at his mouth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.18'>Then Baruch answered them, He spoke all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.19'>And the rulers said to Baruch, Go hide yourselves, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.20'>And they went in to the king, into the court. But they laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.21'>So the king sent Jehudi to bring the scroll. And he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the rulers who stood beside the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.22'>And the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, the fire burning in the hearth before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.23'>And it happened, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that he cut it with the scribes knife and threw it into the fire in the hearth, until all the scroll was burned up in the hearth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.24'>Yet the king and all his servants who heard these words were not afraid, nor did they tear their garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.25'>But Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had entreated the king that he should not burn the scroll, but he would not consent to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.26'>And the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But Jehovah hid them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.27'>Then the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, after the king had burned the scroll and the words which Baruch had written at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.28'>Take for yourself another scroll, and write in it all the former Words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.29'>And you shall say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus says Jehovah: You have burned this scroll, saying, Why have you written in it, saying that the king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause man and beast to be annihilated from there?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.30'>Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David. And his dead body shall be cast out into the heat of the day, and the frost of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.31'>And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity. And I will bring upon them, and upon the people of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have spoken against them; but they have not given heed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.32'>Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote in it at the mouth of Jeremiah all the Words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many words like them were added to them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.37.18'>Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, What have I offended against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?</verse>

For this man does not seek the welfare of this people, but their harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.5'>Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand. For the king cannot do a thing against you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.38.24'>Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.25'>But if the rulers hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you and say to you, Declare to us now what you have said to the king, and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us, and we will not put you to death;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.44.22'>Yes, so that Jehovah could no longer hold back because of the evil of your doings, because of the abominations which you have done! Therefore your land is a waste, and a wonder, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.44.23'>Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, nor walked in His Law, nor in His statutes, nor did you walk in His testimonies, therefore this evil has happened to you, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.44.24'>Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, Hear the Word of Jehovah, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.44.27'>Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good. And all the men of Judah in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there is an end to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.44.28'>Yet a small number that escapes the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah; and all the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, shall know whose word shall stand, Mine or theirs.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.9'>We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed. Forsake her and let us go, each one into his own land; for her judgment reaches to the heavens and is lifted up to the skies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.10'>Jehovah has brought forth our righteousness; come and let us declare in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.11'>Polish the arrows; gather the shields. Jehovah has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes. For His plan is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance of His temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.12'>Set up the banner on the walls of Babylon; make the guard strong; set up the watchmen; prepare the ambushes. For Jehovah has both planned and done that which He spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.13'>O you who live on many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, and the measure of your unjust gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.14'>Jehovah of Hosts has sworn by Himself, saying, Surely I will fill you with men as with locust caterpillars; and they shall lift up a shout against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.15'>He has made the earth by His power; He has established the world by His wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by His understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.16'>When He utters His voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and He causes the mists to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings with rain and brings forth the wind out of His treasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.17'>Every man is stupid in knowledge; every refiner is put to shame by graven images. For his molten image is deception, and there is no breath in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.18'>They are vanity, the work of errors; in the time of their judgment they shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.19'>The Portion of Jacob is not like them; for He is the Former of all things, and Israel is the offshoot of His inheritance. Jehovah of Hosts is His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.20'>You are My battle-ax and weapons of war; for with you I will shatter nations; and with you I will destroy kingdoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.21'>And with you I will shatter the horse and his rider; and with you I will shatter the chariot and his rider.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.22'>Also with you I will shatter man and woman; and with you I will shatter old and young; and with you I will shatter the young man and the maiden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.23'>I will also shatter the shepherd and his flock with you. And with you I will shatter the farmer and his yoke of oxen; and with you I will shatter governors and rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.24'>And I will recompense unto Babylon, and unto all the inhabitants of Chaldea, all the evil that they have done in Zion in your eyes, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.25'>Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, says Jehovah, who destroys all the earth. And I will stretch out My hand upon you and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burnt mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.26'>And they shall not take a stone from you for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but you shall be a waste forever, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.27'>Set up a banner in the land; blow the shofar among the nations; prepare the nations against her. Call the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz together against her; appoint a commander against her. Cause the horses to come up as the bristling caterpillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.28'>Consecrate nations against her, with the kings of the Medes, her governors and all her rulers, and all the land of his realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.29'>And the land shall tremble and writhe. For every purpose of Jehovah shall be fulfilled against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a waste without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.30'>The mighty men of Babylon have stopped fighting; they have remained in strongholds; their might has failed. They became like women; they have burned her dwellings; the bars of her gates are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.31'>A runner shall run to meet a runner, and a herald to a herald, to report to the king of Babylon that his city is captured from end to end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.32'>and that the passages are blocked; and they have burned the reeds with fire, and the men of war are frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.33'>For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor, and it is time to thresh her. Yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.34'>Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me; he has crushed me; he has made me an empty vessel. He has swallowed me up like a dragon; he has filled his stomach with my delicacies; he has rinsed me out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.35'>The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, the inhabitant of Zion shall say. And, My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, Jerusalem shall say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.36'>Therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will plead your case and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.37'>And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, a horror and a hissing, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.38'>They shall roar together like lions; they shall growl like lions cubs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.39'>In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunk so that they may rejoice and sleep a never-ending sleep, and not wake up, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.40'>I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with the male goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.41'>How Sheshach is captured! And how the praise of the whole earth is seized! How Babylon has become a waste among the nations!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.42'>The sea has come up over Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of its waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.43'>Her cities are desolate, a dry land and a wilderness, a land in which no man dwells, nor does any son of man pass by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.44'>And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up. And the nations shall not flow together to him any more; yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.45'>My people, go out of her midst; and let each man deliver his soul from the fierce anger of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.46'>And let not your heart faint, nor fear the rumor that shall be heard in the land. The report shall come in a year. And after that a report shall come in another year; and violence shall be in the land, ruler against ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.47'>Therefore, behold, the days are coming that I will punish the graven images of Babylon. And all her land shall be put to shame, and all her slain shall fall in her midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.48'>And the heavens and the earth, and all that is in them, shall shout for joy over Babylon; for the plunderers shall come to her from the north, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.49'>As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon the slain of all the earth shall fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.50'>You who have escaped the sword, go away! Do not stand still! Remember Jehovah from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.51'>We are confounded because we have heard reproach. Shame has covered our faces, for strangers have come into the sanctuaries of Jehovahs house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.52'>Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will punish her graven images, and throughout all her land the wounded shall groan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.53'>Though Babylon should mount up to the heavens, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet plunderers shall come unto her from Me, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.54'>The sound of a cry comes from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.55'>because Jehovah is plundering Babylon, and the loud voice has been blotted out of her. Her waves are turbulent like great waters, they have made a great roaring sound;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.56'>because the plunderer has come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are captured. Every one of their bows is broken, for Jehovah, the Mighty God of recompenses, makes good the recompense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.57'>And I will make her rulers drunk, along with her wise ones, her governors, and her officials, and her mighty men. And they shall sleep a never-ending sleep and not wake up, says the King whose name is Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.58'>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be completely broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the nation shall labor in vain, and the people shall be in the fire, and they shall be weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.59'>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And Seraiah was a quiet leader.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.60'>So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that would come upon Babylon, all these words that are written against Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.61'>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you arrive in Babylon, and have seen, and have read all these words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.62'>then you shall say, O Jehovah, You have spoken against this place to cut it off, so that no one shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be a waste forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.63'>And it shall be when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.64'>And you shall say, In this way shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise, from the evil that I will bring upon her. And they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.52'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.1'>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mothers name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.2'>And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.3'>For although the anger of Jehovah was upon Jerusalem and Judah (until He had cast them out from His presence), Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.4'>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it and built siege walls against it all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.5'>So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.6'>And in the fourth month, in the ninth of the month, the famine was so severe in the city, so that there was no food for the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.7'>Then the city was broken into, and all the men of war fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the kings garden. (And the Chaldeans lay in wait all around the city.) And they went by the way of the plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.8'>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And all his army was scattered from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.9'>So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon, to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he passed judgment against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.10'>And the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also killed all the rulers of Judah in Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.11'>And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah. And the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and brought him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.12'>And in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month, (which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, who served the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.13'>And he burned the house of Jehovah, and the kings house. And he burned with fire all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.14'>And all the army of the Chaldeans, with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.15'>And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took captive some of the poor of the people, and the rest of the people who remained in the city, and those who deserted, who had defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.16'>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.17'>Also the Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases, and the bronze sea in the house of Jehovah, and carried all the bronze from them to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.18'>They also took away the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.19'>And the captain of the guard took away the basins, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the spoons, and the cups; what was gold, in gold; and what was silver, in silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.20'>The two pillars, one sea, and twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which King Solomon had made in the house of Jehovah; the bronze of all these vessels was without weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.21'>And concerning the pillars: the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits. And a measuring line of twelve cubits went around it, and its thickness was four fingers; it was hollow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.22'>And a capital of bronze was on it. And the height of one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capitals all around, all of bronze. The second pillar also, and the pomegranates, were like these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.23'>And there were ninety-six pomegranates on a side; all the pomegranates on the network were a hundred all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.24'>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.25'>He also took out of the city an official who was in charge of the men of war; and seven men from those who were close to the king, who were found in the city; and the chief scribe of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the middle of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.26'>And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.27'>And the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was taken captive out of his own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.28'>These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar took captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.29'>in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he took captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.30'>in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took captive seven hundred and forty-five persons of the Jews. All the persons were four thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.31'>And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty-fifth of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him out of prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.32'>and spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.33'>And he changed from his prison garments, and he ate bread before him all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.34'>And as for his allowance: a continual allowance was given him from the king of Babylon, the matter day by day, until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</verse>
