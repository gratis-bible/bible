      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>And Judah begot Pharez and Zarah by Tamar, Pharez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Aram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>And Aram begot Amminadab, Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>And Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, Boaz begot Obed by Ruth, Obed begot Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse begot David the king. David the king begot Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>And Solomon begot Rehoboam, Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>And Asa begot Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>And Uzziah begot Jotham, Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>And Hezekiah begot Manasseh, Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>And Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers about the time they were carried away to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>And Zerubbabel begot Abiud, Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>And Azor begot Sadok, Sadok begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>And Eliud begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, from David until the deportation into Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the deportation into Babylon until the Christ are fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this way: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child from the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>But Joseph her husband, being just, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But while he was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which is translated, God with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name JESUS.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>saying, Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to do homage to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>So they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are not the least among the leaders of Judah; for out of you shall come One leading Who will shepherd My people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, asked of them exactly what time the star appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, Go and search carefully for the young Child, and when you find Him, bring back word to me, that I may come and do homage to Him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And when they had come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and did homage to Him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being warned in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed for their own country another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>And when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, take the Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod is about to seek the young Child in order to destroy Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed into Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt I called My Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was greatly enraged; and he sent forth and put to death all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired from the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>saying, Arise, take the young Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young Childs life are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And he arose, took the young Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days John the Immerser came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven has drawn near!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>And John himself was clothed in camels hair, with a leather waistband around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them, Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Therefore bring forth fruits worthy of repentance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and do not think to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>And now already the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore any tree which does not bear good fruit is cut off and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed immerse you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>whose winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor, and gather His wheat into the granary; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus comes from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be immersed by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John tried to prevent Him, saying, I need to be immersed by You, and do You come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answered and said to him, Permit it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allowed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And when He had been immersed, Jesus went up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And behold a voice out of heaven, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And when the tempter came to Him, he said, If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But He answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that comes forth from the mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil takes Him up into the holy city, and sets Him on the wing of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and says to Him, If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: He shall give His angels charge concerning you, and, in their hands they shall bear you up, that you may not dash your foot against a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, It is written again, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again, the devil takes Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and shows Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>And he says to Him, All these things I will give to You if You will fall down and do homage to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus said to him, Go away, Satan! For it has been written, You shall do homage to the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up to prison, He withdrew into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people who sat in darkness have seen a great Light, and upon those sitting in the region and shadow of death, Light has sprung up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven has drawn near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And He says to them, Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And they immediately left their nets and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And going on from there, He saw two other brothers, Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And He called them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus went around all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all the sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And great multitudes followed Him; from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>And seeing the multitudes, He went up into a mountain, and when He was seated His disciples came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>And He opened His mouth and taught them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed are they who have been persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Blessed are you when they shall revile and persecute you, and shall say every evil word against you falsely because of Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in Heaven, for in this manner they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a grain measure, but on a lampstand, and it shines for all who are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Let your light so shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For truly I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the Law till all is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whoever therefore relaxes one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of Heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, Empty head! shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says, You fool! shall be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Truly I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>And if your right eye snares you into sin, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, and not your whole body be cast into Gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if your right hand snares you into sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, and not your whole body be cast into Gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>Furthermore it has been said, Whoever puts away his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say to you that whoever puts away his wife for any reason except sexual perversion causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Again, you have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by Heaven, for it is Gods throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Nor shall you swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your word be Yes, yes; No, no. For whatever is more than these is from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I tell you, Do not resist evil. But whoever hits you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And if anyone wants to sue you and take away your tunic, let him have your cloak also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to him who asks of you, and from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who abuse you and persecute you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>that you may become sons of your Father in Heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not also the tax collectors so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in Heaven is perfect.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>Take heed that you do not do your deeds of mercy before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>Therefore, when you do a deed of mercy, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have praise from men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But when you do a deed of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand does,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>that your deed of mercy may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>And when you pray, do not babble vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>In this manner, therefore, pray: Our Father in Heaven, Holy is Your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>Give us this day our bread sufficient for this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.12'>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.13'>And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.14'>For if you forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.15'>But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.17'>But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.18'>so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.19'>Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves dig through and steal;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.20'>but lay up for yourselves treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not dig through and steal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.21'>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.22'>The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.23'>But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.24'>No one is able to serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. It is not possible to serve God and mammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>Therefore I say to you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.26'>Observe the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your Heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.27'>Which of you by being anxious is able to add one cubit to his stature?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.28'>So why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.29'>and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.30'>Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we wear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.32'>For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your Heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.33'>But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.7'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.1'>Judge not, that you be not judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.2'>For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever gauge you measure, it will be measured back to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.3'>And why do you look at the twig in your brothers eye, but do not consider the beam in your own eye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.4'>Or how can you say to your brother, Let me remove the twig from your eye; and behold, a beam is in your own eye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.5'>Hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the twig from your brothers eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.6'>Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.7'>Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.8'>For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.9'>Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.10'>Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.11'>If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in Heaven give good things to those who ask Him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.12'>Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.13'>Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many entering in through it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.14'>Because narrow is the gate and distressing is the way which leads unto life, and there are few who find it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.15'>Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.16'>You will know them from their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.17'>Even so, every good tree produces excellent fruit, but a corrupt tree produces evil fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.18'>A good tree is not able to produce evil fruit, nor is a corrupt tree able to produce excellent fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.19'>Every tree that does not produce excellent fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.20'>Therefore from their fruits you will know them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.21'>Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of Heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.22'>Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many works of power in Your name?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.23'>And then I will declare to them, I never knew you; depart from Me, you who work out lawlessness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.24'>Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.25'>and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.26'>And everyone who hears these sayings of Mine, and does not do them, will be likened to a foolish man who built his house on the sand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.27'>and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house; and it fell. And great was its fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.28'>And so it was, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the multitudes were astonished at His doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.29'>for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.8'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.1'>When He had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.2'>And behold, a leper came and did homage to Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You have the power to make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed. Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>And Jesus said to him, See that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>And when Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, begging Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>saying, Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, being terribly tormented.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>And Jesus said to him, I will come and heal him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>And I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.12'>But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>Then Jesus said to the centurion, Go your way; and as you have believed, so let it be done for you. And his servant was healed that same hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>And when Jesus had come into Peters house, He saw his wifes mother lying sick with a fever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>And He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed everyone who was sick,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>And when Jesus saw great multitudes around Him, He gave a command to depart to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>And a certain scribe came and said to Him, Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.21'>And another of His disciples said to Him, Lord, let me first go away and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.22'>But Jesus said to him, Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.23'>And when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.24'>And, behold, a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.25'>And His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, Lord, save us! We are perishing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>And He said to them, Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>So the men marveled, saying, Of what sort is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>And when He had come to the other side, to the country of the Gergesenes, there met Him two demon-possessed men, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with You, Jesus, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>And a good way off from them there was a herd of many swine feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>So the demons begged Him, saying, If You cast us out, allow us to go away into the herd of swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>And He said to them, Go. So when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine. And, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and perished in the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>Then those who kept them fled; and they went away into the city and told everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to depart out of their borders.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.9'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.1'>So He got into a boat, crossed over, and came to His own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.2'>And behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, Son, be of good courage; your sins are forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>And at once some of the scribes said within themselves, This Man blasphemes!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why do you think evil in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.5'>For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Arise and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.6'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins; then He said to the paralytic, Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>And he arose and departed to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>And when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, Follow Me. So he arose and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>And it happened, as Jesus sat at the table in the house, that behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Him and His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>But when Jesus heard it, He said to them, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>But go and learn what this means: I desire mercy and not sacrifice. For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.17'>Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins, or else the wineskins break, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.18'>While He spoke these things to them, behold, a ruler came and did homage to Him, saying, My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her and she will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.19'>So Jesus arose and followed him, and so did His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>And behold, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.21'>For she said within herself, If only I may touch His garment, I shall be made well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.22'>But Jesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, Be of good courage, daughter; your faith has made you well. And the woman was made well from that hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.23'>And when Jesus came into the rulers house, and saw the flute players and the crowd wailing loudly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.24'>He said to them, Make room, for the girl has not died, but is sleeping. And they ridiculed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.25'>But when the crowd was put outside, He went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.26'>And the report of this went out into all that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.27'>And when Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, Son of David, have mercy on us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.28'>And when He had come into the house, the blind men came to Him. And Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? And they said to Him, Yes, Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.29'>Then He touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith let it be to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.30'>And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly ordered them, saying, See that no one knows it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.31'>But when they had departed, they spread the news about Him in all that country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>And as they went out, behold, they brought to Him a man, mute and demon-possessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.33'>And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never seen like this in Israel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.34'>But the Pharisees said, He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.35'>And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.36'>But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.37'>And He said to His disciples, The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.38'>Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.10'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.1'>And when He had called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every sickness and every disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.2'>Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.3'>Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; Jacob the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.4'>Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.5'>These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them, saying: Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.6'>But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.7'>And as you go, preach, saying, The kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.8'>Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.9'>Provide neither gold nor silver nor copper in your money belts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.10'>nor bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staffs; for a worker is worthy of his food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.11'>And into whatever city or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there till you go out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.12'>And when you go into a house, greet it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.13'>If the house is truly worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.14'>And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.15'>Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.16'>Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.17'>But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and scourge you in their synagogues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.18'>And you will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.19'>But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you should speak, for it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.20'>for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.21'>And brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and put them to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.22'>And you will be hated by everyone on account of My name. But he who endures to the end will be kept safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.23'>But when they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For truly I say to you, you will not have finished going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.13'>Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.14'>And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says: Hearing you will hear and shall not at all understand, and seeing you will see and by no means perceive;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.16'>But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.17'>for truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.18'>Therefore hear the parable of the sower:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.19'>When anyone hears the Word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, then the wicked one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is that which was sown by the wayside.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.24'>Another parable He put forth to them, saying: The kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.25'>but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.30'>Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.31'>Another parable He put forth to them, saying: The kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.32'>which indeed is the smallest of all the seeds; but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.33'>Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of Heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.34'>All these things Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables; and without a parable He did not speak to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.35'>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things kept secret from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.36'>Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.37'>He answered and said to them: He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.38'>The field is the world, the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of the wicked one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.39'>The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.40'>Therefore as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.41'>The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all the stumbling blocks, and those who practice lawlessness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.42'>and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.43'>Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.44'>Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells everything he has and buys that field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.45'>Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.46'>who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold everything he had and bought it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.47'>Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some of every kind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.48'>which, when it was full, they drew to shore; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the rotten away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.49'>So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go forth, separate the wicked from among the righteous,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.53'>Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, that He departed from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.54'>And when He had come to His own country, He taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, Where did this Man get this wisdom and these mighty works?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.2'>and said to his servants, This is John the Immerser; he is risen from the dead, and therefore these works of power are at work in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.3'>For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philips wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.4'>Because John had said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.5'>And although he wanted to put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.6'>But when Herods birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.7'>Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.8'>So she, having been instructed by her mother, said, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Immerser.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.9'>And the king was sorry; nevertheless, because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he commanded it to be given to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.10'>So he sent and had John beheaded in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.11'>And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.12'>And his disciples came and took away the body and buried it, and went and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.13'>When Jesus heard it, He withdrew from there by boat to a deserted place by Himself. And when the multitudes heard it, they followed Him on foot out of the cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.14'>And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.15'>And when it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.16'>But Jesus said to them, They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.17'>And they said to Him, We have here only five loaves and two fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.18'>He said, Bring them here to Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.19'>And He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.20'>So they all ate and were filled, and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.21'>Now those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.22'>And immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, while He sent the multitudes away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.23'>And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up into the mountain by Himself to pray. And when evening came, He was there alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.24'>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.25'>And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.26'>And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost! And they cried out for fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.27'>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.28'>And Peter answered Him and said, Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.29'>So He said, Come. And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.30'>But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, Lord, save me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.31'>And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, and said to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.32'>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.33'>Then those who were in the boat came and did homage to Him, saying, Truly You are the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.34'>And when they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.35'>And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent out into all that surrounding region, brought to Him all who were sick,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.36'>and begged Him that they might only touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched it were made completely well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.15'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.1'>Then the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.2'>Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.3'>He answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by reason of your tradition?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.4'>For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him die the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.5'>But you say, Whoever says to his father or mother, Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.6'>and he does not honor his father or mother. Thus you have voided the commandment of God by your tradition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.7'>Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.8'>These people draw near to Me with their mouth, and honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.9'>And in vain they revere Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.10'>And when He had called the multitude to Himself, He said to them, Hear and understand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.11'>Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.12'>Then His disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.13'>But He answered and said, Every plant which My Heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.14'>Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into the ditch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.15'>Then Peter answered and said to Him, Explain this parable to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.16'>So Jesus said, Are you also still without understanding?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.17'>Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated into the sewer?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.18'>But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.19'>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual perversions, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.20'>These are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.21'>Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.22'>And behold, a woman of Canaan came from those borders and cried out to Him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is grievously demon-possessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.23'>But He answered her not a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, Send her away, for she cries out after us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.24'>But He answered and said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.25'>Then she came and did homage to Him, saying, Lord, help me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.26'>But He answered and said, It is not good to take the childrens bread and throw it to the little dogs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.27'>But she said, Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.28'>Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire. And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.29'>And Jesus departed from there, came beside the Sea of Galilee, and went up into the mountain and sat down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.30'>And great multitudes came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others; and they cast them down at Jesus feet, and He healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.31'>So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.32'>Then Jesus called His disciples to Himself and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, that they not faint on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.33'>And His disciples said to Him, Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed such a great multitude?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.34'>Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven, and a few little fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.35'>So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.36'>And He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks, broke them and gave them to His disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.37'>So they all ate and were filled, and they took up seven large baskets full of the fragments that were left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.38'>And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.39'>And He sent away the multitude, got into the boat, and came to the borders of Magdala.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.16'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.1'>Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and tempting Him, asked that He would show them a sign out of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.2'>He answered and said to them, When it is evening you say, It will be fair weather, for the sky is red;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.3'>and in the morning, It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening. Hypocrites! You know how to discern the face of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.4'>A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. And He left them and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.5'>And when His disciples had come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.6'>Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.7'>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.8'>But Jesus, being aware of it, said to them, O you of little faith, why do you reason among yourselves because you have brought no bread?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.9'>Do you not yet understand, or remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.10'>Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many large baskets you took up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.11'>How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread, but to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.12'>Then they understood that He did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.13'>When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.14'>So they said, Some say John the Immerser, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.15'>He said to them, But who do you say that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.16'>Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.17'>And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.18'>And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this Rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against It.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.19'>And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be, having been bound in Heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be, having been loosed in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.20'>Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.21'>From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that it was necessary for Him to go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.22'>Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, Far be it from You, Lord; this shall never be to You!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.23'>But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan! You are a snare to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.24'>Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.25'>For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.26'>For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.27'>For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his practice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.28'>Truly I say to you, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.17'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.1'>And after six days Jesus took Peter, Jacob, and John his brother, and led them up into a high mountain by themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.2'>and He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.3'>And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.4'>Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, let us make here three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.5'>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and behold a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.6'>And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were greatly terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.7'>And Jesus came and touched them and said, Arise, and do not be terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.8'>And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.9'>Now as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.10'>And His disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.11'>And Jesus answered and said to them, Indeed, Elijah is coming first and will restore all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.12'>But I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. Likewise the Son of Man is also about to suffer under them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.13'>Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them of John the Immerser.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.14'>And when they had come to the multitude, a man came to Him, kneeling down to Him and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.15'>Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is lunatic and suffers miserably; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.16'>And I brought him to Your disciples, but they were not able to cure him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.17'>Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.18'>And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him; and the child was cured from that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.19'>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, Why could we not cast it out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.20'>And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief; for truly I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.21'>However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.22'>And while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.23'>and they will kill Him, and the third day He will be raised up. And they were exceedingly sorrowful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.24'>And when they had come to Capernaum, those who received the tribute came to Peter and said, Does your Teacher not pay the tribute?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.25'>He said, Yes. And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from strangers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.26'>Peter said to Him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then the sons are free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.27'>Nevertheless, that we not offend them, go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give it to them for Me and you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.18'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.1'>At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greater in the kingdom of Heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.2'>And Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in the midst of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.3'>and said, Truly, I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.4'>Therefore whoever humbles himself as this little child is greater in the kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.5'>Whoever receives one little child like this in My name receives Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.6'>But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.7'>Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks, for stumbling blocks must come; but woe to that man by whom the stumbling block comes!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.8'>If your hand or foot entices you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the everlasting fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.9'>And if your eye entices you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into the fire of Gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.10'>Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in Heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.11'>For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.12'>What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.13'>And if he should find it, truly I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.14'>Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in Heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.15'>Moreover if your brother sins against you, go and reprove him between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.16'>But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.17'>And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church. But if he refuses to hear the church, let him be to you like a foreigner and a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.18'>Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be, having been bound in Heaven; and whatever you loose on earth will be, having been loosed in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.19'>Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will come to pass for them from My Father in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.20'>For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.21'>Then Peter came to Him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.22'>Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Until seven times, but until seventy times seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.23'>Therefore the kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.24'>And when he had begun to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.25'>But as he was not able to pay, his master commanded that he be sold, also his wife and children and everything he had, and that payment be made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.26'>The servant therefore fell down before him, saying, Master, have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.27'>Then the master of that servant was moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.28'>But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.29'>So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.30'>And he would not, but went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.31'>So when his fellow servants saw what had been done, they were very grieved, and came and told their master all that had been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.32'>Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.33'>Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.34'>And his master was angry, and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay every bit that was due to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.35'>Thus My Heavenly Father also will do to you if each of you, from his heart, does not forgive his brother his trespasses.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.19'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.1'>Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings, that He departed from Galilee and came to the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.2'>And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.3'>The Pharisees also came to Him, testing Him, and saying to Him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for just any reason?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.4'>And He answered and said to them, Have you not read that He who made them at the beginning made them male and female,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.5'>and said, For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.6'>So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has yoked together, let not man separate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.7'>They said to Him, Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.8'>He said to them, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.9'>And I say to you, whoever puts away his wife, except for sexual perversion, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.10'>His disciples said to Him, If such is the case of the man with his wife, it is not good to marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.11'>But He said to them, Not all have room to receive this saying, but only those to whom it has been given:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.12'>For there are eunuchs who were born thus from their mothers womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of Heaven. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.13'>Then little children were brought to Him that He might lay His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.14'>But Jesus said, Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.15'>And He laid His hands on them and departed from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.16'>And behold, one came and said to Him, Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.17'>So He said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.18'>He said to Him, Which? Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.19'>Honor your father and your mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.20'>The young man said to Him, All these things I have kept from my youth. What do I still lack?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.21'>Jesus said to him, If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven; and come, follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.22'>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had many possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.23'>Then Jesus said to His disciples, Truly, I say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.24'>And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.25'>When His disciples heard it, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.26'>But Jesus looked at them and said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.27'>Then Peter answered and said to Him, Behold, we have left everything and followed You. What then will there be for us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.28'>And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.29'>And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for My name, shall receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.20'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.1'>For the kingdom of Heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.2'>And when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.3'>And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.4'>and said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. So they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.5'>Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.6'>And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why do you stand here idle all day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.7'>They said to him, Because no one hired us. He said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.8'>So when evening had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers and give them their wages, beginning with the last to the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.9'>And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.10'>But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received each a denarius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.11'>And when they had received it, they murmured against the landowner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.12'>saying, These last men have worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.13'>But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.14'>Take what is yours and go your way. I wish to give to this last man the same as to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.15'>Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own things? Or is your eye evil because I am good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.16'>So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.17'>And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples aside on the road and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.18'>Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.19'>and deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify. And the third day He will rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.20'>Then the mother of Zebedees sons came to Him with her sons, bowing and asking something from Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.21'>And He said to her, What do you wish? She said to Him, Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on the left, in Your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.22'>But Jesus answered and said, You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with? They said to Him, We are able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.23'>And He said to them, You will indeed drink My cup, and be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with; but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.24'>And when the ten heard it, they were indignant about the two brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.25'>But Jesus called them to Himself and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.26'>But it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.27'>And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.28'>just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.29'>And as they went out of Jericho, a great multitude followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.30'>And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.31'>And the multitude warned them that they should be quiet; but they cried out all the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.32'>And Jesus stood still and called them, and said, What do you want Me to do for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.33'>They said to Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.34'>So Jesus had compassion and touched their eyes. And immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.21'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.1'>And when they drew near Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.2'>saying to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Loose them and bring them to Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.3'>And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them, and immediately he will send them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.4'>All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.5'>Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King is coming to you, meek, and sitting on a donkey, a colt, the foal of a donkey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.6'>So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.7'>And they led the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.8'>And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road; others cut down branches from the trees and spread them in the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.9'>And the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.10'>And when He had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.11'>And the multitudes said, This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.12'>And Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.13'>And He said to them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.14'>And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.15'>But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! they were indignant</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.16'>and said to Him, Do You hear what these are saying? And Jesus said to them, Yes. Have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.17'>And He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.18'>Now in the morning, as He returned to the city, He hungered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.19'>And seeing a fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it but leaves, and said to it, Let fruit no longer grow on you forever. And immediately the fig tree dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.20'>And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How quickly the fig tree has dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.21'>So Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, Be removed and be cast into the sea, it will happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.22'>And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.23'>And when He came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached Him as He was teaching, and said, By what authority do You do these things? And who gave You this authority?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.24'>And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.25'>The immersion of John; where was it from? From Heaven or from men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From Heaven, He will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.26'>But if we say, From men, we fear the multitude, for everyone holds John as a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.27'>So they answered Jesus and said, We do not know. And He said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.28'>But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, Son, go, work today in my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.29'>He answered and said, I will not, but afterward he regretted it and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.30'>And he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir, but he did not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.31'>Which of the two did the will of his father? They said to Him, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly, I say to you that tax collectors and harlots enter the kingdom of God before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.32'>For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but tax collectors and harlots believed him; and when you saw it, you did not afterward repent and believe him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.33'>Hear another parable: There was a certain landowner who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a winepress in it and built a tower. And he leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.34'>Now when the season of fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers, that they might receive its fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.35'>And the vinedressers took his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.36'>Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did likewise to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.37'>Then last of all he sent his son to them, saying, They will respect my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.38'>But when the vinedressers saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.39'>So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.40'>Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.41'>They said to Him, He will destroy those wicked men miserably, and lease his vineyard to other vinedressers who will deliver to him the fruits in their seasons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.42'>Jesus said to them, Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner. This was the Lords doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.43'>Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation producing the fruits of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.44'>And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will crush him to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.45'>Now when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.46'>But when they sought to lay hands on Him, they feared the multitudes, because they held Him as a prophet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.22'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.1'>And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.2'>The kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king who made a wedding feast for his son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.3'>and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast; and they were not willing to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.4'>Again, he sent out other servants, saying, Tell those being invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.5'>But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his business.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.6'>And the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.7'>But when the king heard about it, he was angry. And he sent out his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.8'>Then he said to his servants, The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.9'>Therefore go into the highways, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.10'>So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all whom they found, both evil and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.11'>But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.12'>So he said to him, Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.13'>And the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.14'>For many are called, but few are chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.15'>Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entangle Him in His words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.16'>And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that You are true, and teach the way of God in truth; nor do You care about anyone, for You do not regard the person of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.17'>Tell us, therefore, what do You think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.18'>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why do you test Me, hypocrites?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.19'>Show Me the tribute money. So they brought Him a denarius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.20'>And He said to them, Whose image and inscription is this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.21'>They said to Him, Caesars. And He said to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.22'>When they had heard these words, they marveled, and left Him and went their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.23'>The same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.24'>saying: Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.25'>Now there were with us seven brothers. The first died after he had married, and having no seed, left his wife to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.26'>Likewise the second also, and the third, even to the seventh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.27'>Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.28'>Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.29'>Jesus answered and said to them, You are in error, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.30'>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels of God in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.31'>But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.32'>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.33'>And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at His doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.34'>But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.35'>Then one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.36'>Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.37'>Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.38'>This is the first and great commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.39'>And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.40'>On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.41'>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.43'>He said to them, How then does David in the Spirit call Him Lord, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.44'>The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.45'>If David then calls Him Lord, how is He his son?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and each of them began to say to Him, Lord, it is not I is it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>He answered and said, He who dips his hand with Me in the dish will betray Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of Man indeed goes just as it is written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It had been good for that man if he was never born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>Then Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, Rabbi, it is not I is it? He said to him, You have said it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink all of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>For this is My blood of the New Covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>But I say to you, I will not at all drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Fathers kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then Jesus said to them, All of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, for it is written: I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after I have been raised, I will go before you into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>Peter answered and said to Him, Even if all are made to stumble because of You, I will never be made to stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him, Truly, I say to you that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter said to Him, Even if I have to die with You, I will not at all deny You! And so said all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, Sit here while I go and pray over there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and He began to be sorrowful and in extreme anguish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>And He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death. Stay here and watch with Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>And He came to the disciples and found them asleep, and said to Peter, What? Were you not able to watch with Me one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray, that you not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>So He left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then He came to His disciples and said to them, Sleep on and rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Arise, let us be going. Behold, My betrayer is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I kiss, He is the One; seize Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And immediately he went up to Jesus and said, Greetings, Rabbi; and kissed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>But Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you here? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>But Jesus said to him, Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Or do you think that I am not able now to pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, Have you come out, as against a robber, to take Me with swords and clubs? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this is happening that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>And those who had laid hold of Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Peter followed Him at a distance to the high priests courtyard. And he went in and sat with the servants to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>Now the chief priests, the elders, and all the council sought false testimony against Jesus to put Him to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>but found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>and said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And the high priest arose and said to Him, Do You answer nothing? What is it these men bear witness against You?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, I adjure You by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus said to him, You said it. Nevertheless, I say to you, Hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard His blasphemy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What is your opinion? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spat in His face and beat Him with the fist; and others slapped Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who struck You?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied it before them all, saying, I do not know what you are saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And when he had gone out to the porch, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, This fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>And a little later those who stood by came up and said to Peter, Surely you also are one of them, for your speech betrays you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to curse and swear, saying, I do not know the Man! And immediately a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus who had said to him, Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>And when they had bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Judas, His betrayer, seeing that He was condemned, repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>saying, I have sinned by betraying innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? You see to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>And the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>And they took counsel and bought with them the potters field, to bury strangers in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was valued, whom they of the children of Israel valued,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>and gave them for the potters field, as the Lord directed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>And Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor questioned Him, saying, Are You the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, It is as you say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to Him, Do You not hear how many things they witness against You?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>But He answered him not one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to releasing to the multitude one prisoner whom they wished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>And at that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>Therefore, when they had gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For he knew that they had delivered Him over because of envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that just Man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>The governor answered and said to them, Which of the two do you want me to release to you? They said, Barabbas!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate said to them, What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ? They all say to him, Let Him be crucified!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>And the governor said, Why, what evil has He done? But they cried out all the more, saying, Let Him be crucified!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but rather that a tumult was rising, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just Person. You see to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>And all the people answered and said, His blood be on us and on our children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released Barabbas to them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered Him to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>And when they had woven a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they bowed the knee before Him and mocked Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And they spat on Him, and took the reed and struck Him on the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And when they had mocked Him, they took the robe off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>Now as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. Him they compelled to bear His cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they gave Him vinegar mixed with gall to drink. But when He had tasted it, He would not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And they crucified Him, and divided His garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And sitting down, they kept watch over Him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And they put up over His head the accusation written against Him: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>And two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and another on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, You who destroys the temple and builds it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>Likewise the chief priests also, mocking with the scribes and elders, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>He saved others; He has no power to save Himself. If He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now if He will have Him; for He said, I am the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>Even the robbers who were crucified with Him reviled Him with the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>Some of those who stood there, when they heard that, said, This Man calls for Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>The rest said, Let be; let us see if Elijah will come to save Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>Then, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and coming out of the graves after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and were manifest to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>Now when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>And many women who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him, were there looking on from afar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jacob and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>And when evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself was also a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. And Pilate commanded the body to be given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and laid it in his new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>And on the next day, which followed the Day of Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered together to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>saying, Sir, we remember, while He was still alive, how that deceiver said, After three days I will rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Therefore, command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, that His disciples not come by night and steal Him away, and say to the people, He has risen from the dead. So the last deception will be worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, You have a guard; go your way, make it as secure as you know how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting the guard.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from Heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>And the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>And the angel answered and said to the women, Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and behold He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to report this to His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And as they went to bring word to His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, Greetings! And they came and held Him by the feet and did homage to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>And Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>saying, Say, His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>And if this comes to the governors ears, we will persuade him and make you free from anxiety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>And when they saw Him, they did homage to Him; but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority is given to Me in Heaven and on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>Go therefore and instruct all the nations, immersing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Amen.</verse>
