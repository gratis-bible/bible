      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>He was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not lay hold of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through Him might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and yet the world did not know Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those believing into His name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, This was He of whom I said, He who arrives after me appeared in history before me, for He existed before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the Law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? He said, I am not. Are you the Prophet? And he answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>Then they said to him, Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said: I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>Now those who were sent were from the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him, saying, Why then do you immerse if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, I immerse in water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>It is He who, arriving after me, appeared in history before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things were done in Bethabara beyond the Jordan, where John was immersing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day John sees Jesus coming toward him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is He of whom I said, After me arrives a Man who appeared in history before me, for He existed before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>I did not know Him; but that He should be revealed to Israel, therefore I come immersing in water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John bore witness, saying, I saw the Spirit descending out of Heaven like a dove, and He abode upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>I did not know Him, but He who sent me to immerse in water said to me, Upon whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, this is He who immerses in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>And looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, said to them, What do you seek? They said to Him, Rabbi (which is to say, when translated, Teacher), where are You staying?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He said to them, Come and see. They came and saw where He was staying, and remained with Him that day (now it was about the tenth hour).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peters brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which is translated, the Christ).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus looked at him, He said, You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas (which is translated, Peter).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The following day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee, and He found Philip and said to him, Follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law, and also the Prophets, wrote; Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael said to Him, From where do You know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered and said to Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see Heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>And both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And running out of wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus said to her, Woman, of what concern is that to Me and you? My hour has not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the servants, Whatever He says to you, do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now there were set there six stone waterpots, according to the manner of purification of the Jews, containing two or three measures each.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And He said to them, Draw some out now, and take it to the master of the feast. And they brought it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and he said to him, Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine, and when the guests have well drunk, then the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this He went down to Capernaum, He, His mother, His brothers, and His disciples; and they stayed there not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And when He had made a whip out of rope, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers money and overturned the tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And He said to those who sold doves, Take these things away from here! Do not make My Fathers house a house of merchandise!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>And His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for Your house has consumed Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>Then the Jews answered and said to Him, What sign do You show to us, since You do these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>Then the Jews said, It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But He was speaking of the temple of His body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>Therefore, when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them; and they believed the Scripture and the Word which Jesus had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name when they saw the signs which He did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew everyone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and had no need that anyone should bear witness of man, for He knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born from above, he is not able to see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? He is not able to enter a second time into his mothers womb and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The Spirit breathes where He wishes, and you hear His voice, but do not know where He comes from and where He goes. So is everyone who is born from the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered and said to him, Are you a teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak what We know and bear witness to what We have seen, and you do not receive Our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you Heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>No one has ascended to Heaven but He who came down from Heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>that everyone believing into Him should not perish but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone believing into Him should not perish but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God did not send His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>The one believing into Him is not judged; but the one not believing is judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For everyone practicing evil hates the Light and does not come to the Light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But the one doing the truth comes to the Light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been worked in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He remained with them and immersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>And John also was immersing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were immersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John had not yet been thrown into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Then there arose a dispute between some of Johns disciples and the Jews about purification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore witness; behold, He is immersing, and everyone is coming to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, I have been sent to go before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegrooms voice. Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, but I must decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of the earth. He who comes from Heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>And what He has seen and heard, this He testifies; and no one receives His testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He who has received His testimony has set his seal that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For He whom God has sent speaks the Words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>The one believing into the Son has eternal life; but the one disobeying the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and immersed more disciples than John</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(though Jesus Himself did not immerse, but His disciples),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>He left Judea and departed again into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>And He needed to go through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Now Jacobs well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from His journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give Me a drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman? For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would give you living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman said to Him, Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will not ever thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I have no husband,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; in that you spoke truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers did homage on this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the right place to do homage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will do homage to the Father neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>You do homage to what you do not know; we do homage to what we know, for salvation is of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will do homage to the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father seeks such to do homage to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is Spirit, and those who do homage to Him must do homage in spirit and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming (who is called Christ). When He comes, He will make known all things to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus said to her, I AM! the One speaking to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He talked with a woman; yet no one said, What do You seek? or, Why are You talking with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>The woman then left her waterpot, went her way into the city, and said to the men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>Come, see a Man who told me everything that I ever did. Is this not the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>Then they went out of the city and came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>In the meantime His disciples urged Him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But He said to them, I have food to eat of which you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>Therefore the disciples said to one another, Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Do you not say, There are yet four months and then comes the harvest? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For in this the saying is true: One sows and another reaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed into Him because of the word of the woman who testified, He told me everything that I ever did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans had come to Him, they begged Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed through His Word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>And they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is truly the Christ, the Savior of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>Now after two days He departed from there and went into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>So when He came into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also had gone to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and begged Him to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Then Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The nobleman said to Him, Sir, come down before my child dies!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus said to him, Go your way; your son lives. So the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told him, saying, Your son lives!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>Then he inquired of them the hour when he got better. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. And he himself believed, and his whole household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This again is the second sign Jesus did when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>For an angel went down at certain times into the pool and stirred up the water; then whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>Now a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he already had been there a long time, He said to him, Do you want to be made well?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The sick man answered Him, Sir, I have no man to throw me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another goes down before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus said to him, Rise up, take up your bed and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And immediately the man was made well, took up his bed, and walked. And that day was the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>The Jews therefore said to him who was cured, It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered them, He who made me well said to me, Take up your bed and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>Then they asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your bed and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a multitude being in that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you have been made well. Sin no more, that a worse thing not come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son is not able to do anything from Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son also does likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself does; and He will show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raises the dead and gives life, even so the Son gives life to whom He wills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who has sent Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My Word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed from death unto life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>and has also given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and come forth; those who have done good, unto the resurrection of life, and those who have practiced evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I am able to do nothing from Myself. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I bear witness concerning Myself, My testimony is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is another who bears witness concerning Me, and I know that the testimony which He witnesses concerning Me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>Yet I do not receive testimony from man, but I say these things that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have a greater testimony than Johns; for the works which the Father has given Me to finish, the very works that I do, bear witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father Himself, who sent Me, has testified of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>And you do not have His Word abiding in you, because whom He sent, Him you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I do not receive honor from men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come in My Fathers name, and you do not receive Me. If another comes in his own name, him you will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can you believe, who receive honor from one another, and do not seek the honor that comes from God only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; there is one who accuses you; Moses, in whom you have hoped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After these things Jesus went away over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>And a great multitude followed Him, because they saw His signs which He performed on those who were diseased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>And Jesus went up to the mountain, and there He sat with His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>Now the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Then Jesus lifted up His eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward Him, He said to Philip, Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He was about to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered Him, Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may receive even a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peters brother, said to Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish; but what are they among so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>And Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks He distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those sitting down; and likewise of the fish, as much as they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>So when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, so that nothing is lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>Therefore they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Therefore when Jesus perceived that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king, He withdrew again to the mountain by Himself alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>And when evening had come, His disciples went down to the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>got into the boat, and went across the sea toward Capernaum. And it was already dark, and Jesus had not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>And the sea arose because a great wind was blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But He said to them, It is I. Do not be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they willingly received Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>On the following day, when the people who were standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with His disciples, but His disciples had gone away alone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>however, other boats came from Tiberias, near the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they also got into boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did You come here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>Then they said to Him, What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom He sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>Therefore they said to Him, What sign do You show then, that we may see and believe You? What do You work?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread from Heaven to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread out of Heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For the bread of God is He who comes down from Heaven and gives life to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>Then they said to Him, Lord, give us this bread always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>And Jesus said to them, I am the Bread of Life. He who comes to Me shall not ever hunger, and he who believes into Me shall never ever thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But I said to you that you also have seen Me and do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I have come down out of Heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>This is the will of the Father who sent Me, that of all He has given Me I should not lose any of it, but should raise it up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes into Him may have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>The Jews then murmured about Him, because He said, I am the Bread coming down out of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that He says, I have come down out of Heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Do not murmur among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It is written in the Prophets, And they shall all be taught by God. Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He who is from God; He has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes into Me has eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the Bread of Life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>This is the Bread which comes down out of Heaven, that one may eat of it and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the Living Bread which came down out of Heaven. If anyone eats of this Bread, he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>The Jews therefore argued among themselves, saying, How can this Man give us His flesh to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>For My flesh is truly food, and My blood is truly drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>As the living Father sent Me, and I live through the Father, so he who feeds on Me will live through Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This is the Bread which came down out of Heaven; not as your fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard this, said, This is a hard saying; who is able to hear it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples murmured about this, He said to them, Does this offend you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>What then if you should see the Son of Man ascend where He was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh does not profit; not a thing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who were not believing, and who would betray Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>And He said, Therefore I have said to you that no one is able to come to Me unless it has been granted to him from My Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Then Jesus said to the twelve, Do you also want to go away?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the Words of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>And we have believed and understood that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you, the twelve, but one of you is a devil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, for it was he who was about to betray Him, being one of the twelve.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for He did not want to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now the Jewish Feast of Booths was at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>His brothers therefore said to Him, Depart from here and go into Judea, that Your disciples also may see the works that You do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For no one does anything in secret while he himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these things, make Yourself known to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>For neither did His brothers believe into Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Then Jesus said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The world cannot hate you; but it hates Me because I bear witness of it that its works are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.8'>You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to the feast, for My time has not yet been fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>When He had said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>But when His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>Then the Jews sought Him at the feast, and said, Where is He?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning Him. Some said, He is good; others said, No, rather, He leads the multitudes astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>However, no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>And the Jews marveled, saying, How does this Man know letters, having never studied?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If anyone wants to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak out of Myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Did not Moses give you the Law, yet none of you keeps the Law? Why do you seek to kill Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>The people answered and said, You have a demon. Who seeks to kill You?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and you all marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'>If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, so that the Law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'>Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Then some of them from Jerusalem said, Is this not He whom they seek to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>But behold, He speaks boldly, and they say nothing to Him. Perhaps the rulers truly know that this is truly the Christ?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>Then Jesus cried out, as He taught in the temple, saying, You both know Me, and you know where I am from; and I have not come from Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>Therefore they sought to take Him; but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>And many out of the crowd believed into Him, and said, When the Christ comes, will He do more signs than these which this Man has done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Then Jesus said to them, I shall be with you a little while longer, and then I go to Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>You will seek Me and not find Me, and where I am you are not able to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>Then the Jews said among themselves, Where does He intend to go that we shall not find Him? He does not intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, does He?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What is this thing that He said, You will seek Me and not find Me, and where I am you are not able to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing into Him were about to receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>Therefore many from the crowd, when they heard this saying, said, Truly this is the Prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Christ does not come out of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'>Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>So there was a division in the crowd because of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>And some of them wanted to take Him, but no one laid hands on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, Why have you not brought Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The officers answered, No man ever spoke like this Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'>Then the Pharisees answered them, Have you not also been led astray?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'>Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed into Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'>But this crowd that does not know the Law is accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'>Nicodemus (he who came to Jesus by night, being one of them) said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.51'>Does our Law judge a man before it hears him and knows what he does?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.52'>They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search and look, for no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.53'>And each one went to his own house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.8'>
        <verse osisID='John.8.1'>But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.2'>And early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him; and He sat down and taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>And the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>they said to Him, Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'>Now Moses, in the Law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>This they said, testing Him, that they might have something of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as though He did not hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.8'>And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>Then those who heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>She said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'>Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, I am the Light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the Light of Life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.13'>The Pharisees therefore said to Him, You bear witness of Yourself; Your testimony is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.14'>Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness of Myself, My testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from and where I am going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'>You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.16'>And yet if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.17'>It is also written in your Law that the testimony of two men is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.18'>I am One who bears witness of Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness of Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>Then they said to Him, Where is Your Father? Jesus answered, You know neither Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'>These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no one laid hands on Him, for His hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>Then Jesus said to them again, I am going away, and you will seek Me, and will die in your sin. Where I go you are not able to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.22'>So the Jews said, Will He kill Himself, because He says, Where I go you are not able to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.23'>And He said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above. You are from this world; I am not from this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.24'>Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I AM, you will die in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>Then they said to Him, Who are You? And Jesus said to them, The Beginning; what I have been saying to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I heard from Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>They did not understand that He spoke to them of the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>Then Jesus said to them, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I AM, and that I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.29'>And He who sent Me is with Me. The Father has not left Me alone, for I always do those things that please Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>As He spoke these words, many believed into Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'>Then Jesus said to those Jews who had believed in Him, If you continue to abide in My Word, you are truly My disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.32'>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>They answered Him, We are Abrahams seed, and have been in slavery to no one at any time. How can You say, You will be made free?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.34'>Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Everyone practicing sin is a slave of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.35'>And a slave does not remain in the house forever, but the son remains forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.36'>Therefore if the Son sets you free, you shall truly be free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'>I know that you are Abrahams seed, but you seek to kill Me, because My Word has no place in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.38'>I speak what I have seen with My Father, and you do what you have seen with your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>They answered and said to Him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abrahams children, you would do the works of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'>But now you seek to kill Me, a Man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>You do the works of your father. Then they said to Him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father; God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come from Myself, but He sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to hear My Word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>You are of the devil as your father, and the lusts of your father you purpose to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own, for he is a liar and the father of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>And because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'>Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'>He who is of God hears Gods Words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'>Then the Jews answered and said to Him, Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>Jesus answered, I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'>And I do not seek My own glory; there is One who seeks and judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>Truly, truly, I say to you, If anyone keeps My Word he shall certainly never ever see death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.52'>Then the Jews said to Him, Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and You say, If anyone keeps My Word he shall never ever taste death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died. Whom do You make Yourself out to be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My honor is nothing. It is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I say, I do not know Him, I shall be a liar like you; but I do know Him and keep His Word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'>Then the Jews said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.58'>Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came to be, I AM.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.59'>Then they took up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus was hidden and went forth out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.9'>
        <verse osisID='John.9.1'>And as Jesus passed by, He saw a man who was blind from birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.2'>And His disciples asked Him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.3'>Jesus answered, Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God should be revealed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.4'>It is necessary for Me to work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; the night is coming when no one is able to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.5'>As long as I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.6'>When He had said these things, He spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva; and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.7'>And He said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is translated, Sent). So he went and washed, and came back seeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.8'>Therefore the neighbors and those who previously had seen that he was blind said, Is not this he who sat and begged?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.9'>Some said, This is he. Others said, He is like him. He said, I am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.10'>Therefore they said to him, How were your eyes opened?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.11'>He answered and said, A Man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and I received sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.12'>Then they said to him, Where is He? He said, I do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.13'>They brought him who formerly was blind to the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.14'>And it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.15'>Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.16'>Therefore some of the Pharisees said, This Man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath. Others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.17'>They said to the blind man again, What do you say about Him because He opened your eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.18'>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.19'>And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.20'>His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.21'>but by what means he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. He is of age; ask him. He will speak for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.22'>His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already that if anyone should confess that He was Christ, he would be expelled from the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.23'>Therefore his parents said, He is of age; ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.24'>So they again called the man who was blind, and said to him, Give God the glory. We know that this Man is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.25'>He answered and said, Whether He is a sinner or not I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.26'>Then they said to him again, What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.27'>He answered them, I told you already, and you did not hear. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you not also want to become His disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.28'>Then they reviled him and said, You are His disciple, but we are Moses disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.29'>We know that God spoke to Moses; as for this fellow, we do not know where He is from.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.30'>The man answered and said to them, Why, this is a marvelous thing, that you do not know where He is from; yet He has opened my eyes!</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.33'>If this Man were not from God, He would not be able to do anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.34'>They answered and said to him, You were born completely in sins, and do you teach us? And they drove him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.35'>Jesus heard that they had driven him out; and when He had found him, He said to him, Do you believe into the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.36'>He answered and said, Who is He, Lord, that I may believe into Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.37'>And Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him and it is He who is talking with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.38'>And he said, Lord, I believe! And he did homage to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.39'>And Jesus said, For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.40'>Then some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words, and said to Him, Are we blind also?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.39'>Therefore they sought again to seize Him, but He escaped out of their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was immersing at first, and there He stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>Then many came to Him and said, John performed no sign, but all the things that John spoke about this Man were true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.42'>And many believed into Him there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>Therefore the sisters sent to Him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>When Jesus heard that, He said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>So, when He heard that he was sick, He stayed two more days in the place where He was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after this He said to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, lately the Jews sought to stone You, and do You go there again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the Light is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>These things He said, and after that He said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>Then His disciples said, Lord, if he sleeps he will get well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>However, Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then Jesus said to them plainly, Lazarus has died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, that you may believe. Nevertheless let us go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>And many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met Him, but Mary was sitting in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha said to Him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, I am the Resurrection and the Life. He who believes into Me, though he may die, he shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>And everyone living and believing into Me shall never ever die. Do you believe this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She said to Him, Yes, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who comes into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And when she had said these things, she went her way and secretly called Mary her sister, saying, The Teacher is here and calls for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>And He said, Where have you laid him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>Then the Jews said, See how He loved him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>And some of them said, Would not this Man, who opened the eyes of the blind, also have been able to keep this man from dying?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to Him, Lord, by this time there is a stench, for it is four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus said to her, Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>Then they took away the stone from where the dead man was lying. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>And I know that You always hear Me, but because of the crowd standing by I said this, that they may believe that You sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And when He had said these things, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus! Out here! Now!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>And he who had died came out bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, Loose him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen the things Jesus did, believed into Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, What shall we do? For this Man performs many signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let Him alone like this, everyone will believe into Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>And one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, You know nothing at all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>Now this he did not say from himself; but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for that nation only, but also that He would gather together into one the children of God who had been scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>Then, from that day on, they took counsel to kill Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and stayed there with His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>And the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>Then they sought Jesus, and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple, What do you think; that He will not come to the feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if anyone knew where He was, he should report it, that they might seize Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had died, whom He raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>There they made Him a supper; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those reclining with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Then Mary took a pound of very costly ointment of spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Then one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simons son, who was about to betray Him, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the moneybag; and he used to take what was put in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>But Jesus said, Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of My burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For the poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>Now a great many of the Jews knew that He was there; and they came, not because of Jesus only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the chief priests took counsel to put Lazarus to death also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because on account of him many of the Jews went away and continued to believe into Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>The next day a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him, and cried out: Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! The King of Israel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jesus, when He had found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King is coming, sitting on a donkeys colt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him and that they had done these things to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>Therefore the crowd, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead, bore witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>For this reason also the crowd met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Behold, the world has gone after Him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now there were certain Greeks among those who came up to do homage at the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>But Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it unto eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also. If anyone serves Me, My Father will honor him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save Me out of this hour? But for this purpose I came unto this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify Your name. Then a voice came from Heaven, saying, I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>Therefore the people who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, An angel has spoken to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered and said, This voice did not come because of Me, but because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all to Myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>This He said, signifying by what sort of death He was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The people answered Him, We have heard out of the Law that the Christ remains forever; and how can You say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Then Jesus said to them, A little while longer the Light is with you. Walk while you have the Light, that darkness not overtake you; for he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While you have the Light, believe into the Light, that you may become sons of Light. These things Jesus spoke, and departed, and was hidden from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But although He had done so many signs before them, they did not believe into Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Therefore they were not able to believe, because Isaiah said again:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, that they should not see with their eyes, that they should not understand with their hearts and be turned, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed into Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, that they might not be put out of the synagogue;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>And Jesus cried out and said, He who believes into Me, believes not into Me but into Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I have come as a Light into the world, that everyone believing into Me should not remain in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And if anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He who rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him; the Word that I speak will judge him in the Last Day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who sent Me gives Me orders, what I should say and what I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that His command is eternal life. Therefore, whatever I speak, just as the Father has said unto Me, so I speak.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour had come that He should depart from this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>And supper being ended, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simons son, to betray Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He was come from God and was going to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>Then He comes to Simon Peter. And Peter says to Him, Lord, do You wash my feet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.7'>Jesus answered and said to him, What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will come to understand after this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.8'>Peter said to Him, You shall certainly not ever wash my feet! Jesus answered him, If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.9'>Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus said to him, He who is bathed has no other need than to wash his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>For He knew who was betraying Him; therefore He said, Not everyone of you is clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>So when He had washed their feet, taken His garments, and reclined again, He said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.13'>You call me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.14'>If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one anothers feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.15'>For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.16'>Truly, truly, I say to you, A servant is not greater than his master; nor is the messenger greater than the one sending him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.17'>If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.18'>I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.19'>Now I tell you before it happens, that when it does come to pass, you may believe that I AM.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.20'>Truly, truly, I say to you, He who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.21'>When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you will betray Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.22'>Then the disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom He spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.23'>Now there was reclining at Jesus bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.24'>Simon Peter therefore nodded to him to ask who it might be of whom He spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.25'>Then, leaning back on Jesus breast, he said to Him, Lord, who is it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.26'>Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give a morsel when I have dipped it. And having dipped the morsel, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.27'>And after the morsel, Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.28'>But no one at the table knew for what reason He said this to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.29'>For some thought, because Judas had the moneybag, that Jesus was saying to him, Buy those things we need for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.30'>Having received the morsel, he then went out immediately. And it was night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.31'>So, when he had gone out, Jesus said, Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.32'>If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and glorify Him at once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.33'>Little children, I shall be with you a little while longer. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, Where I am going, you are not able to come, so now I say to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.34'>A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I love you, that you also love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.35'>By this everyone will know that you are My disciples, if you have love mutually with one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.36'>Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, where are You going? Jesus answered him, Where I am going you are not able to follow Me now, but you shall follow Me afterward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.37'>Peter said to Him, Lord, why am I not able to follow You now? I will lay down my life for You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.38'>Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster shall not crow till you will deny Me three times.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.1'>When Jesus had spoken these words, He went out with His disciples over the Brook Kidron, where there was a garden, which He and His disciples entered.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.3'>Then Judas, having received a company of troops, and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.4'>Jesus therefore, knowing all things coming upon Him, went forth and said to them, Whom do you seek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.5'>They answered Him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I AM! And Judas, who betrayed Him, also stood with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.6'>Now when He said to them, I AM, they fell backwards and were thrown to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.7'>Then He asked them again, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.10'>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priests servant, and cut off his right ear. The servants name was Malchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.11'>So Jesus said to Peter, Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.16'>But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought Peter in.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.19'>The high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.20'>Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where the Jews always meet, and in secret I have said nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.21'>Why do you question Me? Ask those who have heard Me what I said to them. Behold, they know what I said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.22'>And when He had said these things, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Do You answer the high priest this way?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.25'>Now Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. Therefore they said to him, Are you not also one of His disciples? He denied it and said, I am not.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They answered and said to him, If He were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him up to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>Then Pilate said to them, You take Him and judge Him according to your Law. Therefore the Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke, signifying by what death He would die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again, called Jesus, and said to Him, Are You the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus answered him, Do you say this from yourself, or did others tell you this concerning Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now My kingdom is not from here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate therefore said to Him, Are You a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the Truth. Everyone who is of the Truth hears My voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate said to Him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, I find no fault in Him at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But you have a custom that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Do you therefore want me to release to you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>Then they all cried again, saying, Not this Man, but Barabbas! Now Barabbas was a robber.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Pilate then went out again, and said to them, Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, Behold the Man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>Therefore, when the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify Him, crucify Him! Pilate said to them, You take Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>Therefore, when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more terrified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and went again into the Praetorium, and said to Jesus, Where are You from? But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Then Pilate said to Him, Do You not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to crucify You, and authority to release You?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered, You could have no authority at all against Me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>From then on Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this Man go, you are not Caesars friend. Everyone making himself a king speaks against Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, Behold your King!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, Away with Him, away with Him! Crucify Him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led Him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And He, bearing His cross, went out to a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews, but, He said, I am the King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>They said therefore among themselves, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots. Therefore the soldiers did these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mothers sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, Woman, behold your son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then He said to the disciple, Behold your mother. And from that hour that disciple took her into his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>Now a vessel full of vinegar was sitting there; and they filled a sponge with vinegar, put it on hyssop, and put it to His mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>So when Jesus had received the vinegar, He said, It has been finished! And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>Therefore, because it was the Preparation Day, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he who has seen has borne witness, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he speaks the truth, so that you may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, Not one of His bones shall be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another Scripture says, They shall look on Him whom they pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. And he came and took the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in strips of linen with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>So there they laid Jesus, because of the Jews Preparation Day, for the tomb was nearby.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter therefore went out, and the other disciple, and came to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>So they both ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>And he, stooping down and looking in, saw the linen cloths lying there; yet he did not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; and he saw the linen cloths lying there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the face cloth that had been around His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple, who came to the tomb first, went in also; and he saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that it was necessary for Him to rise again from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood outside near the tomb weeping, and as she wept she stooped down into the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>And she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>And when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him, Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said to her, Mary! She turned and said to Him, Rabboni! (which is to say, Teacher)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus said to her, Do not cling to Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>Then, the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>So Jesus said to them again, Peace to you. As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; whatever you lay hold upon, it is held fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>But Thomas, called the Twin, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. So he said to them, Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not ever believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then He said to Thomas, Bring your finger here, and look at My hands; and bring your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>And Thomas answered and said to Him, My Lord and my God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those not seeing and yet believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>And truly Jesus did many other signs before His disciples, which are not written in this book;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After these things Jesus showed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and in this way He showed Himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said to him, We are coming with you also. They went out and immediately got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Then Jesus said to them, Children, you do not have any fish, do you? They answered Him, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some. So they cast, and now they were not able to draw it in because of the multitude of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he was naked), and plunged into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits), dragging the net with fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>Then, as soon as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish which you have caught now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went up and dragged the net to land, full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus said to them, Come and eat breakfast. Yet none of the disciples dared ask Him, Who are You? knowing that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This is now the third time Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord; You know that I am deeply fond of You. He said to him, Feed My lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He said to him again a second time, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me? He said to Him, Yes, Lord; You know that I am deeply fond of You. He said to him, Tend My sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He said to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonah, are you deeply fond of Me? Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, Are you deeply fond of Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You discern all things; You know that I am deeply fond of You. Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>This He spoke, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, Follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also had leaned on His breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is the one who betrays You?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, But Lord, what about this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus said to him, If I intend for him to remain till I come, what is that to you? You follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>Then this saying went out among the brethren that this disciple does not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he does not die, but, If I intend for him to remain till I come, what is that to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these things, and writes these things; and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.</verse>
