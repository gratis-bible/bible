  <div osisID='2Sam' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.1'>Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David remained two days in Ziklag,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.2'>that on the third day, behold, a man came from Sauls camp with his clothes torn and earth on his head. So it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.3'>And David said to him, Where have you come from? So he said to him, I have escaped from the camp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.4'>And David said to him, How did the matter go? Please tell me. And he answered, The people have fled from the battle, many of the people have fallen and died, and Saul and Jonathan his son have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.5'>And David said to the young man who told him, How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son have died?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.6'>And the young man who told him said, As I happened by chance to be on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and horsemen closely pursued him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.7'>And when he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I answered, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.8'>And he said to me, Who are you? So I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.9'>He said to me again, Please stand over me and kill me, for agony has seized me because my soul still remains in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.10'>So I stood over him and killed him, because I perceived that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.11'>Then David took hold of his own clothes and tore them, and so did all the men with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.12'>And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son, for the people of Jehovah and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.13'>Then David said to the young man who told him, Where are you from? And he answered, I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.14'>And David said to him, How was it you were not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the anointed of Jehovah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.15'>And David summoned one of the young men and said, Go near, and fall upon him! And he struck him so that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.16'>And David said to him, Your blood is on your own head, for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have killed the anointed of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.17'>Then David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.18'>and he commanded them to teach the sons of Judah the Song of the Bow; behold, it is written in the Book of Jasher:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.19'>The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.20'>Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.21'>O mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, nor fields of offerings; for the shield of the mighty has been rejected as loathsome there! The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.22'>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan has not turned back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.23'>Saul and Jonathan were beloved and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they have not been separated. They have been swifter than eagles, they have been stronger than lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.24'>O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with luxury; who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.25'>How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan, slain on your high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.26'>I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan. You have been very pleasant to me; your love to me was wonderful, surpassing the love of women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.27'>How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.1'>It happened after this that David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up to any of the cities of Judah? And Jehovah said to him, Go up. David said, Where shall I go up? And He said, To Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.2'>So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widowed wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.3'>And David brought up the men who were with him, every man with his household. So they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.4'>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they reported to David, saying, The men of Jabesh Gilead were the ones who buried Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.5'>So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, You are blessed of Jehovah, for you have shown this kindness to your lord, to Saul, and have buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.6'>And now may Jehovah show kindness and truth to you. I also will deal kindly with you, because you have done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.7'>Now therefore, let your hands be strengthened, and be valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me as king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.8'>But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Sauls army, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.9'>and he made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.10'>Ishbosheth, Sauls son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. Only the house of Judah followed David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.11'>And the number of days that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.12'>And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.13'>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. So they sat down, one on one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.14'>And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise and make sport before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.15'>So they arose and went over by number, twelve from Benjamin for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.16'>And each one grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponents side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called the Field of Swords, which is in Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.17'>And the battle was fierce that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were smitten before the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.18'>Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab and Abishai and Asahel. And Asahel was as fleet of foot as a gazelle in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.19'>And Asahel pursued after Abner, and in going he did not turn to the right hand or to the left from after Abner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.20'>Then Abner looked behind him and said, Are you Asahel? He answered, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.21'>And Abner said to him, Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay hold on one of the young men and take his spoils for yourself. But Asahel would not turn aside from after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.22'>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn aside from after me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then shall I lift up my face to your brother Joab?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.23'>However, he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the back end of the spear, so that the spear came out his back; and he fell down there and died on the spot. So it was that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.24'>Joab and Abishai also pursued after Abner. And the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is before Giah by the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.25'>And the sons of Benjamin gathered together after Abner and became one band, and took their stand on top of a hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.26'>Then Abner called to Joab and said, Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the end? How long will it be then until you tell the people to turn back from after their brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.27'>And Joab said, As God lives, unless you had spoken, surely then by morning the people would have gone up, every one after his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.28'>So Joab blew a shofar; and all the people stood still and did not pursue after Israel anymore, nor did they fight anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.29'>And Abner and his men went on all that night through the plain, crossed over the Jordan, and went through Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.30'>And Joab returned from pursuing after Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing of Davids servants nineteen men and Asahel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.31'>But the servants of David had struck down, of Benjamin and Abners men, three hundred and sixty men who died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.32'>And they took up Asahel and buried him in his fathers tomb, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at daybreak.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.1'>Now there was long warfare between the house of Saul and the house of David. But David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.2'>And sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.3'>his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widowed wife of Nabal the Carmelite; the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.4'>the fourth, Adonijah, the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah, the son of Abital;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.5'>and the sixth, Ithream, by Davids wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.6'>Now it was so, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.7'>And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ishbosheth said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my fathers concubine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.8'>Then Abner became very angry at the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dogs head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.9'>May God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David as Jehovah has sworn to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.10'>to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beer-sheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.11'>And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.12'>And Abner sent messengers on his behalf to David, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring around all Israel to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.13'>And David said, Good, I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I am asking of you: you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Sauls daughter, when you come to see my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.14'>And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Sauls son, saying, Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.15'>And Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.16'>And her husband went along with her to Bahurim, weeping behind her. And Abner said to him, Go, return. And he returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.17'>And the words of Abner had come to the elders of Israel, saying, In time past you were desiring David as king over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.18'>Now then, do it! For Jehovah has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of My servant David, I will save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.19'>And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin. And Abner also went to speak in the ears of David at Hebron all that was good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of the house of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.20'>So Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.21'>And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires. And David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.22'>And behold the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoils with them. And Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.23'>And when Joab and all the troops that were with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner has come to the king, and he sent him away, and he has gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.24'>Then Joab came to the king and said, What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why is it that you sent him away, and he has left to go?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.25'>You realize that Abner the son of Ner has come to deceive you, to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.26'>And when Joab had left David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.27'>And when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him privately, and there stabbed him in the stomach, so that he died for the blood of Asahel his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.28'>And afterward, when David heard it, he said, My kingdom and I are guiltless before Jehovah forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.29'>May it whirl about on the head of Joab and on all his fathers house; and let there never fail to be in the house of Joab one who has a discharge or is a leper, who leans on a staff or falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.30'>So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.31'>And David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, Tear your clothes, gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn for Abner. And King David walked behind the coffin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.32'>And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.33'>And the king lamented over Abner and said: Should Abner die the death of a fool?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.34'>Your hands were not bound nor your feet put into fetters; as a man falls before wicked men, so you have fallen. Then all the people wept over him again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.35'>And when all the people came to give David food to eat while it was still day, David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.36'>And all the people took note of it, and it was good in their eyes, even as whatever the king had done was good in the eyes of all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.37'>For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been from the king, to kill Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.38'>And the king said to his servants, Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.39'>And I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too severe for me. Jehovah shall repay the evildoer according to his evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.1'>When Sauls son heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his hands fell limp, and all Israel was dismayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.2'>Now Sauls son had two men who were commanders of troops. The name of one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin. (For Beeroth also was part of Benjamin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.3'>because the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and are sojourning there to this day.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.4'>And Jonathan, Sauls son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel; and his nurse took him up and fled. And it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.5'>And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out and came at the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who was lying on his bed at noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.6'>And when they had come there, into the middle of the house, as though carrying wheat, they stabbed him in the stomach. And Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.7'>Now when they came into the house, he was lying on his bed in his bedroom; then they struck him and killed him, beheaded him and took his head, and were all night escaping through the plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.8'>And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul your enemy, who had sought your life. Jehovah has requited vengeance for my lord the king this day upon Saul and his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.9'>But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As Jehovah lives, who has redeemed my soul from all distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.10'>when someone told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good news, I took him and killed him in Ziklag; the reward I gave him for his news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.11'>How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed? Therefore, shall I not now require his blood at your hand and remove you from the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.12'>And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, cut off their hands and feet, and hung them by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner at Hebron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.1'>Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.2'>Also, in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were the one leading Israel out and bringing them in; and Jehovah said to you, You shall shepherd My people Israel, and be ruler over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.3'>So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before Jehovah. And they anointed David king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.4'>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.5'>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.6'>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem, to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, You shall not come in here; but the blind and the lame will repel you, thinking, David cannot come in here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.7'>Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. It is the City of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.8'>And David said on that day, Whoever climbs up by way of the water conduit let him strike down the Jebusites, the lame and the blind, who are hated by Davids soul. Therefore they say, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.9'>So David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the City of David. And David built all around from the fortifications and inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.10'>And David went on and became great, and Jehovah the God of Hosts was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.11'>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and craftsmen and masons. And they built David a house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.12'>Thus David recognized that Jehovah had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted His kingdom for His people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.13'>And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron. Also more sons and daughters were born to David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.14'>And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.15'>Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.16'>Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.17'>Now when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. And David heard of it and went down to the stronghold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.18'>The Philistines also went and spread themselves out in the Valley of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.19'>And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said to David, Go up, for I will deliver up to give the Philistines into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.20'>So David went to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and he said, Jehovah has broken through my enemies before me, like water bursting forth. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.21'>And they abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.22'>Then the Philistines went up again and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.23'>And David inquired of Jehovah, and He said, You shall not go up; circle around behind them, and come upon them in front of the balsam trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.24'>And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, that you shall be decisive. For then Jehovah shall have gone out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.25'>And David did so, as Jehovah had commanded him; and he struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.1'>Again David gathered all the choice men of Israel, thirty thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.2'>And David rose up and went, and all the people who were with him from Baale Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of Jehovah of Hosts, who dwells between the cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.3'>And they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the new cart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.4'>They brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill, with the ark of God; and Ahio was going before the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.5'>And David and all the house of Israel were making sport before Jehovah with all manner of fir wood; with harps, with lutes, with tambourines, with rattles and buzzing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.6'>And when they came to Nachons threshing floor, Uzzah stretched out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen had fallen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.7'>And the anger of Jehovah burned against Uzzah, and God struck him there for his error; and he died there by the ark of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.8'>And David was furious because Jehovah had used violence and burst forth against Uzzah; thus the name of the place is called Perez Uzzah to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.9'>And David was afraid of Jehovah that day; and he said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.10'>So David was not willing to remove the ark of Jehovah to himself into the City of David; but David turned it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.11'>And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months. And Jehovah blessed Obed-Edom and all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.12'>And it was reported to King David, saying, Jehovah has blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.13'>And so it was, when those bearing the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, that he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.14'>And David was dancing before Jehovah with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.15'>So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of Jehovah with shouting and with the sound of the shofar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.16'>And as the ark of Jehovah was coming into the City of David, Michal, Sauls daughter, looked through a window and saw King David leaping and whirling before Jehovah; and she despised him in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.17'>And they brought the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place in the midst of the tent that David had erected for it. And David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.18'>And when David finished offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.19'>And he distributed among all the people, among the whole multitude of Israel, both the women and the men, to everyone a cake of bread, a piece of meat, and a cake of raisins. And all the people departed, everyone to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.20'>Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, uncovering himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the worthless fellows uncovers to reveal himself!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.21'>And David said to Michal, It was before Jehovah, who chose me instead of your father and all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of Jehovah, over Israel. Therefore I have danced before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.22'>And I have been even more lightly esteemed than this, and humble in my own eyes. But as for the handmaids of whom you have spoken, by them I was honored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.23'>Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.13'>And when David summoned him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. And at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.14'>In the morning it happened that David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.15'>And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriah in the forefront of the strongest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck down and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.16'>So it was, while Joab besieged the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew there were valiant men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.17'>And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab. And some of the people of the servants of David fell; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.18'>And Joab sent and reported to David all the things concerning the war,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.19'>and charged the messenger, saying, When you have finished speaking of the matters of the war to the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.20'>if it happens that the kings wrath arises, and he says to you: Why did you approach so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.21'>Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast a piece of millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you go near the wall? then you shall say, Your servant Uriah the Hittite has died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.22'>So the messenger went, and came and reported to David all that Joab had sent by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.23'>And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us and came out to us in the field; then we were upon them as far as the entrance of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.24'>And the archers shot from the wall at your servants; and some of the kings servants died, and your servant Uriah the Hittite has also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.25'>And David said to the messenger, Thus you shall say to Joab: Do not let this thing cause your eye to quiver, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen the battle against the city, and overthrow it. And encourage him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.26'>When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband had died, she mourned for her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.27'>And when her mourning was passed, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done caused the eyes of Jehovah to quiver.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.1'>And Jehovah sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him: There were two men in one city, one rich and the other poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.2'>The rich man had exceedingly many flocks and herds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.3'>But the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished; and it grew up together with him and with his children. It ate of his own food and drank from his own cup and lay in his bosom; and it was like a daughter to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.4'>And a traveler came to the rich man, who spared to take from his own flock and from his own herd to prepare one for the wayfaring man who had come to him; but he took the poor mans lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.5'>And Davids anger burned greatly against the man, and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah lives, the man who has done this is a son of death!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.6'>And he shall restore fourfold for the lamb, because he has done this thing and because he had no pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.7'>And Nathan said to David, You are the man! Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.8'>I gave you your masters house and your masters wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if that had been too little, I also would have given you this and that!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.9'>Why have you despised the Word of Jehovah, to do evil in His eyes? You have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword; you have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.10'>Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.11'>Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up evil against you from your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the eyes of the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.12'>For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, before the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.13'>And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said to David, Jehovah also has put away your sin; you shall not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.14'>However, because of this matter in which you have caused contempt, for Jehovah to be spurned by His enemies, the child also who is born to you shall die the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.15'>And Nathan departed to his house. And Jehovah struck the child that Uriahs wife had borne to David, and it became sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.16'>David therefore besought God for the child, and David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.17'>And the elders of his house arose and went to him, to raise him up from the ground. But he would not, nor did he eat food with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.18'>And on the seventh day it came to pass that the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child had died. For they said, Behold, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not heed our voice. How can we tell him that the child has died? He may do some harm!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.19'>But when David saw that his servants were whispering, David perceived that the child had died. Therefore David said to his servants, Has the child died? And they said, He has died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.20'>So David rose up from the ground, washed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of Jehovah and prostrated himself. Then he went to his own house; and when he requested, they set food before him, and he ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.21'>Then his servants said to him, What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child had died, you arose and ate food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.22'>And he said, While the child was alive, I fasted and wept; for I thought, Who knows whether Jehovah will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.23'>But now he has died; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.24'>And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her and lay with her. And she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. Now Jehovah loved him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.25'>and He sent word by the hand of Nathan the prophet: So he called his name Jedidiah, because of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.26'>Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and captured the royal city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.27'>And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and I have captured the city of waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.28'>Now therefore, gather the rest of the people together and lay siege against the city and take it, lest I capture the city and it be called after my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.29'>So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, fought against it, and captured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.30'>And he took their kings crown from his head. Its weight was a talent of gold, with precious stones. And it was set on Davids head. Also he brought out the spoils of the city in great abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.31'>And he brought out the people who were in it, and put them under saws, iron picks and iron axes, and made them cross over into the brick kiln. Thus he did to all the cities of the people of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.1'>After this Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.2'>Amnon was so distressed over his sister Tamar that he became sick; for she was a virgin; and it was difficult in Amnons eyes to do anything to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.3'>But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah, Davids brother. Now Jonadab was a very shrewd man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.4'>And he said to him, Why are you, the kings son, so low morning after morning? Will you not tell me? Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absaloms sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.5'>So Jonadab said to him, Lie down on your bed and make yourself sick. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, Please let my sister Tamar come and give me food, and prepare the food before my eyes, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.6'>So Amnon lay down and made himself sick; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let Tamar my sister come and make a couple of cakes for me before my eyes, that I may eat from her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.7'>And David sent to the house for Tamar, saying, Now go to your brother Amnons house, and prepare food for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.8'>So Tamar went to her brother Amnons house; and he was lying down. Then she took flour and kneaded it, made cakes before his eyes, and baked the cakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.9'>And she took the pan and poured them out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have everyone go out from me. And they all went out from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.10'>And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the inner room, that I may eat from your hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them to Amnon her brother in the inner room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.11'>And when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.12'>And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me, for no such thing should be done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.13'>And I, where could I take my shame? And as for you, you would be like one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.14'>However, he would not heed her voice; and being stronger than she, he forced her and lay with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.15'>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise and go!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.16'>And she said to him, For what reason? This evil to send me away is worse than the other that you have done to me. But he would not listen to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.17'>Then he summoned his servant who attended him, and said, Send this woman out away from me, and bolt the door behind her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.18'>And she had on a tunic of many colors, for the kings virgin daughters wore such robes. And his servant brought her outside and bolted the door behind her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.19'>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her tunic of many colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head and went away, crying out as she went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.20'>And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now keep silent, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absaloms house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.21'>But when King David heard of all these things, he was extremely furious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.22'>And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad. For Absalom hated Amnon, because he had humbled his sister Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.23'>And it came to pass, after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is near Ephraim; and Absalom invited all the kings sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.24'>And Absalom came to the king and said, Behold, your servant has sheepshearers; please, let the king and his servants go with your servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.25'>But the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go now, lest we be a burden to you. And he pressed him, but he would not go, but blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.26'>Then Absalom said, If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.27'>But Absalom pressed him; so he let Amnon and all the kings sons go with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.28'>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Watch now, when Amnons heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Strike Amnon! then kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and valiant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.29'>And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. And all the kings sons arose, and each one got on his mule and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.30'>And it came to pass, while they were on the way, that news came to David, saying, Absalom has killed all the kings sons, and not one of them is left!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.31'>So the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the ground, and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.32'>Then Jonadab the son of Shimeah, Davids brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose they have killed all the young men, the kings sons, for only Amnon has died. For at the mouth of Absalom this has been determined since the day that he humbled his sister Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.33'>Now therefore, let not my lord the king take this word to heart, to think that all the kings sons have died; for only Amnon has died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.34'>Then Absalom fled. And the young man who was keeping watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the way along the hillside behind him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.35'>And Jonadab said to the king, Look! The kings sons have come; according to your servants word, so it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.36'>So it was, as soon as he had finished speaking, that behold the kings sons came, and they lifted up their voice and wept. Also the king and all his servants wept with a very great weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.37'>But Absalom had fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.38'>So Absalom had fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.39'>And King David longed to go to Absalom. For he had been comforted concerning Amnon, because he had died.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.14'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.1'>Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the kings heart was toward Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.2'>And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman, and said to her, Please pretend to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel; do not anoint yourself with oil, but act like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.3'>Go to the king and speak to him in this manner. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.4'>And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself, and said, Help, O king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.5'>And the king said to her, What is troubling you? And she answered, Truly I am a widow and my husband is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.6'>And your handmaid had two sons; and the two fought with each other in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one struck the other and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.7'>And now the whole family has risen up against your handmaid, and said, Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may execute him for the soul of his brother whom he killed; and we will destroy the heir also. Thus they would extinguish my ember that is left, and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant upon the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.8'>And the king said to the woman, Go to your house, and I will give command concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.9'>And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king, let the iniquity be on me and on my fathers house, and the king and his throne be guiltless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.10'>And the king said, Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.11'>And she said, Please let the king remember Jehovah your God, and do not permit the avenger of blood to destroy anymore, that they not destroy my son. And he said, As Jehovah lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.12'>Then the woman said, Please, let your handmaid speak another word to my lord the king. And he said, Speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.13'>And the woman said: Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For the king speaks this thing as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring his banished one home again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.14'>For we die the death and are like water poured on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not take away a soul; but has devised plans, so that His banished ones are not thrust away from Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.15'>Now therefore, I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. And your handmaid thought, I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will carry out the word of his handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.16'>For the king will hear and deliver his handmaid from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.17'>And your handmaid thought, The word of my lord the king will now be comforting; for as the angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and evil. And Jehovah your God be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.18'>Then the king answered and said to the woman, Please do not hide from me anything that I am asking you. And the woman said, Let my lord the king speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.19'>So the king said, Is the hand of Joab with you in all this? And the woman answered and said, As you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. For your servant Joab has commanded me, and he has put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.20'>In order to change around the face of this matter your servant Joab has done this thing; but my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all that is in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.21'>And the king said to Joab, Behold, I have done this thing. Go therefore, bring back the young man Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.22'>And Joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself, and blessed the king. And Joab said, Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, O king, in that the king has done the word of his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.23'>So Joab rose up and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.24'>And the king said, Let him return to his own house, but he shall not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, but did not see the kings face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.25'>Now in all Israel there was no one as handsome as Absalom, and highly praised. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.26'>And when he shaved his head (at the end of a year of days he shaved it because it was heavy on him; therefore he shaved it), he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels according to the kings weight stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.27'>And to Absalom were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a woman of beautiful appearance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.28'>And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and did not see the kings face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.29'>Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. And when he sent again the second time, he would not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.30'>So he said to his servants, Behold, Joabs field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absaloms servants set the field on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.31'>Then Joab arose and came to Absaloms house, and said to him, Why have your servants set my field on fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.32'>And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come here, so that I may send you to the king, to say, Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still. Now therefore, let me see the kings face; but if there is iniquity in me, let him put me to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.33'>So Joab went to the king and reported to him. And when he had summoned Absalom, he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.15'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.1'>After this it happened that Absalom provided himself with chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.2'>And Absalom would rise early and stand beside the way to the gate. And so it was, whenever anyone who had a dispute came to the king for judgment, that Absalom would call to him and say, What city are you from? And he would say, Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.3'>Then Absalom would say to him, Behold, your case is good and right; but there is no one from the king to hear you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.4'>Moreover Absalom would say, Oh, that I were made judge in the land, and everyone who has a dispute or case could come to me, and I would give him justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.5'>And so it was, whenever anyone came near to bow down to him, that he put out his hand and took him and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.6'>In this manner Absalom acted toward all Israel who came to the king for judgment. Thus Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.7'>And it came to pass after forty years that Absalom said to the king, Please, let me go to Hebron and pay the vow which I have vowed unto Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.8'>For your servant has vowed a vow while I dwelt at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah brings me back to Jerusalem, then I shall serve Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.9'>And the king said to him, Go in peace. So he arose and went to Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.10'>But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the shofar, then you shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.11'>And with Absalom went two hundred men invited from Jerusalem, and they went along innocently and did not know anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.12'>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, Davids counselor, from his city, from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people with Absalom continually increased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.13'>And a messenger came to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.14'>And David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; or we shall not escape before Absalom. Make haste to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.15'>And the kings servants said to the king, We are your servants, ready to do whatever my lord the king decides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.16'>And the king went out with all his household at his feet. But the king left ten women, concubines, to keep the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.17'>And the king went out with all the people at his feet, and stopped at the last house of the settlement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.18'>And all his servants passed before him; and all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had followed him from Gath, were passing on before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.19'>Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why are you also going with us? Return to your place and remain with the king. For you are a foreigner and also an exile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.20'>You came only recently. Should I make you go here and there with us this day, since I am going wherever I can? Return, and take your brethren back. Mercy and truth be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.21'>And Ittai answered the king and said, As Jehovah lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in whatever place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also your servant will be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.22'>And David said to Ittai, Go, and cross over. Then Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the little ones who were with him crossed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.23'>And all the land was weeping with a loud voice, and all the people were crossing over. The king himself also crossed over the Brook Kidron, and all the people crossed over toward the way of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.24'>And behold Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar went up until all the people had finished crossing over out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.25'>And the king said to Zadok, Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Jehovah, He will bring me back and show me both it and His dwelling place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.26'>But if He says thus: I have not delighted in you, then behold, here am I, let Him do to me as is good in His eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.27'>The king also said to Zadok the priest, Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.28'>See, I will wait in the plains of the wilderness until word comes from you to report to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.29'>Therefore Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem. And they remained there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.30'>And David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went up; and he had his head covered and was going barefoot. And all the people with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.31'>And someone reported to David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Jehovah, I pray, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.32'>And it happened when David had come to the top of the mountain, where he bowed down before God, that behold Hushai the Archite was coming to meet him with his tunic torn and earth on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.33'>And David said to him, If you go on with me, then you will become a burden to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.34'>But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I was your fathers servant previously, so I will now also be your servant, then you may frustrate the counsel of Ahithophel for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.35'>And do you not have Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? Therefore it will be that whatever you hear from the kings house, you shall report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.36'>Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadoks son, and Jonathan, Abiathars son; and by their hands you shall send to me everything you hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.37'>So Hushai, Davids friend, went into the city. And Absalom came into Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.16'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.1'>And when David was a little past the top of the mountain, behold Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred clusters of raisins, one hundred summer fruits, and a skin of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.2'>And the king said to Ziba, What do you mean by these? And Ziba said, The donkeys are for the kings household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for those who are faint in the wilderness to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.3'>And the king said, And where is your masters son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he has said, Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.4'>Then the king said to Ziba, Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours. And Ziba said, I prostrate before you, that I may find favor in your eyes, my lord, O king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.5'>And when King David came to Bahurim, there was a man from the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei the son of Gera, coming from there. He came out, cursing continuously as he came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.6'>And he pelted David and all the servants of King David with stones. And all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.7'>Also Shimei said thus when he cursed: Get out! Get out, you man of blood, you worthless man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.8'>Jehovah has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and Jehovah has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son. So now you are caught in your own evil, because you are a man of blood!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.9'>Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please, let me go over and take off his head!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.10'>But the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because Jehovah has said to him, Curse David. Who then shall say, Why have you done so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.11'>And David said to Abishai and all his servants, See how my son who came from my own body seeks my life; so, why not this Benjamite? Let him alone, and let him curse; for thus Jehovah has commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.12'>It may be that Jehovah will look on my affliction, and that Jehovah will repay me with good for his cursing this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.13'>And as David and his men went along the way, Shimei went along the hillside across from him and cursed as he went, pelted him with stones and kicked up dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.14'>And the king and all the people with him became weary; so they refreshed themselves there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.15'>Meanwhile Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, had come to Jerusalem; and Ahithophel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.16'>And so it was, when Hushai the Archite, Davids friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, Long live the king! Long live the king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.17'>And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why have you not gone with your friend?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.18'>And Hushai said to Absalom, No, but whom Jehovah and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I shall be, and with him I shall remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.19'>Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should I not serve before his son? As I have served before your father, so shall I be before your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.20'>And Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give counsel as to what we shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.21'>And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your fathers concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you have become odious to your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.22'>So they spread out a tent for Absalom on the housetop, and Absalom went in to his fathers concubines before the eyes of all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.23'>Now the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if one had inquired at the Word of God. So was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.17'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.1'>Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Now let me choose twelve thousand men, and I shall arise and pursue David tonight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.2'>I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and make him afraid. And all the people who are with him will flee, and I will strike only the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.3'>Then I shall bring back all the people to you. When all return, except the man whom you seek, all the people shall be at peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.4'>And the words were agreeable to the eyes of Absalom and all the elders of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.5'>And Absalom said, Now call Hushai the Archite also, and we shall hear from his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.6'>And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken according to these words. Shall we do as he says? If not, speak up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.7'>And Hushai said to Absalom: The counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good at this time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.8'>For, said Hushai, you know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are bitter of soul, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field; and your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.9'>Behold now, he is hidden in some pit, or in some other place. And it will be, when some of them fall at first, that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.10'>And even he who is valiant, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will faint and melt away. For all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.11'>Therefore I counsel that all Israel be assembled and gathered to you, from Dan to Beer-sheba, like the sand that is by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.12'>Thus we shall come upon him in some place where he may be found, and we shall fall upon him as the dew falls on the ground. And of him and all the men who are with him there shall not be left so much as one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.13'>Moreover, if he has withdrawn into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city; and we shall pull it into the river, until there is not one pebble found there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.14'>So Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Jehovah had purposed to frustrate the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Jehovah might bring calamity upon Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.15'>And Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, Thus and so has Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and so I have counseled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.16'>Now therefore, send quickly and report to David, saying, Do not spend the night by the fords of the plains of the wilderness, but quickly cross over, that the king and all the people with him not be swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.17'>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed at En Rogel, for they dared not be seen coming into the city; so a slave girl came and reported to them, and they went and reported to King David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.18'>Nevertheless a lad saw them, and reported to Absalom. But both of them went away quickly and came to a mans house in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.19'>And the woman took and spread a covering over the wells mouth, and spread ground grain on it; and the thing was not discovered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.20'>And when Absaloms servants came to the woman at the house, they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, They have crossed over the water brook. And when they had searched and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.21'>Now it came to pass, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well and went and reported to King David, and said to David, Arise and cross over the water quickly; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.22'>So David and all the people with him arose and crossed over the Jordan. By morning light not one of them was left who had not crossed over the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.23'>And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not carried out, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city, put his house in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his fathers tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.24'>Then David went to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.25'>And Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. This Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Jithra, an Israelite, who had gone in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joabs mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.26'>So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.27'>And it happened, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the children of Ammon, Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.28'>brought beds and basins, earthen vessels and wheat, barley and flour, roasted grain and beans, lentils and roasted seeds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.29'>honey and curds, sheep and cheese of the herd, for David and the people who were with him to eat. For they said, The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.18'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.1'>And David mustered the people who were with him, and appointed commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.2'>And David sent out one third of the people under the hand of Joab, one third under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joabs brother, and one third under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I shall proceed to go out with you myself also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.3'>But the people answered, You shall not go out! For if we flee away, they will not care about us; nor if half of us die, will they care about us; for you are like ten thousand of us now. You are now more help to us in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.4'>And the king said to them, I will do what is good in your eyes. So the king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.5'>And the king commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom. And all the people heard when the king charged the commanders concerning Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.6'>So the people went out into the field to meet Israel. And the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.7'>The people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.8'>And the battle was scattered over the face of all the land, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword had devoured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.9'>And Absalom was encountered before the servants of David. Absalom was riding on a mule, the mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth tree, and his head caught in the terebinth; so he was left hanging between the heavens and earth; and the mule which was under him went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.10'>And a certain man saw it and reported to Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth tree!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.11'>And Joab said to the man who reported to him, Behold, you have seen; and why did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a belt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.12'>And the man said to Joab, Though I were to receive a thousand shekels of silver in my hand, I would not put forth my hand against the kings son. For in our ears the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Take heed that no one touches the young man Absalom!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.13'>Otherwise I would have dealt falsely against my own soul. For there is nothing hidden from the king, and you yourself would have set yourself against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.14'>And Joab said, I cannot wait before you. And he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through Absaloms heart, while he was still alive in the midst of the terebinth tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.15'>And ten young men who bore Joabs armor surrounded Absalom, and struck and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.16'>And Joab blew the shofar, and the people returned from pursuing Israel. For Joab had held back the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.17'>And they took Absalom and cast him into a large pit in the forest, and laid a very large heap of stones over him. And all Israel fled, everyone to his tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.18'>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up a pillar for himself, which is in the Kings Valley; for he thought, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance. He called the pillar after his own name. And to this day it is called Absaloms Monument.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.19'>Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, Let me run now and bear good news to the king, how Jehovah has avenged him of his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.20'>And Joab said to him, You are not the man for tidings this day, but you shall bear good news another day. But today you shall not bear good news, because the kings son is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.21'>Then Joab said to Cushi, Go, tell the king what you have seen. So Cushi bowed himself to Joab and ran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.22'>And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, But whatever happens, please let me also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Why will you run, my son, since you have no news ready?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.23'>But whatever the case, he said, Let me run. So he said to him, Run. And Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain, and outran Cushi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.24'>Now David was sitting between the two gates. And the watchman went up to the roof over the gate, to the wall, lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was running alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.25'>And the watchman cried out and reported to the king. And the king said, If he is alone, there is news in his mouth. And he proceeded to come and drew near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.26'>Then the watchman saw another man running, and the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said, There is another man running alone! And the king said, He also brings news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.27'>And the watchman said, It looks like the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and comes with good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.28'>And Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, Peace! And he bowed down with his face to the earth to the king, and said, Blessed is Jehovah your God, who has delivered up the men who had lifted up their hand against my lord the king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.29'>And king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the kings servant and me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I did not know what it was about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.30'>And the king said, Turn aside and stand here. So he turned aside and remained standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.31'>And then Cushi came, and Cushi said, Good news, my lord the king! For Jehovah has avenged you this day of all those who were rising up against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.32'>And the king said to Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who have risen up against you to do harm, be like that young man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.33'>And the king was disquieted, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went, he said thus: O my son Absalom; my son, my son Absalom; O that I had died in your place! O Absalom my son, my son!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.19'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.1'>And it was reported to Joab, Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.2'>So the deliverance that day was turned into mourning for all the people. For the people heard it said that day, The king is grieved for his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.3'>And the people stole back into the city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.4'>And the king had covered his face, and the king cried out with a loud voice, O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.5'>And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Today you have shamed the faces of all your servants who today have delivered your soul, the souls of your sons and daughters, the souls of your wives and the souls of your concubines,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.6'>to love your enemies and hate your friends. For you have declared today that you regard neither princes nor servants; for today I perceive that if Absalom had lived and all of us had died today, that it would have pleased you well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.7'>Now therefore, arise, go out and speak to the heart of your servants. For I swear by Jehovah, if you do not go out, not one will stay with you this night. And that will be worse for you than all the evil that has befallen you from your youth until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.8'>And the king arose and sat in the gate. And they announced to all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate. So all the people came before the king. For everyone of Israel had fled to his tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.9'>Now all the people were in a dispute throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king has rescued us out of the hand of our enemies, he has delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines, and now he has fled from the land because of Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.10'>But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. Now therefore, why are you being silent to bring back the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.11'>So King David sent to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house, since the words of all Israel have come to the king, to his house?</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.17'>And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they had rushed over the Jordan before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.18'>And a ferryboat went across to carry over the kings household, and to do good in his eyes. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king when he had crossed the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.19'>And he said to the king, Do not let my lord impute iniquity to me, nor remember how your servant acted perversely on the day that my lord the king left Jerusalem, that the king should take it to heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.20'>For I, your servant, know that I have sinned. Therefore, behold, I am the first to come today of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.21'>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the anointed of Jehovah?</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.23'>Therefore the king said to Shimei, You shall not die. And the king swore to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.24'>And Mephibosheth the son of Saul had come down to meet the king. And he had not attended to his feet, nor done his mustache, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he returned in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.25'>And it came to pass, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.26'>And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, I will saddle a donkey for myself, that I may ride on it and go to the king, because your servant is lame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.27'>And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king, but my lord the king is like the angel of God. Therefore do what is good in your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.28'>For all my fathers house were but dead men before my lord the king. Yet you set your servant among those who eat at your own table. Therefore what right have I still to cry out anymore to the king?</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.34'>But Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.35'>I am today eighty years old. Can I discern between the good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any longer the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be a further burden to my lord the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.36'>Your servant will go a little way across the Jordan with the king. And why should the king repay me with such a reward?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.37'>Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, near the grave of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what is good in your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.38'>And the king answered, Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him what is good in your eyes. And whatever you choose of me, I will do for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.39'>And all the people went over the Jordan. And when the king had crossed over, the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.40'>And the king passed on over to Gilgal, and Chimham passed along with him. And all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.41'>And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brethren, the men of Judah, stolen you away and brought the king, his household, and all Davids men with him across the Jordan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.42'>So all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is next of kin to us. Why then are you angry over this matter? Have we ever eaten at the kings expense? Or has he given us any gift?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.43'>And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king; therefore we also have more in David than you. Why then have you despised us; were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king? Yet the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.1'>And there met them there a man of worthlessness, whose name was Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjamite. And he blew a shofar, and said: We have no part in David, nor do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse; every man to his tents, O Israel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.2'>So every man of Israel withdrew from David, and followed after Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah, from the Jordan as far as Jerusalem, stayed close to their king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.3'>And David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten women, his concubines whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in confinement and sustained them, but did not go in to them.

        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.4'>And the king said to Amasa, Assemble the men of Judah for me within three days, and present yourself.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.8'>When they were at the large stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came before them. Now Joab was dressed in battle armor; on it was a belt with a sword fastened in its sheath at his hips; and as he went forth, it fell out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.9'>Then Joab said to Amasa, Are you in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.15'>And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maachah; and they cast up a siege mound against the city, and it stood by the rampart. And all the people who were with Joab were destroying the wall to throw it down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.16'>Then a wise woman cried out from the city, Hear, Hear! Please say to Joab, Come nearby, that I may speak with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.17'>When he had come near to her, the woman said, Are you Joab? He answered, I am. Then she said to him, Hear the words of your handmaid. And he answered, I am listening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.18'>So she spoke, saying, They used to talk in former times, saying, They shall inquire to ask at Abel, and thus they would end the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.19'>I am among the peaceable and faithful in Israel. You are seeking to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.21'>That is not so. But a man from the mountains of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David.

        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.22'>And the woman in her wisdom went to all the people. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. Then he blew a shofar, and they withdrew from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to the king at Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.1'>Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David besought the face of Jehovah. And Jehovah answered, It is because of Saul and his bloody house, because he had killed the Gibeonites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.2'>So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites. The children of Israel had sworn peace to them, but Saul had sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.3'>Therefore David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of Jehovah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.4'>And the Gibeonites said to him, We will have no silver or gold from Saul or from his house, nor shall you kill any man in Israel for us. So he said, Whatever you say, I will do for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.5'>And they answered the king, As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us, that we should be annihilated from remaining in any of the territories of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.6'>let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them before Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul, whom Jehovah chose. And the king said, I will deliver them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.7'>But the king spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath of Jehovah that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.8'>So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she had borne to Saul; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.9'>and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before Jehovah. So they fell, all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.10'>Now Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until the waters poured on them from the heavens.

        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.11'>And David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.12'>And David went and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, from the men of Jabesh Gilead who had stolen them from the town square of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hung them up, after the Philistines had struck down Saul in Gilboa.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.15'>And the Philistines were at war again with Israel. And David and his servants with him went down and fought against the Philistines; and David grew faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.16'>And Ishbi-Benob, who was of the sons of the giants, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of bronze, who was bearing a new sword, intended to kill David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.17'>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, You shall go out no more with us to battle, that you not quench the lamp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.18'>And it happened after this that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was of the sons of the giants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.19'>Again there was war at Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed one from Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weavers beam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.20'>Yet again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also was born to the giants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.21'>And when he reproached Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, Davids brother, killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.22'>These four were born to the giants in Gath, and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.1'>Now these are the last words of David. Thus says David the son of Jesse; thus says the man raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.2'>The Spirit of Jehovah has spoken by me, and His Word was on my tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.3'>The God of Israel has said, the Rock of Israel has spoken to me: He who rules over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.4'>And he shall be like the light of the morning when the sun rises, a morning without clouds, like the tender grass springing out of the earth, by clear shining after rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.5'>Although my house is not so with the Mighty God, yet He has made with me a perpetual covenant, ordered in all things and secure. For all my salvation and all my desire, will He not make it grow?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.6'>But the sons of worthlessness shall all be as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.7'>But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear, and they shall be burned with fire to be burned in their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.8'>These are the names of Davids mighty men: Josheb-Basshebeth the Tachmonite, chief among the commanders. He was called Adino the Eznite, because he killed eight hundred men at one time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.9'>And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel retreated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.10'>He rose up and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clung to the sword. Jehovah brought about a great deliverance that day; and the people returned after him only to plunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.11'>And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines had gathered together into a troop where there was a piece of ground full of lentils, and the people had fled before the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.12'>But he took his stand in the middle of the plot, delivered it, and struck the Philistines. And Jehovah brought about a great deliverance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.13'>And three of the thirty chief men went down at harvest time and came to David at the cave of Adullam. And the company of the Philistines encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.14'>David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.15'>And David longed and said, Oh, that someone would give me a drink of the water from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.16'>So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and took it and brought it to David. Nevertheless he would not drink it, but poured it out to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.17'>And he said, Far be it from me, O Jehovah, that I should do this! Should I drink the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their souls? Therefore he would not drink it. These things were done by the three mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.18'>And Abishai the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of another three. He lifted his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and won a name among these three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.19'>Was he not the most honored of three? Therefore he became their commander. However, he did not attain to the first three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.20'>Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who had done many deeds. He had killed two from Moab that were like lions. He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.21'>And he killed an Egyptian, a spectacular man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand; so he went down to him with a staff, wrested the spear out of the Egyptians hand, and killed him with his own spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.22'>These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and won a name among three mighty ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.23'>He was more honored than the thirty, but he had not attained to the first three. And David appointed him over his guard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.24'>Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.25'>Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.26'>Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.27'>Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.28'>Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.29'>Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai from Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.30'>Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai from the brooks of Gaash,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.31'>Abi-Albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.32'>Eliahba the Shaalbonite (of the sons of Jashen), Jonathan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.33'>Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.34'>Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.35'>Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.36'>Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.37'>Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite (armorbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah),</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.38'>Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.39'>and Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.24'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.1'>Again the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel, and He moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.2'>So the king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him, Now go throughout all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beer-sheba, and number the people, that I may know the number of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.3'>And Joab said to the king, Now may Jehovah your God add to the people a hundred times more than there are, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king desire this thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.4'>Nevertheless the kings word prevailed against Joab and against the commanders of the army. Therefore Joab and the commanders of the army went out from before the king to number the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.5'>And they crossed over the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the right side of the town which is in the midst of the valley of Gad, and toward Jazer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.6'>Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; they came to Dan Jaan and around to Sidon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.7'>and they came to the stronghold of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Then they went out to the south of Judah as far as Beer-sheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.8'>So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.9'>And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the king. And there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.10'>And Davids heart was smitten after he had numbered the people. So David said to Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in what I have done; but now, I pray, O Jehovah, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.11'>And when David arose in the morning, the Word of Jehovah came to the prophet Gad, Davids seer, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.12'>Go and say to David, Thus says Jehovah: I am setting before you three things; choose one of them for yourself, and I will do it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.13'>So Gad came to David and reported to him; and he said to him, Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or shall you flee three months before your enemies, while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days of plague in your land? Now consider and see what word I shall take back to Him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.14'>And David said to Gad, I am in great distress. Let us fall now into the hand of Jehovah, for His mercies are great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.15'>So Jehovah sent a plague upon Israel from the morning till the appointed time. From Dan to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men of the people died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.16'>And when the Angel stretched out His hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah was moved to compassion regarding the evil, and said to the Angel who was destroying the people, Enough! Now restrain your hand. And the Angel of Jehovah was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.17'>Then David spoke to Jehovah when he saw the Angel who was striking the people, and said, Surely I have sinned, and I have committed iniquity; but these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, be against me and against my fathers house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.18'>And Gad came that day to David and said to him, Go up, build an altar unto Jehovah on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.19'>And David, according to the word of Gad, went up as Jehovah commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.20'>And Araunah looked and saw the king and his servants crossing over toward him. So Araunah went out and bowed before the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.21'>And Araunah said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing floor from you, to build an altar unto Jehovah, that the plague may be restrained from the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.22'>And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up whatever is good in his eyes. Behold, the oxen for the burnt offering, and the threshing implements and the yokes of the oxen for wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.23'>All these, O king, Araunah has given to the king. And Araunah said to the king, May Jehovah your God accept you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.24'>And the king said to Araunah, No, but I will buy to acquire it from you for a price; nor will I offer burnt offerings unto Jehovah my God for free. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.25'>And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And Jehovah was entreated for the land, and the plague was restrained from Israel.</verse>
