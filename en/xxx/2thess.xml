      <chapter osisID='2Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'>Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all abounds toward each other,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>so that we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and afflictions that you endure,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>which is manifest evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>since it is righteous judgment with God to repay with affliction those who trouble you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>and to give you who are afflicted rest with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from Heaven with His mighty angels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>in flaming fire giving full vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>These shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>when He comes, in that Day, to be glorified in His saints and to be admired among all those who believe, because our testimony among you is believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>Therefore we also pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of His goodness and the work of faith with power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>Now brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of our gathering together to Him, we ask you</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>not to be quickly disturbed in mind or alarmed, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the Day of Christ has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is unveiled, the son of perdition,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is honored, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, declaring of himself that he is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>And now you know what is restraining, that he may be unveiled in his own time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only He is now restraining, until it is raised from out of the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>And then the lawless one will be unveiled, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>and with all unrighteous deception among those who are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>But we owe thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God from the beginning chose you for salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>to which He called you through our gospel, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'>Therefore, brethren, stand firm and hold on to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us and given us everlasting comfort and good hope by grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'>encourage your hearts and establish you in every good word and work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'>Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may run freely and be glorified, just as it is with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'>and that we may be delivered from evil and wicked men; for not all have faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'>But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'>And we are persuaded in the Lord concerning you, both that you do and will do the things we command you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'>Now may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'>But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the teaching which you received from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'>For you yourselves know how you need to imitate our example, for we were not disorderly among you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'>nor did we eat anyones bread free of charge, but worked with labor and toil night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>not because we do not have authority, but to make ourselves an example of how you should imitate us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone does not desire to work, neither shall he eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>For we hear that there are some who walk among you in a disorderly manner, not working at all, but are busybodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>Now those who are such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ that they work in quietness and eat their own bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'>But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary in doing good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'>And if anyone does not obey our word in this epistle, note that person and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'>Yet do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'>Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'>The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is a sign in every epistle; so I write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</verse>
