      <chapter osisID='Judg.1'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.1'>Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass that the children of Israel asked Jehovah, saying, Who shall first go up for us against the Canaanites to fight against them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.2'>And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up. Behold I have delivered the land into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.3'>And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me to my allotted territory, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I will likewise go with you to your allotted territory. And Simeon went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.4'>And Judah went up, and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they struck ten thousand men at Bezek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.5'>And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him; and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.6'>And Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.7'>And Adoni-Bezek said, Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has repaid me. Then they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.8'>Now the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it; they struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.9'>And afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the mountains, in the south, and in the lowlands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.10'>Then Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron. (Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kirjath Arba.) And they killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.11'>From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir was formerly Kirjath Sepher.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.12'>And Caleb said, Whoever strikes Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give my daughter Achsah as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.13'>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Calebs younger brother, took it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.14'>And it happened, when she came to him, that she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, What do you wish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.15'>And she said to him, Give me a blessing; since you have given me land in the south, give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.16'>Now the children of the Kenite, Moses father-in-law, had gone up from the City of Palms with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.17'>And Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.18'>Judah also took Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.19'>Thus Jehovah was with Judah. And they dispossessed the mountains, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the lowland, because they had chariots of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.20'>And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said. And he dispossessed from there the three sons of Anak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.21'>But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.22'>And the house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and Jehovah was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.23'>And the house of Joseph sent men to spy out Bethel. (The name of the city was formerly Luz.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.24'>And when the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, Please show us the entrance to the city, and we will deal kindly with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.25'>So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.26'>And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.27'>However, Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its daughter-villages, or Taanach and its daughter-villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its daughter-villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its daughter-villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its daughter-villages; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.28'>And it came to pass, when Israel had become strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not drive out to dispossess them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.29'>Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.30'>Nor did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and were put to tribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.31'>Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.32'>But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.33'>Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but they dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. And the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were put to tribute under them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.34'>And the Amorites squeezed the children of Dan into the mountains, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.35'>but the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; yet when the hand of the house of Joseph became heavy, they were put to tribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.36'>And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.2'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.1'>And the Angel of Jehovah came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said: I led you up from Egypt and brought you into the land of which I had sworn to your fathers; and I said, I will never break My covenant with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.2'>And you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall pull down their altars. But you have not obeyed My voice. Why have you done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.3'>Therefore I also have said, I will not drive them out before you; but they shall be thorns in your side, and their gods shall be a snare to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.4'>And it came about, when the Angel of Jehovah spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voices and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.5'>Thus they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there unto Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.6'>And when Joshua had dismissed the people, the children of Israel went each to his own inheritance to possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.7'>Thus the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who prolonged their days after Joshua, who had seen all the great works of Jehovah which He had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.8'>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died when he was one hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.9'>And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Heres, in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.10'>When all that generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who had not known Jehovah nor the work which He had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.11'>And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and served the Baals;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.12'>and they forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; and they went after other gods from among the gods of the people who were all around them, and they bowed down to them; and they provoked Jehovah to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.13'>They forsook Jehovah and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.14'>And the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of plunderers who plundered them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.15'>Wherever they went out, the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had said, and as Jehovah had sworn to them. And they were greatly distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.16'>Nevertheless, Jehovah raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.17'>Yet they would not heed their judges, but they committed adultery with other gods, and bowed down to them. They turned quickly from the way in which their fathers had walked, to obey the commandments of Jehovah; they did not do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.18'>And when Jehovah raised up judges for them, Jehovah was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for Jehovah was moved to pity before their groaning because of those oppressing and thrusting at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.19'>And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they would turn back and act more corruptly than their fathers, by going after other gods, to serve them and bow down to them. They have not failed from their own doings nor from their stubborn way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.20'>And the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel; and He said, Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I have commanded their fathers, and has not obeyed My voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.21'>I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua has left when he died,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.22'>so that through them I may test Israel, whether they will keep the way of Jehovah, to walk in it as their fathers have kept it, or not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.23'>Therefore Jehovah left those nations, without driving them out quickly; nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.3'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.1'>Now these are the nations which Jehovah left, that He might test Israel by them, that is, all who had not known any of the wars in Canaan</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.2'>(only so that the generations of the sons of Israel might be taught to know war, at least those who had not formerly known it),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.3'>namely, five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who dwelt in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.4'>And they were left, that He might test Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commandments of Jehovah, which He had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.5'>Thus the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.6'>And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons; and they served their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.7'>And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of Jehovah. They forgot Jehovah their God, and served the Baals and groves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.8'>Therefore the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan-Rishathaim eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.9'>And when the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised up a deliverer for the children of Israel, who delivered them: Othniel the son of Kenaz, Calebs younger brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.10'>And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and Jehovah delivered Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed over Cushan-Rishathaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.11'>And the land had rest for forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.12'>And the children of Israel again did evil in the eyes of Jehovah. So Jehovah strengthened Eglon king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the eyes of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.13'>And he gathered to himself the sons of Ammon and Amalek, went and struck Israel, and took possession of the City of Palm Trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.14'>And the children of Israel served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.15'>And when the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised up a deliverer for them: Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man with his right hand impeded. By him the children of Israel sent tribute to Eglon king of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.16'>Now Ehud made himself a sword (it was double-edged and a cubit in length) and girded it under his clothes on his right thigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.17'>And he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. (Now Eglon was a very fat man.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.18'>And when he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who were carrying the tribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.19'>But he himself turned back from the graven images that were at Gilgal, and said, I have a secret matter for you, O king. He said, Keep silence. And all who were standing by him went out from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.20'>And Ehud came to him (now he was sitting upstairs in his cool roof chamber). And Ehud said, I have a word from God for you. So he arose from his seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.21'>And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.22'>And the hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly; and his excrement came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.23'>Then Ehud went out through the porch and shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.24'>And when he had gone out, his servants came to look, and behold, the doors of the upper room were locked. And they thought, Surely he is covering his feet in the cool chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.25'>So they waited till they were ashamed, and behold he was not opening the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened them. And behold, their master was fallen dead on the floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.26'>And Ehud had escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the graven images and slipped away to Seirah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.27'>And it happened, when he arrived, that he blew the shofar in the mountains of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel came down with him from the mountains, with him before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.28'>And he said to them, Follow me, for Jehovah has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. So they went down after him, seized the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.29'>And at that time they struck about ten thousand men of Moab, all stout men of valor; not a man escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.30'>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.31'>After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad; and he also delivered Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.4'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.1'>When Ehud was dead, the children of Israel again did evil in the eyes of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.2'>And Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth Hagoyim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.3'>And the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and for twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.4'>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, was judging Israel at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.5'>And she was dwelling under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. And the children of Israel went up to her for judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.6'>And she sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, Has not Jehovah the God of Israel commanded: Go and proceed to Mount Tabor; take with you ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.7'>and I will draw out to you Sisera, the commander of Jabins army, with his chariots and his multitude at the River Kishon; and I will deliver him into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.8'>And Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.9'>And she said, I will walk to go with you; nevertheless there will be no glory for you in the journey you are taking, for Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.10'>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; he went up with ten thousand men at his feet, and Deborah went up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.11'>Now Heber the Kenite, of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent near the plain at Zaanaim, near Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.12'>And they reported to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.13'>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth Hagoyim to the River Kishon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.14'>And Deborah said to Barak, Up! For this is the day in which Jehovah has delivered Sisera into your hand. Has not Jehovah gone out before you? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men behind him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.15'>And Jehovah routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.16'>But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth Hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not one was left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.17'>However, Sisera had fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.18'>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; do not fear. And when he had turned aside to her into the tent, she covered him with a blanket.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.19'>And he said to her, Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty. So she opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.20'>And he said to her, Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, Is there any man here? you shall say, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.21'>Then Jael, Hebers wife, took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went down into the ground; for he was fast asleep and weary. Thus he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.22'>And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, I will show you the man whom you are seeking. And when he went into her tent, behold, Sisera was lying dead with the peg in his temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.23'>So on that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.24'>And the hand of the sons of Israel continued and proceeded to grow stronger against Jabin king of Canaan, until they had cut off Jabin king of Canaan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.5'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.1'>Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.2'>When commanders lead in Israel, when the people willingly offer themselves, bless Jehovah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.3'>Hear, O kings! Give ear, O princes! I, even I, will sing unto Jehovah; I will make music unto Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.4'>Jehovah, when You went out from Seir, when You marched from the field of Edom, the earth trembled and the heavens dropped, even the clouds dropped water;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.6.1'>And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of Jehovah. So Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.2'>and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. In the face of the Midianites, the children of Israel made for themselves the dens, the caves, and the strongholds which are in the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.3'>So it was that when Israel had sown, the Midianites would come up; also Amalekites and the sons of the East would come up against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.4'>And they would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep nor ox nor donkey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.5'>For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, coming in as numerous as the abundance of locusts; both they and their camels were without number; and they would enter the land to destroy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.6'>And Israel was brought exceedingly low before Midian, and the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.7'>And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried out to Jehovah because of the Midianites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.8'>that Jehovah sent a man who was a prophet unto the children of Israel, who said to them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: I have brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.9'>and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.10'>Also I said to you, I am Jehovah your God; do not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But you have not obeyed My voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.11'>And the Angel of Jehovah came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon was threshing wheat in the winepress, in order to hide it from before the Midianites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.12'>And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him, and said to him, Jehovah is with you, you mighty man of valor!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.13'>Gideon said to Him, O my lord, if Jehovah is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, Did not Jehovah bring us up from Egypt? But now Jehovah has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.14'>And Jehovah turned to him and said, Go in this might of yours, and you shall deliver Israel from the hand of the Midianites. Have I not sent you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.15'>And he said to Him, O my Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Behold my company is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my fathers house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.6.19'>And Gideon went in and prepared a young goat, and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. The flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot; and he brought them out to Him under the terebinth tree and brought them near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.20'>And the Angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.21'>Then the Angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in His hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened bread; and fire rose up out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened bread. And the Angel of Jehovah departed out of his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.22'>And Gideon perceived that He was the Angel of Jehovah. And Gideon said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah! For I have seen the Angel of Jehovah face to face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.23'>And Jehovah said to him, Peace unto you; do not fear, you shall not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.24'>And Gideon built an altar there unto Jehovah, and called it Jehovah Shalom. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.25'>Now it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said to him, Take your fathers young bull, the second bull of seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal that your father has, and chop down the grove that is beside it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.26'>and build an altar unto Jehovah your God on top of this rock in the proper arrangement, and take the second bull and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the grove which you shall chop down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.27'>And Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as Jehovah had spoken to him. But because he feared his fathers household and the men of the city too much to do it by day, he did it by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.28'>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, there was the altar of Baal, torn down; and the grove that was beside it was chopped down, and the second bull was being offered on the altar which had been built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.29'>And they said to one another, Who has done this thing? And when they had inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.30'>Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has torn down the altar of Baal, and because he has chopped down the grove that was beside it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.31'>And Joash said to all who stood against him, Would you plead for Baal? Would you deliver him? Let the one who would plead for him be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been torn down!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.32'>Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he has torn down his altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.33'>Then all the Midianites and Amalekites, the sons of the east, gathered together; and they crossed over and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.34'>And the Spirit of Jehovah clothed Gideon; and he blew the shofar, and the Abiezrites assembled behind him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.35'>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, who also assembled behind him. He also sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.36'>And Gideon said to God, If You are delivering Israel by my hand as You have said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.37'>behold, I am putting a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that You will deliver Israel by my hand, as You have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.38'>And it was so. When he arose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece together, he wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.39'>Then Gideon said to God, Do not let Your anger burn against me, but let me speak just once more: Let me prove, I pray, just once more with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, but on all the ground let there be dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.40'>And God did so that night. It was dry on the fleece only, but there was dew on all the ground.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.7'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.1'>Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him arose early and encamped beside the well of Harod, so that the camp of the Midianites was on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.2'>And Jehovah said to Gideon, The people who are with you are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hands, that Israel not glorify itself against Me, saying, My own hand has delivered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.3'>Now therefore, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him turn back and depart early from Mount Gilead. And twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.4'>And Jehovah said to Gideon, The people are still too many; bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. And it shall be, that of whom I say to you, This one shall go with you, the same shall go with you; and of whomever I say to you, This one shall not go with you, the same shall not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.5'>So he brought the people down to the water. And Jehovah said to Gideon, Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set apart by himself; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.6'>And the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.7'>And Jehovah said to Gideon, By the three hundred men who lapped I will deliver you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the other people go, every man to his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.8'>So the people took provisions and their shofars in their hands. And he sent away all the rest of Israel, every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men. Now the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.9'>And it came to pass on the same night that Jehovah said to him, Rise up, go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.10'>But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.11'>and you shall hear what they say; and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp. And he went down with Purah his servant to the extremity of the armed men who were in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.12'>Now the Midianites and Amalekites, all the sons of the east, were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the seashore for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.13'>And when Gideon came, there was a man telling a dream to his companion. He said, I have dreamed a dream: Behold, a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian; it came to a tent and struck it so that it fell and overturned, and the tent lay flat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.14'>And his companion answered and said, This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel! Into his hand God has delivered Midian and the whole camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.15'>And so it was, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, that he bowed down. He returned to the camp of Israel, and said, Arise, for Jehovah has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.16'>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a shofar into each mans hand, with empty jars, and torches inside the jars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.17'>And he said to them, Look at me and do likewise; and behold, when I come to the edge of the camp you shall do as I do:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.18'>When I blow the shofar, I and all who are with me, then you also blow the shofars on every side of the whole camp, and say, For Jehovah and for Gideon!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.19'>So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just as they had posted the watch; and they blew the shofars and shattered the jars that were in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.20'>And the three companies blew the shofars and shattered the jars; they held the torches in their left hands and the shofars in their right hands for blowing; and they cried out, The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.21'>And each man stood in his place all around the camp; and the whole army ran and cried out and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.22'>And when the three hundred blew the shofars, Jehovah set every mans sword against his companion throughout the whole camp; and the army fled to Beth Acacia, toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.23'>And the men of Israel gathered together from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, and chased after the Midianites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.24'>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the mountains of Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and seize from them the waters as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan. And all the men of Ephraim gathered together and seized the waters as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.25'>And they captured two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued Midian and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.8'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.1'>Now the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you done this to us by not calling us when you went to fight with the Midianites? And they strongly complained against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.2'>So he said to them, What have I done now in comparison to you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.3'>God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. And what was I able to do in comparison to you? Then their anger toward him subsided when he spoke those words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.4'>And when Gideon came to the Jordan, he and the three hundred men with him crossed over, exhausted but still pursuing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.5'>And he said to the men of Succoth, Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.6'>And the rulers of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.7'>And Gideon said, Therefore, when Jehovah has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will thresh your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.8'>And he went up from there to Penuel and spoke to them in the same way. And the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.9'>So he also spoke to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come back in peace, I will tear down this tower!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.10'>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were at Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand, all who were left of all the army of the sons of the east; for one hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword had fallen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.11'>And Gideon went up by the way of those who dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah; and he struck the army while the camp felt secure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.12'>And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.13'>Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle at sunrise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.14'>And he seized a young man of the men of Succoth and inquired of him; and he wrote down for him the rulers of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.15'>And he came to the men of Succoth and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you have taunted me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your weary men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.16'>And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he gave knowledge to the men of Succoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.17'>And he tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.18'>And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor? And they answered, As you are, so were they; each one with the appearance of the son of a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.19'>And he said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As Jehovah lives, if you had let them live, I would not have killed you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.20'>And he said to Jether his firstborn, Rise up and kill them! But the youth would not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was still a youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.21'>So Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise up yourself, and kill us; for as a man is, so is his strength. So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels necks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.22'>Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule over us, both you and your son, and your sons son also; for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.8.24'>And Gideon said to them, I would make a request of you, that each of you would give me the earrings from his plunder. For they had gold earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.25'>And they answered, We will extend to give them. And they spread out a garment, and each man threw into it the earrings from his plunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.26'>And the weight of the gold earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments, pendants, and purple garments which were on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were around their camels necks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.27'>And Gideon made it into an ephod and set it up in his city, Ophrah. And all Israel committed adultery with it there. It became a snare to Gideon and to his house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.9.33'>And it shall be in the morning as the sun rises, that you shall rise up early and rush upon the city; and when he and the people with him come out against you, you shall do to them as your hand shall find to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.34'>So Abimelech and all the people with him rose by night, and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.35'>When Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance to the city gate, Abimelech and the people with him rose up from the ambush.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.9.48'>And Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people with him. And Abimelech took an ax in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it and laid it on his shoulder; then he said to the people with him, What you have seen me do, make haste and do as I have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.49'>So each of the people likewise cut down his own bough and followed Abimelech, put them against the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died, about a thousand men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.50'>Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he encamped against Thebez and took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.51'>But there was a strong tower in the middle of the city, and all the men and women, all the lords of the city, fled there and shut themselves in; and they went up to the top of the tower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.52'>So Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it; and he drew near the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.53'>And a certain woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelechs head and crushed his skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.54'>And he called quickly to the young man, his armorbearer, and said to him, Draw your sword and kill me, that they not say of me, A woman killed him. So his young man thrust him through, and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.55'>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed, every man to his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.56'>Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.57'>And all the evil of the men of Shechem God returned upon their own heads, and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.10.7'>So the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel; and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the sons of Ammon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.13.6'>And the woman came and told her husband, saying, A Man of God has come to me, and His countenance was like the countenance of the Angel of God, very awesome; but I did not ask Him where He was from, and He did not tell me His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.7'>And He said to me, Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. Now drink no wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.8'>Then Manoah prayed to Jehovah, and said, O my Lord, please let the Man of God whom You sent come to us again and teach us what we shall do for the boy who is to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.9'>And God heeded the voice of Manoah, and the Angel of God came to the woman again as she was sitting in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.13.11'>And Manoah arose and followed his wife. When he came to the Man, he said to Him, Are You the Man who spoke to the woman? And He said, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.12'>And Manoah said, Now let Your words come to pass! What are the ordinances for the boy, and what are his works?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.13'>And the Angel of Jehovah said to Manoah, Of all that I have said to the woman let her take heed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.13.20'>it happened as the flame went up toward the heavens from the altar; that the Angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar! And Manoah and his wife were watching this, and they fell on their faces to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.21'>And the Angel of Jehovah appeared no more to Manoah and his wife. Then Manoah knew that He was the Angel of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.22'>And Manoah said to his wife, We shall die the death, because we have seen God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.23'>But his wife said to him, If Jehovah had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things, nor would He have told us such things as these at this time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.24'>And the woman bore a son and called his name Samson; and the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.14'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.1'>Now Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.2'>So he went up and told his father and mother, saying, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore, get her for me as a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.3'>Then his father and mother said to him, Is there no woman among the daughters of your brethren, or among all my people, that you must go and get a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her for me, for she is pleasing to my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.4'>But his father and mother did not know that it was of Jehovah, that He was seeking an occasion against the Philistines. For at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.5'>So Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold, a young lion came roaring toward him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.6'>And the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon him, and he tore the lion apart as one would have torn apart a young goat, though he had nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.7'>Then he went down and talked with the woman; and she was pleasing in the eyes of Samson.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.8'>After some days, when he returned to take her, he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion. And behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the carcass of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.9'>And he took some of it in his hands and went along, eating. And when he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them, and they also ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.10'>So his father went down to the woman. And Samson gave a feast there, for young men usually did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.11'>And it happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.12'>And Samson said to them, Let me propound a riddle to you. If you expound to declare it to me within the seven days of the feast, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.13'>But if you are not able to declare it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing. And they said to him, Propound your riddle, that we may hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.14'>And he said to them: Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And for three days they were not able to expound the riddle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.15'>But it came to pass on the seventh day that they said to Samsons wife, Entice your husband, that he may expound the riddle to us, or else we will burn you and your fathers house with fire. Have you invited us in order to make us poor? Is that not so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.16'>Then Samsons wife wept before him, and said, You only hate me! You do not love me! You have propounded a riddle to the sons of my people, but you have not explained it to me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not expounded it to my father or my mother; so should I declare it to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.17'>And she wept before him the seven days while their feast lasted. And it happened on the seventh day that he told her, because she pressed him so much. And she declared the riddle to the sons of her people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.18'>And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down: What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? And he said to them: If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.19'>And the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck thirty of their men, took their apparel, and gave the changes of clothing to those who had declared the riddle; thus his anger burned. And he went up to his fathers house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.15.4'>And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes; and he took torches, turned tail to tail, and put a torch between the two tails.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.5'>When he had set the torches on fire, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both the shocks and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.6'>Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion. So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.7'>And Samson said to them, Since you did a thing like this, I shall avenge myself on you, and after that I will cease.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.15.9'>And the Philistines went up, encamped in Judah, and were spread out at Lehi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.10'>And the men of Judah said, Why have you come up against us? So they answered, We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.15.12'>But they said to him, We have come down to bind you, to deliver you into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.15.14'>When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting against him. And the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon him; and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that is burned with fire, and his bonds melted from his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.15'>And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and struck a thousand men with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.16'>Then Samson said: With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey I have slain a thousand men!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.17'>And so it was, when he had finished speaking, that he threw the jawbone from his hand, and called that place Ramath Lehi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.18'>And he became very thirsty; so he cried out to Jehovah and said, You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant; and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.16.8'>So the rulers of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh shoots, not yet dried, and she bound him with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.9'>Now men were lying in wait, staying with her in the room. And she said to him, The Philistines are upon you, Samson! But he broke the shoots as a strand of yarn breaks when it touches fire. So the secret of his strength was not known.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.16.18'>And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and summoned the rulers of the Philistines, saying, Come up once more, for he has told me all his heart. So the rulers of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.19'>And she made him sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. And she began to afflict him, and his strength depart from him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.17.3'>So when he had returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly consecrated the silver from my hand unto Jehovah for my son, to make a graven image, and a molten image; now therefore, I will return it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.4'>Thus he returned the silver to his mother. Then his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the silversmith, and he made it into a graven image, and a molten image; and they were in the house of Micah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.5'>And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod and household idols; and he confirmed the hand of one of his sons, who became his priest.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.18.8'>And the spies came back to their brethren at Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brethren said to them, What is your report?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.18.19'>And they said to him, Be quiet, put your hand over your mouth, and come with us; be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest to the household of one man, or that you be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.20'>So the priests heart was glad; and he took the ephod, the household idols, and the graven image, and went among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.21'>Then they turned and departed, and put the little ones, the livestock, and the goods before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.22'>When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micahs house gathered together and overtook the children of Dan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.23'>And they called out to the sons of Dan. So they turned their faces and said to Micah, What ails you, that you have assembled together?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.24'>And he said, You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and you have gone away. Now what more do I have? How can you say to me, What ails you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.25'>And the sons of Dan said to him, Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest men of bitter souls fall upon you, and you lose your soul, with the souls of your household!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.26'>And the children of Dan went their way. And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.27'>And they took what Micah had made, and the priest who had belonged to him, and went to Laish, to a people quiet and secure; and they struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.28'>There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no business with anyone. It was in the valley next to Beth Rehob. So they rebuilt the city and dwelt there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.29'>And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel. However, the name of the city formerly was Laish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.30'>And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image; and Jonathan the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.31'>And they set up for themselves Micahs graven image which he had made, all the days the house of God was in Shiloh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.19'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.1'>And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning in the remote areas of the mountains of Ephraim, who took a concubine for himself, a woman from Bethlehem in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.2'>But his concubine committed adultery against him, and went away from him to her fathers house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there four months of days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.3'>And her husband rose up and went after her, to speak to her heart, to bring her back, having his servant and a couple of donkeys with him. So she brought him into her fathers house; and when the father of the young woman saw him, he was glad to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.4'>And his father-in-law, the young womans father, detained him; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank and lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.5'>And it came to pass on the fourth day that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart; but the young womans father said to his son-in-law, Sustain your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.6'>So they sat down, and the two of them ate and drank together. Then the young womans father said to the man, Please accept my invitation to stay the night, and let your heart be merry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.7'>And when the man rose up to depart, his father-in-law pressed upon him; so he turned back and lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.8'>And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart, but the young womans father said, Please sustain your heart. So they delayed until afternoon; and both of them ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.9'>And when the man rose up to depart, he and his concubine and his servant, his father-in-law, the young womans father, said to him, Behold, the day is now drawing toward evening; please spend the night. Behold, the day is coming to an end; lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow go your way early, so that you may go to your tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.10'>However, the man was not willing to spend that night; so he rose up and departed, and came to a place opposite Jebus (which is, Jerusalem). With him were the two saddled donkeys; his concubine was also with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.11'>They were near Jebus, and the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, please, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.12'>But his master said to him, We will not turn aside here into a city of foreigners, who are not of the children of Israel; we will go on to Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.13'>And he said to his servant, Come, let us draw near to one of these places, and lodge in Gibeah or in Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.14'>And they passed by and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.15'>And they turned aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah. And when he went in, he sat down in the open place of the city, for no one received them into his house to lodge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.16'>And behold, an old man came in from his work in the field at evening, who also was from the mountains of Ephraim; he was sojourning in Gibeah, whereas the men of the place were Benjamites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.17'>And when he lifted up his eyes, he saw the traveling man in the open place of the city; and the old man said, Where are you going, and where do you come from?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.18'>And he said to him, We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah toward the remote areas of the mountains of Ephraim; I am from there. I went to Bethlehem in Judah; now I am going to the house of Jehovah. But no one is receiving me into his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.19'>even though we have both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for myself, for your handmaid, and for the young man who is with your servant; there is no lack of anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.20'>And the old man said, Peace to you! However, let all your needs be upon me; only do not spend the night in the open place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.21'>So he brought him into his house, and gave fodder to the donkeys. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.22'>Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, certain men of the city, sons of wickedness surrounded the house and beat on the door. They spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring out the man who has come to your house, that we may know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.23'>And the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, No, my brethren! I beg you, do not act so wickedly! Seeing this man has come into my house, do not do this disgraceful folly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.24'>Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine; let me bring them out now. Humble them, and do with them whatever seems good to your eyes; but to this man do not do such a disgraceful thing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.25'>But the men would not heed him. So the man took his concubine and brought her out to them. And they knew her and abused her wantonly all night until morning; and when the day began to break, they let her go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.26'>Then the woman came as the day was dawning, and fell down at the door of the mans house where her master was, till it was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.27'>And when her master arose in the morning, and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way, behold the woman, his concubine, fallen at the door of the house with her hands on the threshold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.28'>And he said to her, Get up and let us be going. But there was no answer. So the man lifted her onto the donkey; and the man rose up and went to his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.29'>And when he entered his house he took a knife, laid hold of his concubine, and divided her into twelve pieces with her bones, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.30'>And so it was that all who saw it said, No such deed has been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day. Determine, take counsel, and speak up!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.20'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.1'>So all the sons of Israel came out, from Dan to Beer-sheba, as well as from the land of Gilead, and the congregation assembled as one man, unto Jehovah at Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.2'>And the chiefs of all the people of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.3'>(Now the sons of Benjamin heard that the sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the sons of Israel said, Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.4'>And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, My concubine and I went into Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, to lodge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.5'>And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house at night because of me. They had thought to kill me, but instead they have humbled my concubine so that she died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.6'>So I took hold of my concubine, cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the land of the inheritance of Israel, because they have committed lewdness and disgraceful folly in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.7'>Behold, all of you are sons of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.8'>And all the people rose up as one man, saying, None of us shall go to his tent, nor shall any turn away to his house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.9'>but now this is the thing which we shall do to Gibeah: We shall go up against it by lot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.10'>We shall take ten men out of every hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to carry provisions for the people, that when they come to Gibeah in Benjamin, they may repay all the disgrace that they have done in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.11'>So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united as one man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.12'>And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What is this evil that has been done among you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.13'>Now therefore, deliver up the men, the sons of wickedness who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and remove the evil from Israel! But the sons of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brethren, the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.14'>And the sons of Benjamin gathered together from their cities to Gibeah, to go to battle against the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.15'>And from their cities at that time the sons of Benjamin numbered twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered seven hundred choice men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.16'>Among all this people were seven hundred choice men who were left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.17'>Now besides Benjamin, the men of Israel numbered four hundred thousand men who drew the sword; all of these were men of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.18'>And the sons of Israel arose and went up to the house of God to inquire of God. They said, Which of us shall go up first to battle against the sons of Benjamin? And Jehovah said, Judah first!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.19'>And the sons of Israel arose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.20'>And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.21'>And the sons of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and on that day destroyed down to the ground twenty-two thousand men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.22'>And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and again set the battle in array at the place where they had put themselves in array on the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.23'>And the sons of Israel went up and wept before Jehovah until evening, and asked counsel of Jehovah, saying, Shall I again draw near for battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin? And Jehovah said, Go up against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.24'>So the sons of Israel approached the sons of Benjamin on the second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.25'>And Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah on the second day, and destroyed down to the ground eighteen thousand men of the sons of Israel; all these drew the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.26'>And all the children of Israel, all the people, went up and came to the house of God and wept. They sat there before Jehovah and fasted that day until evening; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.27'>And the sons of Israel inquired of Jehovah (the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.28'>and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin, or shall I cease? And Jehovah said, Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.29'>And Israel set men in ambush all around Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.30'>And the sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in battle array against Gibeah as at the other times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.31'>And the sons of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city. They began to strike down and kill some of the people, as at the other times, in the highways (one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah) and in the field, about thirty men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.32'>And the sons of Benjamin thought, They are struck down before us, as at first. But the sons of Israel had said, Let us flee and draw them away from the city into the highways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.33'>So all the men of Israel rose from their place and put themselves in battle array at Baal Tamar. Then Israels men in ambush burst forth from their places in the plain of Geba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.34'>And ten thousand choice men from all Israel came against Gibeah, and the battle was heavy. But the Benjamites did not know that evil was upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.35'>And Jehovah struck down Benjamin before Israel. And the sons of Israel destroyed that day twenty-five thousand one hundred of Benjamin; all who drew the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.36'>So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were struck down. And the men of Israel had given ground to the Benjamites, because they had trusted on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.37'>And the men in ambush quickly rushed upon Gibeah; the men in ambush drew out and struck the whole city with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.38'>Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise up from the city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.39'>whereupon the men of Israel turned around in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty of the men of Israel. For they thought, Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.40'>But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and behold the whole city had gone up in smoke to the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.41'>And when the men of Israel turned back, the men of Benjamin were dismayed, for they saw that evil had come upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.42'>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness; and the battle overtook them, and whoever came out of the cities they destroyed in their midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.43'>They surrounded Benjamin, chased them, and easily trampled them down as far as the front of Gibeah toward the rising sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.44'>And eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all these were men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.45'>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon; and they thrust upon five thousand of them on the highways; and pursued them to Gidom, and killed two thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.46'>So all who fell of Benjamin that day were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these were men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.47'>But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they remained at the rock of Rimmon for four months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.48'>And the men of Israel turned back against the sons of Benjamin, and struck them down with the edge of the sword; entire cities, beasts, and all who were found. They also set fire to every city they found.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.21'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.1'>Now the men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah, saying, None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.2'>And the people came to the house of God, and remained there before God till evening, and lifted up their voices and wept with great weeping,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.3'>and said, O Jehovah the God of Israel, why has this come to pass in Israel, that today there should be one tribe missing in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.4'>And it came to pass the next morning, that the people arose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.5'>And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up with the assembly to Jehovah? For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who did not come up to Jehovah at Mizpah, saying, He shall die the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.6'>And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, One tribe is cut off from Israel today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.7'>What shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by Jehovah not to give them our daughters as wives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.8'>And they said, What one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to Jehovah? And, behold, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.9'>For when the people were numbered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.10'>And the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.11'>And this is the thing that you shall do: You shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has known a man by lying with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.12'>And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.13'>And the whole congregation sent word to the sons of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.14'>And Benjamin came back at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead; and yet they had not found enough for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.15'>And the people grieved for Benjamin, because Jehovah had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.16'>And the elders of the congregation said, What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.17'>And they said, There must be an inheritance for the remnant of Benjamin, that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.18'>However, we cannot give them wives from our daughters, for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.19'>Then they said, Behold, there is a yearly feast of Jehovah in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.20'>Therefore they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, Go, lie in wait in the vineyards,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.21'>and watch; and when the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance their dances, then come out from the vineyards, and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh; and go to the land of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.22'>And it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, Be gracious to them for our sakes, because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war; for it is not as though you have given the women to them at this time, thus making yourselves guilty of your oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.23'>And the sons of Benjamin did so; they took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they caught. And they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.24'>So the sons of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family; they departed from there, every man to his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.25'>In those days there was no king in Israel. Every man did what was right in his own eyes.</verse>
