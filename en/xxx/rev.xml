      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His servants; things which must happen quickly. And He sent and signified it by His angel to His servant John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>who bears witness to the Word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to all things that he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John, to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jesus Christ, the Faithful Witness, the Firstborn out from the dead, and the Ruler over the kings of the earth; to Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and has made us kings and priests to God, even His Father; to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will wail because of Him. Even so, Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, says the Lord, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I, John, both your brother and companion in the affliction and kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was on the island that is called Patmos because of the Word of God and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I came to be in the Spirit on the Lords Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last; and, What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamos, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>Then I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>Moreover His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>He had in His right hand seven stars, out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and His appearance was like the sun shining in its strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. And He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, Do not be terrified; I am the First and the Last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>To the angel of the church of Ephesus write, These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know your works, your labor, your patience, and that you cannot bear those who are evil. And you have tested those who say they are apostles and are not, and have found them to be liars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>and you have persevered and have patience, and have labored on account of My name and have not become weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent and do the first works; and if not, I will come to you quickly and remove your lampstand from its place; unless you repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the Tree of Life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write, These things says the First and the Last, who became dead, and lives:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I know your works, affliction, and poverty (but you are rich); and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Do not fear any of those things which you are about to suffer. Indeed, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have affliction ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt by the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write, These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I know your works, and where you dwell, where Satans throne is. And you hold fast to My name, and did not deny My faith even in the days in which Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to prostitute themselves to sexual immorality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Repent. But if not, I will come to you quickly and will make war with them with the sword of My mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give some of the hidden manna to eat. And I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written which no one knows except him who receives it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write, These things says the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet like fine brass:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know your works, and love, and service, and faith, and patience and your works; and the last being more than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>Nevertheless I have a few things against you, because you allow that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and lead astray My servants to prostitute themselves to sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I gave her time to repent of her sexual perversion, and she did not repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Indeed I will cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great affliction, unless they repent of their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>And I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches the inner thoughts and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>Now to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I will put on you no other burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>But hold fast what you have till I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>And he who overcomes, and keeps My works unto the end, to him I will give authority over the nations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>He shall rule them with a rod of iron; they shall be dashed to pieces like the potters vessels; as I also have received from My Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>and I will give him the Morning Star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>And to the angel of the church in Sardis write, These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you live, but you are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die, for I have not found your works being fulfilled before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Remember therefore how you have received and heard; hold fast and repent. Therefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not at all know what hour I will come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>You have a few names even in Sardis who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name from the Book of Life; but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, These things says He who is holy, He who is true, He who has the key of David, He who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it; for you have a little strength, have kept My Word, and have not denied My name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but lie; indeed I will make them come and bow the knee before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because you have kept the Word of My perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>Behold, I am coming quickly. Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall never go out any more. And I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of Heaven from My God; and My new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, These things says the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I would that you were cold or hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>So then, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because you say, I am rich, have become wealthy, and have need of nothing; and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Therefore be zealous and repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After these things I looked, and behold, a door having been opened in Heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>Immediately I came to be in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was set in Heaven, and One sat on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>And He who sat was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white robes; and they had crowns of gold on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And from the throne proceeded lightnings, thunderings, and voices. And seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>Before the throne there was a glassy sea, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>The four living creatures, each had six wings around, and were full of eyes within. And they do not rest day or night, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and do homage to Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and through Your will they exist and were created.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, having been sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loosen its seals?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no one in Heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>So I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open and read the scroll, or to look upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>But one of the elders said to me, Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and to loosen its seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I looked, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God having been sent out into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>Now when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they sing a new song, saying: You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open its seals; for You were slain, and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>and have made us kings and priests to our God; and we shall reign upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>saying with a loud voice: Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom, and strength and honor and glory and blessing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And every creature which is in Heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying: Blessing and honor and glory and power be to Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four living creatures said, Amen! And the twenty-four elders fell down and did homage to Him who lives forever and ever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals; and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a voice like thunder, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I looked, and behold, a white horse. He who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering, indeed in order to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>When He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And another horse, fiery red, went out. And it was granted to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth, and that people should kill one another; and there was given to him a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come and see. So I looked, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>So I looked, and behold, a pale green horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed behind him. And authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the Word of God and because of the testimony which they held.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And a white robe was given to each one of them; and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both the number of their fellow servants and their brethren, who were about to be killed as they were, was filled up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I looked when He opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its untimely figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>And the heavens separated as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>After these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>saying, Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees till we seal the servants of our God on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>And I heard the number of those who were sealed: One hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel were sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>Of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand were sealed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.6'>of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand were sealed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.7'>of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand were sealed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.8'>of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.9'>After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one was able to number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.10'>and crying out with a loud voice, saying, Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.11'>And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and fell on their faces before the throne and did homage to God,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.7.13'>Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, Who are these arrayed in white robes, and where did they come from?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.14'>And I said to him, Sir, you know. So he said to me, These are the ones coming out of great affliction, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.15'>Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple. And He who sits on the throne will spread His tabernacle over them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.1'>And when He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in Heaven for about half an hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.2'>And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.3'>And another angel, having a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.4'>And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God from the angels hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.5'>And the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth. And there were noises, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.6'>So the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.7'>And the first angel sounded: And hail and fire followed, mingled with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. And a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.8'>Then the second angel sounded: And something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.9'>And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.10'>Then the third angel sounded: And a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.11'>And the name of the star is called Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the water, because it was made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.12'>Then the fourth angel sounded: And a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.13'>And I saw, and I heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.1'>Then the fifth angel sounded: And I saw a star falling from heaven towards the earth. To him was given the key to the bottomless pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.2'>And he opened the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.3'>And out of the smoke locusts came forth upon the earth. And to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.4'>And they were commanded not to harm the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.5'>And it was given to them that they should not kill them, but to torment them for five months. And their torment is like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.6'>And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will crave to die, and death will flee from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.7'>And the shape of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. And on their heads something like crowns of gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.8'>And they had hair like womens hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.9'>And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots with many horses running into battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.10'>They had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. Their authority was to hurt men five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.11'>And they had as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.12'>One woe is past. Behold, two more woes come after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.13'>Then the sixth angel sounded: And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.14'>saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.15'>So the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released to kill a third of mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.16'>Now the number of the army of the horsemen was two hundred million; and I heard the number of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.17'>And thus I saw the horses in the vision: those who sat on them had breastplates being fiery like hyacinth and brimstone; and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths came fire, smoke, and brimstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.18'>By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed; by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which came out of their mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.19'>For their power is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads; and with them they do harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.20'>But the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not do homage to demons, and idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood, which are not able to see nor hear nor walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.21'>And they did not repent of their murders nor their sorceries nor their sexual perversions nor their thefts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.1'>And I saw another mighty angel coming down from Heaven, clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow was on his head, his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.2'>And he had a little book open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.3'>and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. When he cried out, seven thunders uttered their voices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.4'>Now when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and do not write them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.5'>And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised up his hand to Heaven</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.6'>and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created the heavens and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there should be no more time;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.7'>but in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel, whenever he is about to sound, the mystery of God would be finished, as He declared to His servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.8'>And the voice which I heard from Heaven spoke to me again and said, Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.9'>So I went to the angel and said to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me, Take and eat it; and it will make your stomach bitter, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.10'>And I took the little book out of the angels hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. But when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.11'>And he said to me, You must prophesy again before many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.1'>And I was given a reed like a staff. And the angel stood, saying, Arise and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who do homage there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.2'>But leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles. And they will tread the holy city underfoot for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.3'>And I will give to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.4'>These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.5'>And if anyone tries to harm them, fire proceeds from their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone tries to harm them, he must be killed in this manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.6'>These have authority to shut the heavens, so that no rain falls in the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.7'>And when they finish their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them, overcome them, and kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.8'>And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.9'>And those from the peoples, tribes, tongues, and nations will see their dead bodies three and a half days, and not allow their dead bodies to be put into graves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.10'>And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them, make merry, and send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.11'>And after three and a half days the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet, and great terror fell on those who saw them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.12'>And they heard a loud voice out of Heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they ascended towards Heaven in a cloud, and their enemies saw them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.13'>And in the same hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. In the earthquake seven thousand people were killed, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.14'>The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.15'>Then the seventh angel sounded: And there were loud voices in Heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world have been made those of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.16'>And the twenty-four elders who sat before God on their thrones fell on their faces and did homage to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.17'>saying: We give You thanks, O Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was and who is to come, because You have taken Your great power and reigned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.18'>And the nations were angry, and Your wrath has come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, and those who fear Your name, small and great, and should destroy those who destroy the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.19'>Then the temple of God in Heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple. And there were lightnings, voices, thunderings, an earthquake, and great hail.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.1'>Now a great sign appeared in the heavens: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.2'>And being with child, she cried out in labor and in pain to give birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.3'>And another sign appeared in the heavens: behold, a great, fiery red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.4'>And his tail drew a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to give birth, in order to devour her Child as soon as it was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.5'>And she bore a male Child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her Child was caught away to God and His throne.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.12.7'>And war broke out in Heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.8'>but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in Heaven any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.9'>So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who leads the whole world astray; he was cast out onto the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.10'>And I heard a loud voice saying in Heaven, Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.11'>And they overcame him through the blood of the Lamb and through the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives unto death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.13.1'>Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads names of blasphemy.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.17'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.1'>And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and talked with me, saying to me, Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.2'>with whom the kings of the earth prostituted themselves, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her sexual perversities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.3'>So he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.4'>And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the filthiness of her sexual perversities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.5'>And on her forehead a name was written: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.6'>And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And when I saw her, I marveled with great amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.7'>And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.8'>The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to ascend out of the bottomless pit and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth will marvel, whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.9'>Here is the mind which has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.10'>There are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come. And when he comes, he must continue a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.11'>And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes to destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.12'>The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority for one hour as kings with the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.13'>These are of one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.14'>These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those who are with Him are called, elect, and faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.15'>Then he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.16'>And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these will hate the harlot, make her desolate and naked, eat her flesh and consume her with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.17'>For God has put it into their hearts to fulfill His purpose, to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.18'>And the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.18.13'>and cinnamon and incense, ointment and frankincense, wine and oil, fine flour and wheat, beasts and sheep, horses and chariots, and bodies and souls of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.14'>And the fruit that your soul lusted for has gone from you, and all the things which are rich and splendid have gone from you, and you shall find them no more at all.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.18.17'>For in one hour such great riches is come to nothing. Every shipmaster, all who travel by ship, sailors, and as many as trade on the sea, stood at a distance</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.18'>and cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What is like this great city?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.19'>And they threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and wailing, and saying, Alas, alas, that great city, in which all who had ships on the sea became rich by her wealth! For in one hour she is made desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.20'>Rejoice over her, O Heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, for God has avenged you on her!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.21'>Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence the great city Babylon shall be thrown down, and shall by no means be found anymore.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.22.11'>He who is unjust, let him be unjust still; he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; he who is righteous, let him be righteous still; he who is holy, let him be holy still.</verse>
