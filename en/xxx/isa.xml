      <chapter osisID='Isa.1'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Give heed, O heavens, and hear, O earth! For Jehovah has spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, but they have rebelled against Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>The ox knows his owner, and the ass his masters manger, but Israel does not know; My people have not discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>Woe, sinful nation, a people heavy with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children who corrupt! They have forsaken Jehovah; they have scorned the Holy One of Israel. They are estranged backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>Why will you be stricken any more? Will you rebel more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart is faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it; only wounds and bruises and fresh stripes; they have not been closed nor bound up, nor has it been softened with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your land is a desolation; your cities burned with fire. Strangers devour your land before you; and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>Except Jehovah of Hosts had left us a small remnant, we would be as Sodom; we would be as Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Hear the Word of Jehovah, you rulers of Sodom. Give heed to the Law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>What good to Me are your many sacrifices, says Jehovah? I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of well-fed cattle; nor do I delight in the blood of bulls, of lambs, or he goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand, to trample My courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>Bring no more vain sacrifices; its incense is an abomination to Me. I cannot endure the new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies, and the wicked festivals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>My soul hates your new moons and your appointed feasts. They are a burden to Me; I am weary of bearing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>And when you spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you. Even though you multiply prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>Wash yourselves, purify yourselves. Put away the evil of your doings from My eyes; stop doing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>Learn to do good, seek justice, set straight the oppressor, judge for the orphan, plead for the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>Come now and let us reason together, says Jehovah: Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'>If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'>But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'>Oh how the faithful city has become a harlot! It was full of justice; righteousness lodged in it; but now, murderers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Your silver has become dross; your wine is diluted with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>Your rulers are rebellious and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe, and pursues rewards. They do not judge for the orphan, nor does the cause of the widow come before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>Therefore says the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah! I will be eased of My adversaries, and avenge Myself of My enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>And I will turn back My hand upon you, and refine your dross, as with lye, and remove all your alloy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>And I will return your judges as at the first; and your advisers, as at the beginning; then you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her returning ones with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together. And those who forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>For they shall be ashamed of the mighty trees which you desired; and you shall be ashamed of the gardens that you have chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>For you shall be like a mighty tree whose leaf fades, and like a garden that has no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>And the strong shall be as tinder, and the work as a spark; and they both shall burn together; and no one shall quench them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'>The Word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'>And it shall come to pass in the end times, that the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'>And many people shall go and say, Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob. And He will teach us His ways, and we will walk in His paths. For out of Zion the Law shall go forth, and the Word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>And He shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people. And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, nor shall they learn war anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>O house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>For You have forsaken Your people, the house of Jacob, because they have been consecrated from the east, and are fortunetellers like the Philistines, and they clap hands in worship with children of foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'>Their land is also filled with silver and gold. There is no end to their treasures. And their land is full of horses, neither is there any end to their chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>People prostrate themselves, men bow low; therefore You do not forgive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Enter into the rock and hide in the dust from the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of His majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The lofty eyes of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down; but Jehovah, He alone, shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>For the day of Jehovah of Hosts shall come upon all the proud and lofty ones, and upon all that is lifted up; and it shall be brought low;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>and upon all the cedars of Lebanon, high and lifted up; and upon all the oaks of Bashan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>and upon all the high mountains; and upon all the lifted up hills;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>and upon every tall tower; and upon every fortified wall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>and upon all the ships of Tarshish; and upon all desirable craft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'>And the pride of man shall be bowed down; and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'>And the idols shall completely pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'>And they shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, for the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of His majesty; when He rises up to make the earth tremble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'>In that day a man shall throw his idols of silver and gold, which they made each man to bow down to, to the moles and to the bats;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'>to go into the crevices of the rocks, and into the clefts of the cliffs, from the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of His majesty; when He rises up to make the earth tremble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'>Leave off from such a man, whose breath is in his nostril; for how is he to be accounted?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'>For behold, the Lord Jehovah of Hosts takes away the support and the staff from Jerusalem and from Judah; the whole support of bread and the whole support of water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'>the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'>the commander of fifty and the honorable man; the counselor and the skilled magician; and the expert enchanter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'>And I will give youth to be their rulers, and wanton children shall rule over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'>And the people shall be oppressed, man against man, every man by his neighbor. The youth will be insolent against the elder, and the dishonorable against the honorable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'>When a man shall take hold of his brother, in his fathers house, saying, You have clothing! Come, you be our ruler; let this ruin be under your power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'>In that day he shall lift himself up and say, I cannot be one who binds up; for there is neither bread nor clothing in my house; do not make me a ruler of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'>For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen; because their tongue and their deeds are rebellion toward Jehovah and against the eyes of His glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'>The expression of their faces witnesses against them; they have declared their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have recompensed evil upon themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'>Say to the righteous that it is well; for they shall eat of the fruit of their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'>Woe to the wicked! For the evil, the recompense of his hand, shall be done unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>As for My people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O My people, those leading you cause you to go astray, and they swallow the way of your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'>Jehovah stands up to plead His case, and stands up to judge the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'>Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of His people, and their rulers. For you have eaten up the vineyard, the plunder of the poor is in your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'>What do you mean that you crush My people, and grind the faces of the poor? says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'>Furthermore Jehovah says, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched out necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and make a tinkling with their feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'>therefore Jehovah will attach scabs to the top of the head of the daughters of Zion; and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'>In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, and their headbands, and their crescents of the moon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'>the pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'>the turbans, and the leg ornaments, and the sashes, and the perfume boxes, and the amulets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'>the rings and nose jewels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.22'>the festal apparel and the outer garments; and the mantles, and the purses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'>the mirrors and the fine linen; and the turbans and the veils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'>And it shall be, instead of a smell of perfume, there shall be an odor of decay. And instead of a belt, a rope. And instead of well set hair, baldness. And instead of a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'>Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'>And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall sit desolate on the ground.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'>And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothing; only let us be called by your name, to take away our reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'>In that day shall the Branch of Jehovah be beautiful and honorable, and the fruit of the earth excellent and glorious for those who have escaped from Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'>And it shall come to pass that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone who is recorded among the living in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.4'>when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from its midst by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.5'>And Jehovah will create over all the foundation of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.6'>And there shall be a booth for shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge and a shelter from storm and rain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'>Now I will sing to my Beloved a song of my Beloved concerning His vineyard. My Beloved has a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'>And He fenced it, and cleared out its stones, and planted it with choice vines, and built a tower in its midst, and hewed out a winepress in it; and He looked for it to produce grapes, but it produced rotten grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, please judge between Me and My vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'>What more could have been done to my vineyard that I have not done in it? Why then, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield rotten grapes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'>And now I will tell you what I will do to My vineyard; I will take away its hedge, and it shall be burned; and break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'>and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor dug; but briers and thorns shall come up. And I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'>For the vineyard of Jehovah of Hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are His pleasant plant. He looked for justice, but behold bloodshed; for righteousness, but behold an outcry!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'>Woe to those who join house to house, laying field to field, until there is no more space for you to dwell alone in the midst of the earth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'>Jehovah of Hosts said in my ears, Truly many big and pleasant houses shall be laid waste, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'>Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'>Woe to those who rise up early in the morning to pursue strong drink; remaining until the evening while wine inflames them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'>And the lute, and the harp, the tambourine, and pipe, and wine, are at their feasts; but they do not regard the work of Jehovah, neither do they give attention to the work of His hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'>For this My people have gone into captivity without knowledge, and their honorable men into famine, and their multitude dried up with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'>Therefore Sheol has enlarged itself, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their tumult, and he who exults, shall go down into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'>And people are prostrated, and great men are brought low and the eyes of the haughty are brought low.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'>But Jehovah of Hosts is exalted in justice, and the Mighty God, the Holy One, is sanctified in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'>Then shall the lambs feed in their pastures, and the waste places of the fat ones shall sojourners eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'>Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin with cart ropes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'>who say, Let Him hurry and hasten His work, so that we may see it; and let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, so that we may know it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.20'>Woe to those who call evil good and good evil; who put darkness for light and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.21'>Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and understanding in their own sight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.22'>Woe to those mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mix strong drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'>who justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away justice from the righteous!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'>Therefore, as the fire devours the stubble, and the flame consumes the chaff, so their root shall be like rottenness, and their blossoms shall go up like dust, because they have cast away the Law of Jehovah of Hosts, and despised the Word of the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'>Therefore the anger of Jehovah is kindled against His people, and He has stretched out His hand against them, and has stricken them; and the hills trembled, and their corpses were as refuse in the midst of the streets. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'>And He will lift up a banner to distant nations, and will whistle to them from the ends of the earth; and behold, they shall come with speed, swiftly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'>No one shall be weary nor stumble among them; no one shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the waistband of their loins be loosened, nor the thong of their sandals be broken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'>whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses hooves seem like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'>Their roaring shall be like a lion; they shall roar like young lions; and they shall roar and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and no one shall deliver it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'>And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea; and if one looks to the land, behold darkness and distress; and the light is darkened by clouds.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'>In the year that King Uzziah died I then saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'>Above it stood the seraphim; each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.3'>And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of Hosts; the whole earth full of His glory!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.4'>And the doorposts shook at the voice of the one who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.5'>Then I said, Woe is me! for I am undone! for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.6'>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from off the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.7'>And he applied it to my mouth and said, Lo, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is purged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.8'>And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us? Then I said, Here am I! Send me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.9'>And He said, Go, and tell this people, You listen to hear, but do not understand; you look to see, but do not perceive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.10'>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn back, and be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.11'>Then I said, Lord, how long? And He answered, Until the cities have been smashed to ruins without inhabitant, and the houses without a man, and the land is left devastated,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.12'>and until Jehovah has sent the men far away, and the desolation in the midst of the land is great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.13'>But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return and be consumed like the terebinth and like the oak when it is cut down, whose stump remains. The holy seed is its stump.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.7'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.1'>And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to make war against it, but could not prevail against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.2'>And it was told to the house of David, saying, Syria is allied with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest are swayed by the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.3'>Then Jehovah said to Isaiah, Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-Jashub your son, at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the highway to the Fullers Field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.4'>And say to him, Take care and be quiet. Do not fear, nor be softhearted because of the two tails of these smoking firebrands, because of the fierce anger of Rezin from Syria, and of the son of Remaliah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.5'>because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted against you, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.6'>Let us go up against Judah and trouble it, and break through the wall for ourselves, and set a king in the midst of it, the son of Tabeel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.7'>Thus says the Lord Jehovah, It shall not stand, nor shall it come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.8'>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken so that it shall not be a people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.9'>And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliahs son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.10'>Furthermore Jehovah spoke again to Ahaz, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.11'>Ask for a sign from Jehovah your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.12'>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, nor will I tempt Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.13'>And He said, Hear now, O house of David; is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.14'>Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.15'>Butter and honey He shall eat until He knows to refuse the evil and choose the good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.16'>For before the Child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that you loathe shall be forsaken by both its kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.17'>Jehovah shall bring upon you, and upon your people, and upon your fathers house, days that have not come since the days that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.18'>And it shall come to pass in that day that Jehovah shall whistle for the fly at the ends of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.19'>And they shall come, and all of them shall rest in the steep valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and on all the thorns, and on all the pastures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.20'>In the same day the Lord shall shave with a hired razor, with those beyond the River, with the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet, and it shall also snatch away the beard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.21'>And it shall be in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow and two sheep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.22'>so it will be that, from the abundance of milk which they shall give, that He shall eat butter; for everyone who is left in the land shall eat butter and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.23'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines, worth a thousand pieces of silver, it shall even be for briers and thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.24'>With arrows and with bows, men shall come there, because all the land shall become briers and thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.25'>And all hills which were hoed with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be a place to turn the ox loose, and for sheep to trample.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.8'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.1'>And Jehovah said to me, Take a large scroll and write in it with a mans pen: Maher-shalal-hash-baz. (which means, Hurry to the plunder! Make haste to the spoils!)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.2'>And I took to myself faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.3'>And I went in to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then Jehovah said to me, Call his name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.4'>For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.5'>Jehovah also spoke to me again saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.6'>Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliahs son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.7'>therefore behold, the Lord brings up upon them the waters of the River, strong and abundant, even the king of Assyria and all his glory; and he shall come up over all his channels and go over all his banks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.8'>And he shall pass through Judah. He shall overflow and go over; he shall reach to the neck. And the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of Your land, O Immanuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.9'>Suffer evil, O people, and be broken! Give ear, all you from distant lands. Gird yourselves and be broken. Gird yourselves and be broken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.10'>Take counsel and make plans, but they will be frustrated. Speak a word, but it shall not stand; for the Mighty God is with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.11'>For Jehovah spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and warned me against walking in the way of this people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.12'>Do not say, A conspiracy! to everything which this people calls, A conspiracy! And do not be afraid with their fear, nor be terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.13'>Sanctify Jehovah of Hosts Himself, and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.14'>And He shall be a sanctuary for you; but a stone of stumbling, and a rock of falling to both the houses of Israel; and a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.15'>And many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.16'>Bind up the testimony, seal the Law among My disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.17'>And I will wait on Jehovah, who hides His face from the house of Jacob; and I will watch for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.18'>Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah has given me, are for signs and for wonders in Israel, from Jehovah of Hosts who dwells in Mount Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.19'>And when they say to you, Consult the sorcerers and fortunetellers who peep and mutter; should not a people inquire of their God, rather than the living of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.20'>To the Law and to the Testimony! If they do not speak according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.21'>And they shall pass through it, hard-pressed and hungry; and it shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry, that they shall be enraged and curse their king and their God, and look upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.22'>And they shall look to the land; and behold, trouble and darkness and gloom of anguish! And they shall be thrust into darkness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.9'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.1'>Nevertheless the gloom shall not be upon her who was in distress, as in the former time when He brought contempt upon the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali. For afterwards He will glorify the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.2'>The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them the light has shined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.3'>You have multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy. They rejoice before You according to the joy at harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.4'>For You have broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his taskmaster, as in the day of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.5'>For every trembling boot of the warrior, and the garments rolled in blood, shall be fuel for burning in the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.6'>For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The Strong and Mighty God, The Eternal Father, The Prince of Peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.7'>Of the increase of His government and peace upon the throne of David there will be no end; and upon His kingdom, to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from now on, even forever. The zeal of Jehovah of Hosts will accomplish this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.8'>The Lord sent a Word to Jacob, and it has fallen upon Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.9'>And all the people shall know; Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and insolence of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.10'>The bricks have fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will use cedars instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.11'>Therefore Jehovah shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and spur his enemies on;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.12'>the Syrians in front and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.13'>For the people do not turn to Him who strikes them, nor do they seek Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.14'>Therefore Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and bulrush, in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.15'>The elder and honorable, he is the head; and the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.16'>For the leaders of this people lead them astray; and those who are led by them are swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.17'>Therefore the Lord shall not rejoice over their young men, nor shall He have mercy on their orphans and widows; for everyone is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks foolishness. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.18'>For wickedness burns like the fire; it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall billow up in a column of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.19'>Through the wrath of Jehovah of Hosts the land is scorched, and the people shall be as fuel for the fire; no man shall have compassion on his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.20'>And he shall cut off on the right hand and be hungry; and he shall devour on the left, and they shall not be satisfied. Each man shall eat the flesh of his own arm;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.21'>Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and together they shall be against Judah. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.10'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.1'>Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and who have written and continue to write toil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.2'>to thrust aside the needy from judgment, and to rob the right from the poor of My people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may plunder the orphans!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.3'>And what will you do in the day of judgment, and in destruction when it comes from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.4'>Without Me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. In all this His hand is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.5'>Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger! And the staff in their hand is My indignation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.6'>I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against the people of My wrath. I will command him to draw out the plunder, and to seize the spoils, and to trample them like the mud of the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.7'>Yet he does not plan this, nor does his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off not a few nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.8'>For he says, Are not my commanders all like kings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.9'>Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.10'>As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images excelled those of Jerusalem and Samaria;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.11'>shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Samaria and her idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.12'>And it shall come to pass, when the Lord has completed all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, that He will say, I will punish the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his haughty looks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.13'>For he says, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am discerning. And I have removed the borders of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.14'>And my hand has found, as a nest, the riches of the people; and as one gathers eggs that are left, I have gathered all the earth; and there was no one who moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.15'>Shall the ax boast itself against him who chops with it? Shall the saw magnify itself against him who moves it? As if the rod could swing itself at those who lift it up! As if a staff could rise up, as though it were not wood!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.16'>Therefore the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, shall send leanness among his fat ones; and under his glory He shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.17'>And the light of Israel shall be as a fire, and His Holy One as a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.18'>And it shall burn up the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, both soul and body; and they shall be as when a sick one faints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.19'>And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be so few, that a child might write them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.20'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob, shall never again lean on him who struck them; but will truly lean on Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.21'>The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob, to the Strong and Mighty God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.22'>For though Your people Israel are like the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return; the completion which is decreed shall overflow with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.23'>For the Lord Jehovah of Hosts shall make a full end, as ordained, in the midst of all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.24'>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, O my people who dwell in Zion, do not fear Assyria. He shall strike you with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against you, in the way of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.25'>But yet a little while, and the indignation shall cease, and My anger shall be for their destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.26'>And Jehovah of Hosts shall stir up a scourge upon him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and as His staff was on the sea, so shall He lift it up in the way of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.27'>And it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.28'>He has come to Aiath, he has passed to Migron; at Michmash he has stored his equipment;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.10.32'>Yet he shall remain at Nob that day; he shall shake his fist against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.33'>Behold, the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, shall lop off the bough with terror; and those exalted high shall be chopped down, and the haughty shall be humbled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.63.3'>I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no one with Me; for I tread them in My anger and trample them in My fury, and their blood is sprinkled on My garments, and I have stained all My apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.4'>For the day of vengeance is in My heart, and the year of My redeemed has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.5'>And I looked, and there was no one to help; and I wondered that there was no one to uphold; therefore My own arm has given victory for Me; and My fury sustained Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.6'>And I will tread down the people in My anger, and make them drunk in My fury, and I will bring down their blood to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.7'>I will mention the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah, the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah has bestowed upon us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel which He has bestowed upon them according to His mercies, and according to the multitude of His lovingkindnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.8'>For He said, Surely they are My people, children that will not lie; so He was their Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.9'>In all their affliction He was afflicted, and the Angel of His Presence saved them; in His love and in His pity He redeemed them; and He bore them, and carried them all the days of old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.10'>But they rebelled, and grieved His Holy Spirit; therefore He changed, to be their enemy, and He fought against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.11'>Then He remembered the days of old, Moses and His people, saying, Where is He who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of His flock? Where is He who put His Holy Spirit within him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.12'>who led them by the right hand of Moses with His glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make for Himself an everlasting name?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.13'>He led them through the deep, like a horse in the wilderness, so that they might not stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.14'>As a beast goes down into the valley, the Spirit of Jehovah caused him to rest. So You led Your people, to make for Yourself a glorious name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.15'>Look down from Heaven, and look down from the place of Your holiness and of Your glory. Where is Your zeal and Your strength, the multitude of Your tender affections and of Your mercies toward me? Are they restrained?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.16'>Indeed, You are our Father, though Abraham does not know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us. You, O Jehovah, are our Father, our Redeemer; Your name is from everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.17'>O Jehovah, why have You made us wander from Your ways, and hardened our heart from Your fear? For the sake of Your servants, return the tribes of Your inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.18'>The people of Your holiness have possessed it but a little while; our enemies have trampled Your sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.19'>We are from antiquity; You never ruled over them; they were never called by Your name.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.64'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.1'>Oh that You would rend the heavens and come down! That the mountains would quake at Your presence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.2'>as the brushwood fire burns, as the fire causes water to boil; to make Your name known to Your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at Your presence!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.3'>When You did awesome things which we did not look for, You came down, the mountains shook at Your presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.4'>For since ancient times they have not heard, nor been obedient. Eye has not seen any god besides You, who works for him who waits for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.5'>You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember You in Your ways (Behold, You were angry, for we sinned continually), and we shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.6'>But we are all like an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are like a menstruation cloth. And we all fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.7'>And there is no one who calls upon Your name, who stirs up himself to take hold of You. For You have hidden Your face from us, and have melted us away because of our iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.8'>But now, O Jehovah, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You are the One who forms us; and we all are the work of Your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.9'>Do not be greatly furious, O Jehovah, nor remember iniquity forever. Behold, please look. We all are Your people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.10'>Your holy cities are a wilderness; Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem is a desolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.11'>Our holy and beautiful house, where our fathers praised You, is burned up with fire; and all our pleasant things are laid waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.12'>Will You restrain Yourself over these things, O Jehovah? Will You be silent and greatly afflict us?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.65'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.1'>I am sought by those who asked not for Me; I am found by those who did not seek Me. I had said, Look to Me, Look to Me; to a nation that was not calling upon My name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.2'>I have spread out My hands all the day to a rebellious people who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.3'>a people who continually provoke Me to anger to My face; who sacrifice in gardens, and burn incense on altars of bricks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.4'>who remain among the graves, and spend the night in the tombs, who eat swines flesh, and the broth of unclean things in their vessels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.5'>who say, Keep to yourself, do not come near me; for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in My nose, a fire that burns all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.6'>Behold, it is written before Me; I will not be silent, but what I will repay; yea, I will repay into their bosom</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.7'>your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says Jehovah, who have burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed Me on the hills. Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.8'>Thus says Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Do not destroy it, for a blessing is in it; so I will do to My servants, that I may not destroy them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.9'>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah one who inherits My mountains; and My elect shall inherit it, and My servants shall dwell there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.10'>And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down, for My people who have sought Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.11'>But you are those who forsake Jehovah, who forget My holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who furnish the drink offering to Fate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.12'>Therefore I have assigned you to the sword; and you shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not hear, but did evil before My eyes, and chose that in which I have not delighted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.13'>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, My servants will eat, but you shall be hungry. Behold, My servants will drink, but you shall be thirsty. Behold, My servants will rejoice, but you shall be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.14'>Behold, My servants will sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl because of a crushed spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.15'>And you shall leave your name as a curse to My elect; for the Lord Jehovah will kill you, and call His servants by another name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.16'>He who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth. And he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from My eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.17'>For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth. And the former shall not be remembered, nor come to mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.18'>But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem as a rejoicing, and her people as a joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.19'>I have rejoiced in Jerusalem, and exulted in My people. And the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.20'>There shall not be an infant of only a few days, nor an old man that has not fulfilled his days. For the child shall die at a hundred years old; but the sinner who is a hundred years old shall be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.21'>And they shall build houses and live in them; and they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.22'>They shall not build, and another live in them; they shall not plant, and another eat. For as the days of a tree are the days of My people, and My elect shall grow old enjoying the work of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.23'>They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth children for terror. For they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.24'>And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.25'>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpents food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, says Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.66'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.1'>Thus says Jehovah, Heaven is My throne, and earth My footstool. Where, then, is the house that you would build for Me? And where is the place of My rest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.2'>For all those My hand has made, and all those exist, says Jehovah. But to this one will I have regard: To the lowly and contrite of spirit, and the one who trembles at My Word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.3'>He who kills an ox is as if he killed a man; he who sacrifices a lamb is as if he broke a dogs neck; he who offers an offering is as if he offered swines blood; he who burns incense is as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.4'>I also will choose the things that delude them, and I will bring their fears upon them, because when I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they have not obeyed. But they did evil before My eyes and have chosen that in which I have not delighted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.5'>Hear the Word of Jehovah, you who tremble at His Word: Your brothers who hated you, who cast you out because of My name, said, Let Jehovah be glorified. But He will appear for your joy, and they shall be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.6'>A roaring sound from the city, a sound from the temple, the sound of Jehovah repaying His enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.7'>Before she writhed in labor, she gave birth; before her pangs came, she delivered a male child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.8'>Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall the earth give birth in one day? Or shall a nation be born at once? For as soon as Zion had gone into labor, she had brought forth her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.9'>Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth, says Jehovah? Shall I beget, and then restrain the womb? says your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.10'>Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you who love her. Rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn for her;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.11'>that you may suckle and be satisfied with her comforting breasts; that you may suck milk and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.12'>For thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like a flowing stream. Then you shall suckle, you shall be carried on her sides and be dandled upon her knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.13'>As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.14'>And you shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the grass. And the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward His servants, and His indignation toward His enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.15'>For behold, Jehovah will come with fire and with His chariots like a tempest, to refresh His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.16'>For by fire and by His sword Jehovah will judge all flesh; and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.17'>Those who sanctify themselves, and purify themselves to go into the garden after an idol that is in its midst, eating swines flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall come to an end together, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.18'>For I know their works and their thoughts. It shall come to pass that I will gather all the nations and tongues; and they shall come and see My glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.19'>And I will set a sign among them. And those among them who escape I will send to the nations; to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud (who draw the bow), to Tubal, and Javan; to the far away coasts that have not heard of My fame, nor seen My glory. And they shall declare My glory among the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.20'>And they shall bring all your brothers for an offering to Jehovah out of all nations on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem, says Jehovah, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.21'>And I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.22'>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before Me, says Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.23'>And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, all flesh shall come to bow down before Me, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.24'>And they shall go out and observe the dead corpses of the men who have rebelled against Me. For their worm does not die, nor is their fire quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.</verse>
