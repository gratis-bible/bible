      <chapter osisID='Neh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.1'>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. It came to pass in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>that Hanani one of my brethren came with men from Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who had survived the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'>And they said to me, The survivors who are left from the captivity in the province are there in great distress and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'>So it was, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned for days; and was fasting and praying before the God of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'>And I said, I beseech You, O Jehovah the God of Heaven, O great and awesome Mighty God, You who keep Your covenant and mercy with those who love You and keep Your commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'>Let Your ear be attentive and Your eyes open, that You may hear the prayer of Your servant which I pray before You now, day and night, for the children of Israel Your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against You. Both my fathers house and I have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'>We have acted very corruptly against You, and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'>Remember, I beseech You, the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, If you act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the nations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'>but if you return to Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though you were cast out to the ends of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and bring them to the place where I have chosen to establish My name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'>Now these are Your servants and Your people, whom You have redeemed by Your great power, and by Your strong hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.11'>O Lord, I beseech You, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who delight to fear Your name; and give Your servant success this day, and grant him mercy before this man. For I was the kings cupbearer.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'>And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, that I took the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never been sad in his presence before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'>Therefore the king said to me, Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing but sorrow of heart. Then I was very much afraid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'>and said to the king, May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers tombs, lies waste, and its gates have been consumed with fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.4'>Then the king said to me, What do you request? So I prayed to the God of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.5'>And I said to the king, If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers tombs, that I may rebuild it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.6'>Then the king said to me (the queen also sitting beside him), How long shall your journey be? And when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.7'>Furthermore I said to the king, If it pleases the king, let letters be given to me to the governors of the region beyond the River, that they may allow me to pass through till I come to Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.8'>and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the kings forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the temple which pertains to the house, for the city wall, and for the house that I will occupy. And the king granted them to me according to the good hand of my God upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.9'>Then I went to the governors in the region beyond the River, and gave them the kings letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.10'>When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant the Ammonite, heard of it, it made them shudder over the great evil, that a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.11'>So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.12'>And I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem; nor was there any animal with me, except the one on which I rode.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.13'>And I went out by night through the Valley Gate, to the Serpent Spring and the Refuse Gate, and examined the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down, and its gates which had been consumed with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.14'>Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the Kings Pool, but there was no room for the animal under me to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.15'>So I went up in the night by the river, and examined the wall; then I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.16'>And the rulers did not know where I had gone or what I was doing; I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the rulers, or the others who did the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.17'>Then I said to them, You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer be a reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.18'>And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me, and also of the kings words that he had spoken to me. Then they said, Let us rise up and build. So they encouraged their hands for this good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.19'>But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the servant the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arab heard of it, they mocked and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.20'>So I answered them, and said to them, The God of Heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no portion or right or memorial in Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.1'>Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests and built the Sheep Gate; they consecrated it and set up its doors. As far as the Tower of Meah, they consecrated it; even as far as the Tower of Hananel.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'>But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, that he was furious and very indignant, and mocked the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'>And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they complete it in a day? Will they revive the stones from the heaps of rubbish; stones that are burned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'>Now Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, Whatever they build, if even a fox goes up on it, he will break down their stone wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'>Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their reproach upon their own heads, and give them as spoils to a land of captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'>Do not cover their iniquity, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before You; for they have provoked You to anger before the builders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'>So we built the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half its height, for the people had a heart to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'>And it came to pass, when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem had been restored up and the gaps had begun to be closed, that they were greatly infuriated,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.8'>and all of them conspired together to come and make war against Jerusalem and to create confusion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.9'>Nevertheless we prayed unto our God, and because of them we set a watch against them day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.10'>Then Judah said, The strength of the laborers is stumbling, and there is so much rubbish that we are not able to build the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.11'>And our adversaries said, They will neither know nor see anything, till we have come into their midst and killed them and put an end to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.12'>So it was, when the Jews who dwelt near them came, that they told us ten times, From whatever place you return, they will be upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'>Therefore I stationed men behind the lower parts of the wall, at the bare places; and I stationed the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'>And I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'>And it happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had broken their counsel, that all of us returned to the wall, each one to his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'>So it was, from that time on, that half of my servants did the work, while the other half held the spears, the shields, the bows, and wore armor; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'>Those who built on the wall, and those who carried burdens, loaded themselves so that with one hand they did the work, and with the other held a weapon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'>Every one who was building had his sword girded at his side as he built. And the one who sounded the shofar was beside me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'>Then I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, The work is great and extensive, and we are separated far from one another on the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'>Wherever you hear the sound of the shofar, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'>So we did the work, and half of the men held the spears from the rising of the dawn until the stars came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'>At the same time I also said to the people, Let each man and his servant lodge inside Jerusalem, that they may be a guard to us by night and workers by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'>So neither I, my brethren, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes, except that everyone sent them away for washing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>And there was a great outcry of the people and their wives against their brothers the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'>For there were those who said, We, our sons, and our daughters are many; therefore let us get grain, that we may eat and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>There were also some who said, We have mortgaged our fields and vineyards and houses, that we might buy grain because of the famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'>There were also those who said, We have borrowed money for the kings tax on our fields and vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'>Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and indeed we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters have been brought into slavery. It is not in our power to redeem them, for other men have our fields and vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'>And I was extremely infuriated when I heard their outcry and these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'>After serious thought, I rebuked the nobles and rulers, and said to them, Each of you is exacting usury from his brother. So I appointed a great assembly against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'>And I said to them, According to our ability we have redeemed our brothers, the Jews who were sold to the nations. Now indeed, will you even sell your brothers? Or should they be sold to us? Then they were silenced and found nothing to answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'>Then I said, What you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'>I also, with my brethren and my servants, am lending them money and grain. Now let us leave off this usury!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'>Restore now to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also a hundredth of the money and the grain, the new wine and the oil, that you have charged them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>So they said, We will restore it, and will require nothing from them; we will do as you say. Then I called the priests, and caused them to swear that they would do according to this word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>I also shook out empty the bosom of my garment and said, So may God shake out each man from his house, and from his property, who does not carry out this word. Even thus may he be shaken out and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen! and praised Jehovah. Then the people did according to this word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'>Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers have eaten the food of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'>But the former governors who had been before me were heavy on the people, and took from them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people, but I did not do so, because of the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'>Indeed, I also prevailed in the work of this wall, and we did not buy any land. All my servants were gathered there for the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'>And at my table were one hundred and fifty Jews and rulers, besides those who came to us from the nations around us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.18'>Now that which was prepared daily was one ox and six choice sheep. Also fowl were prepared for me, and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine. Yet in all of this I did not demand the food of the governor, because the labor was heavy on this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.19'>Remember me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.1'>Now it came to pass when Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall, and that there were no breaks left in it (though at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'>that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do evil to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'>So I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and come down to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'>But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.5'>Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before, the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.6'>In it was written: It is reported among the nations, and Geshem says, that you and the Jews plan to rebel; for which reason, according to these rumors, you are rebuilding the wall, that you may be their king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.7'>And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah! Now these matters will be reported to the king. So come, therefore, and let us consult together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.8'>Then I sent to him, saying, No such things as you say are being done, but you contrive them out of your own heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.9'>For they all were trying to make us afraid, saying, Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will not be done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.10'>Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was under restraints; and he said, Let us gather in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you; indeed, at night they will come to kill you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.11'>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? And who is there such as I who would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.12'>Then I perceived that God had not sent him, but that he had spoken this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.13'>For this reason he was hired, that I should be afraid and do accordingly and sin, to make for a bad reputation, that they might reproach me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.14'>My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat, according to these works of theirs, and the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who were terrifying me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.15'>So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.16'>And it came to pass when all our enemies heard of it, and all the nations around us saw these things, that they were cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work had been done by our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.17'>Also in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and those from Tobiah came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.18'>For many in Judah were pledged to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had taken in marriage the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.19'>They also reported his good deeds before me, and were delivering my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to make me afraid.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.1'>Now it came to pass when the wall was built and I had set up the doors, when the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.2'>that I gave the charge of Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.3'>And I said to them, Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut and bar the doors; and appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each one at his post, each across from his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.4'>Now the city was broad and large, but the people in it were few, and the houses were not rebuilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.5'>Then my God put it into my heart to gather the nobles, the rulers, and the people, that they might be registered by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of those who had come up in the first return, and found written in it:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.8'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.1'>Now all the people gathered together as one man in the open square that was in front of the Water Gate; and they commanded Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses, which Jehovah had charged Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.2'>So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly of men and women, and all who could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.3'>And he read from it in the open square that was in front of the Water Gate from morning until midday, before the men and women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the Book of the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.4'>So Ezra the scribe stood on a platform of wood which they had made for the purpose; and beside him, at his right hand, stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Urijah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah; and at his left hand Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.5'>And Ezra opened the book in the eyes of all the people, for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.6'>And Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God. Then all the people answered, Amen, Amen! while lifting up their hands. And they bowed down and prostrated themselves before Jehovah with their faces to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.7'>Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, helped the people to understand the Law; and the people stood in their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.8'>So they read distinctly from the book, in the Law of God; and they gave the sense, and helped them to understand the reading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.9'>And Nehemiah, who was the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, This day is holy to Jehovah your God; do not mourn nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the Words of the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.10'>Then he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Do not sorrow, for the joy of Jehovah is your refuge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.11'>So the Levites quieted all the people, saying, Be still, for the day is holy; do not be grieved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.12'>And all the people went their way to eat and drink, to send portions and rejoice greatly, because they understood the Words that had been declared to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.13'>Now on the second day the heads of the fathers of all the people, with the priests and Levites, were gathered to Ezra the scribe, in order to have insight into the Words of the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.14'>And they found written in the Law, which Jehovah had commanded by the hand of Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths during the feast of the seventh month,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.15'>and that they should announce and proclaim in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, Go out to the mountain, and bring olive foliage, foliage of oil trees, myrtle foliage, palm foliage, and foliage of leafy trees, to make booths, as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.16'>Then the people went out and brought them and made themselves booths, each one on their roofs, or in their courtyards or the courts of the house of God, and in the open square of the Water Gate and in the open square of the Gate of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.17'>So the whole assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and sat under the booths; for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day the children of Israel had not done so. And there was very great gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.18'>Also day by day, from the first day until the last day, he read from the Book of the Law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the prescribed manner.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.9'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.1'>Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, in sackcloth, and earth upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.2'>Then the seed of Israel separated themselves from the children of the foreigners; and they stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.3'>And they stood up in their place and read from the Book of the Law of Jehovah their God for a fourth part of the day; and for another fourth they confessed and prostrated themselves before Jehovah their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.4'>Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the stairs of the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to Jehovah their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.5'>And the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said: Stand up and bless Jehovah your God forever and ever! Blessed is Your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.6'>You alone are Jehovah; You have made the heavens, the Heaven of the heavens, with all their host, the earth and everything on it, the seas and all that is in them, and You preserve them all alive. The host of the Heavens bow down before You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.7'>You are Jehovah God, who chose Abram, and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans, and placed upon him the name Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.8'>You found his heart faithful before You, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, and the Girgashites; to give it to his seed. You have performed Your words, for You are just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.9'>You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.10'>You gave signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, upon all his servants, and upon all the people of his land. For You knew that they had acted proudly against them. So You made a name for Yourself, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.11'>And You divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and those pursuing them You threw into the deep, as a stone into the mighty waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.12'>Moreover You led them by day with a cloudy pillar, and by night with a pillar of fire, to give them light on the way which they should travel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.13'>You came down also on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from the heavens, and gave them just ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.14'>You made known to them Your holy Sabbath, and commanded them precepts, statutes and Laws, by the hand of Your servant Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.15'>You gave them bread from the heavens for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and intended for them to go in to possess the land which You had raised Your hand and sworn to give them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.16'>But they and our fathers acted presumptuously, hardened their necks, and did not heed Your commandments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.17'>and refused to obey, and they were not mindful of Your wonders that You did among them. But they hardened their necks, and in their rebellion they appointed a leader to return to their bondage. But You are God, ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, abundant in kindness; and did not forsake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.18'>Even when they made a molten calf for themselves, and said, This is your god that brought you up out of Egypt, and worked great blasphemies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.19'>yet in Your manifold mercies You did not forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of the cloud did not depart from them by day, to lead them on the road; nor the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way they should go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.20'>You also gave Your good Spirit to teach them, and did not withhold Your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.21'>Forty years You sustained them in the wilderness. They lacked nothing; their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.22'>Moreover You gave them kingdoms and nations, and divided them into districts. So they took possession of the land of Sihon, the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.23'>You also multiplied their children as the stars of the heavens, and brought them into the land which You had commanded their fathers to go in and possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.24'>So the people went in and possessed the land; You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.25'>And they captured strong cities and a rich land, and took possession of houses full of all goods, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate and were filled and grew fat, and lived luxuriously in Your great goodness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.26'>Nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against You, cast Your Law behind their backs and killed Your prophets, who testified against them to turn them to Yourself; and they worked great blasphemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.27'>Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their enemies, who distressed them; and in the time of their trouble, when they cried out to You, You heard from Heaven; and according to Your abundant mercies You gave them deliverers who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.28'>But after they had rest, they returned to doing evil before You. Therefore You left them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them; yet when they returned and cried out to You, You heard from Heaven; and many times You delivered them according to Your mercies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.29'>and testified against them, that You might bring them back to Your Law. Yet they acted presumptuously, and did not heed Your commandments, but sinned against Your judgments, which if a man does, he shall live by them. And they shrugged their shoulders, stiffened their necks, and would not obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.30'>Yet for many years You had patience with them, and testified against them by Your Spirit by the hand of Your prophets. Yet they would not listen; therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.31'>Nevertheless in Your great mercy You did not annihilate them nor forsake them; for You are the Mighty God, gracious and merciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.32'>Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and awesome Mighty God, who keeps covenant and mercy: Do not let all the trouble seem small before You that has found us, our kings and our rulers, our priests and our prophets, our fathers and all Your people, since the days of the kings of Assyria until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.33'>However You are just in all that has come upon us; for You have dealt faithfully, but we have done wickedly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.34'>Neither our kings nor our princes, our priests nor our fathers, have kept Your Law, nor paid attention to Your commandments and Your testimonies, with which You testified against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.35'>For they have not served You in their kingdom, nor in the great goodness that You gave them, nor in the large and rich land which You set before them; nor did they turn from their evil works.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.12.47'>In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the portions for the singers and the gatekeepers, a portion for each day. They also consecrated holy things for the Levites, and the Levites consecrated them for the sons of Aaron.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.3'>So it was, when they had heard the Law, that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.5'>had prepared for him a large room, where previously they had stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the utensils, the tithes of grain, the new wine and oil, which were commanded to be given to the Levites and singers and gatekeepers, and the offerings for the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.6'>But during all this I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, I had come to the king. Then after certain days I obtained leave from the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.7'>and I came to Jerusalem and perceived the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.8'>And it grieved me exceedingly; therefore I threw all the household goods of Tobiah out of the room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.9'>Then I commanded them to purify the rooms; and I brought back into them the utensils of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.10'>I also perceived that the portions for the Levites had not been given them; for each of the Levites and the singers who did the work had fled to his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.11'>So I contended with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together and set them in their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.12'>Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil into the storehouse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.13'>And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouse Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered faithful, and their task was to distribute to their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.14'>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its services.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.15'>In those days I saw people in Judah treading wine presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I admonished them about the day on which they were selling food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.16'>Men of Tyre dwelt there also, who brought in fish and all kinds of merchandise, and sold them on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, even in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.17'>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that you do, profaning the Sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.18'>Did not your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us and upon this city? Yet you bring added wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.19'>So it was, at the gates of Jerusalem, as it began to be dark before the Sabbath, that I commanded the gates to be shut, and charged that they not be opened till after the Sabbath. Then I posted some of my servants at the gates, so that no burdens should be brought in on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.20'>So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of merchandise lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.21'>Then I warned them, and said to them, Why do you spend the night around the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you! From that time on they came no more on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.22'>And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should go and guard the gates, to consecrate the Sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of Your mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.23'>In those days I also saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.24'>And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and could not speak the Jewish language, but according to the tongue of nation to nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.25'>So I contended with them and cursed them, struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.26'>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him, who was beloved of his God; and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.27'>Should we then hear of your doing all this great evil, acting treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.28'>And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I drove him from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.29'>Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.30'>Thus I cleansed them of everything foreign. I also appointed duties to the priests and the Levites, each to his service,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.31'>and for the wood offering and the firstfruits at the appointed times. Remember me, O my God, for good!</verse>
