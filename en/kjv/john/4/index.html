Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many more believed because of his own word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
