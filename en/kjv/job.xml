        <description>In 1604, King James I of England authorized that a new translation of the Bible into English be started. It was finished in 1611, just 85 years after the first translation of the New Testament into English appeared (Tyndale, 1526). The Authorized Version, or King James Version, quickly became the standard for English-speaking Protestants. Its flowing language and prose rhythm has had a profound influence on the literature of the past 300 years.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>And Job spake, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'>Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>But Job answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'>Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'>What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'>The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'>Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.41.15'>His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.16'>One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.17'>They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.18'>By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.19'>Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.20'>Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.21'>His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.22'>In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.23'>The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.24'>His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.25'>When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.26'>The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.27'>He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.28'>The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.29'>Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.30'>Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.31'>He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.32'>He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.33'>Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.34'>He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.42'>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.1'>Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.2'>I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>He had also seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.17'>So Job died, being old and full of days.</verse>
